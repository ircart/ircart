[Chorus]
WE FLY HIGH, NO LIE, YOU KNOW THIIIIS (BALLIN!)
FOREIGN RIDES, OUTSIDE, IT'S LIKE SHOWBIIIIIZ (IN THE BUILDIN!)
  WE STAY FLY, NO LIE, AND YOU KNOW THIIIIS
  HIPS AND THIGHS, OH MY, STAY FOCUSEEEEED

[Jim Jones]
Ya boy getting paper, I'm buying big cars
85 rides just to drive in my garage (CHOOSE ONE!)
Stay sky high, fly with the stars (TRIPLE TRIPLE!)
G4 flights, eighty grand large (BALLIIIIIIIING!)
So we lean with it rock with it (BANKHEAD!)
Convertible Jones, mean with the topless (FLOSSING!)
I'm sitting clean with a model chicken (DO IT!)
I hopped out, saggy jeans and my rock glisten (BALLIIIIIIIING!)
But I spent about eight grand
mami on stage doing the rain dance (I THINK SHE LIKE ME!)
She let it hit the floor and made it pop (what else?)
Got my pedal to the floor screaming fuck the cops

[Chorus]

[Jim Jones]
Slooow dooown.....here tonight could be gone tomorr' (one chance)
So I speed through life like there's no tomorr' (SPEEDING!)
Hundred G's worth of ice on the Audemars (flossing)
And we in the street life til they call the law
I made the whip get naked (what happened?)
while I switched gears bitch looking at the bracelet
Step out, show me what you all about
flashbacks of last night of me balling out
1 A.M we was at the club
2 A.M ten bottles of Bub
And by three something I was thinking 'bout grub
so I stumbled to the car thru the drinks and the drugs (twisted)

[Chorus]

[Jim Jones]
Could you buy that? I keep 20 in the pocket (light change)
We can talk a buck 80 if the Bentley is the topic (THAT GREY POUPON!)
But of course got the flyest bird
to the hood and roll dice on side the curb
Now I know a G a bet might sound absurd (get ya money up)
Try 80 up Lennox cause I got a urge (speeding)
The rap game like the crack game
lifestyle rich and famous living in the fast lane
SO WHEN I BLEEP SHORTY BLEEP BACK
LOUIS VUITTON BELT WHERE I'M KEEPIN ALL THE HEAT STRAPPED!
I beat the trial over Rucker
all guns loaded and I'm back motherfucker!

[Chorus]
