[Verse 1: Mannie Fresh]
This is for Deshawn, Eshlawn, Lil Mama, an her friends
Lisa, Teresa, Maria, Tia, Lia and Kim
I love y'all broads, no disrespect to my dogs
but I love y'all broads, yea I love y'all broads
To the ladies havin babies without no drama
To my niggas with figgas say I love my baby momma
I bought them shoes, them tattoos, an even fixed yo breasts
I put you inside the flyest rides an even put a "S" on yo' chest

[Verse 2: Lil' Wayne]
This is for the ones who wobbled it an be puttin they mouth on it
An they suck everything out of it then they catch it and swallow it
I'm Lil Weezy for sheezy, I'm off the heezy believe me
See me, I squeeze in between it, and then I leave it so greasy
When I come through in a Rolls Royce, leave them with no choice
but to hop up in it an just let me make they throat moist
Ruby red an vodka it just carry a nigga
Give me three minutes maybe four she be wantin to marry a nigga

[Chorus 2X: Juvenile]
Give me a project bitch
Give me a hoodrat chick
One that don't give a fuck
An say she took that dick

[Verse 3: Juvenile]
My momma send me by my grandma, my grandma flipped out
an said we ain't gone have no evil in this house
So I rolled out scoped me an ounce sold out
but I fucked up when I started livin up in this hoes house
Nigga started fuckin one of the broads
cause she was suckin a nigga dick so good keepin it hard
Lettin a nigga cum all over her chest and tongue
She was still-un, I spared her because her chil-drun
She was a hoe she gave me head behind a building
aint sellin records but her mouth could sell a million
if you wanna take it there we can break it off 
cause yall pussy aint gotta nigga tweakin at all
I slang this dick summer winter spring an the fall
ask me to lay it down I'm bringin it all
I'm tryin to hit ya from the back til ya holla, "Good lord
this motherfuckin dick good and it always be hard"

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: Baby]
Look - a nigga could catch me r'd up
Them white folks know the code so we g'd up
an my range rover 4 door be d'd up
Tattoos and new cars and these project cuts
Got this nigga bitch I know been wantin to fuck
I deal with sluts ladies an bitches don't give a fuck
Project bosses Weezy say "Respect Us"
Bitch nigga find me in the 4 door Lexus
I got a bitch shoot dice an a bitch that ain't right
I got a bitch who will front ya work an take ya life
I got a credit card hoe, a scam type hoe, a fraud type hoe
Like to snort that dope, a dick suckin pro
A calico hoe, a real solid bitch out Chicago
I got a +Brat+ type bitch like to whine an shit
I got a project bitch like to start some shit

[Chorus til fade]
