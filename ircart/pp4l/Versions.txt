                        (1) ShowDowN PrO Versions Info

 -----------------------------
 º<×> °ShowDowN v3.5 PrO° <×>º
 (For mIRC 4.6 at October '96)
 -----------------------------

   The first version of ShowDowN PrO that was publicly released ! This is really
 nothing more today than a collectors item. It all started from here. It's quite
 amazing how much the script has gone better from this version. But you know, it
 all has to start somewhere. Even the Rome was not built in one day. This version
 had users globally about 200.

 ---------------------------------
 -=º<×> °ShowDowN v4.5 PrO° <×>º=-
 (For mIRC 4.7 at December '96)
 ---------------------------------

   The script got better as I learned more about the mIRC scripting. I guess this
 means that ShowDowN PrO was growing up with me. As it still is today. Though the
 script wasn't very advanced at the time, this version had it's faithful users.
 I have all other ShowDowN PrO versions saved, but not this one (damn!). So if
 someone has this version, please send it to me :) Had users around 500 or so.

 ---------------------------------
 -=º<×> °ShowDowN v5.5 PrO° <×>º=-
 (For mIRC 4.72 at February '97)
 ---------------------------------

   With this release, ShowDowN PrO made it's final breaktrough, and got into the
 hearts of many people. This version was introducing for the first time the WaR
 and Normal popup modes of the script, that are almost legendary nowadays, and
 an essential part of the script even today. The unique look and the style of the
 script was starting to form in this version that even got some awards from mIRC
 scripting websites. This version got pretty famous and had users over 2000.

 ---------------------------
 <=- °ShowDowN v6.5 PrO° -=>
 (For mIRC 5.02 at July '97)
 ---------------------------

   I worked quite hard to make this version possible. Introduced very much cool
 and useful new features. Since the previous version had done the breaktrough
 already, it was very easy for this version to get very popular and receive users
 worldwide. The own style of ShowDowN PrO that points it out from other mIRC
 scripts was shaped into it's final form. One could say, that it can only get
 better from here. This version had it's moments and got total users over 5000.

 ------------------------------
 <=- °ShowDowN v7.5 PrO° -=>
 (For mIRC 5.3 at December '97)
 ------------------------------

   Since a quite big break in the development of ShowDowN PrO, I decided to get
 back in to work again. I had received huge amounts of supporting and encouraging
 e-mails from the script's users and I just couldn't let them all down by
 dropping the development. Users of my script are special and all VERY important
 to me, and that's a fact. This version introduced a great deal of new features
 and was supporting the new mIRC features better. Since the previous versions had
 done so well, it was not hard to get well over the 10000 users limit.

 ------------------------------
 <=- °ShowDowN v7.7 PrO° -=>
 (For mIRC 5.31 at January '98)
 ------------------------------

   This was an update version where I included the features that were left out
 from the last release. This is among the alltime most used mIRC scripts for
 sure. A big thanks for that goes to you, script users. Thanks everyone for
 the support I have received. But note that upgrading a script this big is
 really hard work and takes up lots of time and money. On to the next version...

 ---------------------------
 <=- °ShowDowN v8.5 PrO° -=>
 (For mIRC 5.4 at July '98)
 ---------------------------

   Winds of change started to blow as this was the biggest update to ShowDowN PrO
 so far. The amount of new cool features was almost overwhelming. For this new
 version, I had almost totally rewritten the script's code, help files and other
 related files. Many unique features were introduced, that couldn't be found from
 anywhere else. And what was among the biggest and most awaited new things in the
 script was the chance to REGISTER it to yourself. This was also the first time
 that it had ever been done in a mIRC script. But ShowDowN PrO was gotten used to
 showing way to the other scripts. This version had also gone trough an extremely
 long beta testing phase to sort out all possible bugs. And what was cool is that
 now you could participate and contribute to the script by REGISTERING it against
 a very small amount of money. Due to that, I can keep on producing better and
 more advanced versions of this script for you to enjoy. Thank you very much for
 all that REGISTERED their copy. Remember that the REGISTRATION is valid for all
 the future versions also. So anyway, this version was the first one I was very
 satisfied of. This was the script's comeback and a final breaktrough as I also
 had planned it. It's true that over 100.000 people have tried out this version.

 ------------------------------
 <=- °ShowDowN v9.5 PrO° -=>
 (For mIRC 5.41 at January '99)
 ------------------------------

   This was a version I actually coded while I was in the army, doing my military
 service(!). I guess this shows how much dedication I have towards this "job" as
 I may call it today. Let me tell you a little story about this... We had a one
 month break in the military training. Other guys were playing games and watching
 movies but not me. I brought my computer to the base and planted it into a small
 office at the top floor. I sat there everyday from morning to late night coding
 SD PrO, drinking soda and smoking cigarettes. Hehe, that was against the strict
 regulations though... but it was essential for the development =D Oh, those were
 the days. There were quite remarkable new features in this one, including a
 chance to turn ON/OFF all script's colours, the menubar themes and languages.
 People really appreciated these, and they provoked me to make effort boosting up
 the configurability in ShowDowN PrO. I assume after this version, all the
 expectations had to be very high for people that had gotten used to the good
 quality and range of features. The script homepages broke the 500000 visitors
 limit. I worked much on the script homepage, making it a cool place to visit.

 --------------------------------
 °ShowDowN v10 PrO°
 (For mIRC 5.61 at January '2000)
 --------------------------------

   I had big difficulties finding time to make this version, since I had so
 little spare time. I took my time to arrange things in my real life. Got out of
 the army, moved to a bigger apartment, bought a new car and got a new job. When
 all of this was done, I could sit back and start to code a new version of the
 script again. And I worked really hard on this version. I actually coded 8 hours
 almost every day for a month. A total facelift was done to ensure easy usage.
 Professional dialog setups, themes for popups, adjustable protections, dynamic
 menus etc. etc. URL for the script homepage changed to www.sci.fi/~showdown/.

 -----------------------------
 °ShowDowN v11 PrO°
 (For mIRC 5.71 at June '2000)
 -----------------------------

   This script version, as usual, was full of new exciting and unseen features.
 From these, my favorite would have been be the Script Skins addition. The script
 used more dialogs throughout. Key words are: clear user interface, easy to use,
 comprehensive, good design and WORKING items. All setups can be seen to come
 from the same script and that's important. Indeed. °ShowDowN PrO° Shop opened.
 This version was quite good, no major bugs or anything. Background pictures and
 titlebar Skins have been a good success. Keep sending them to me !

 ---------------------------------
 ((ShowDowN v12 PrO))
 (For mIRC 5.82 at February '2001)
 ---------------------------------

   This is the fun part. All the coding is behind and the new script version just
 can't wait to be released. °ShowDowN PrO° has come a very long way from year
 1996 to 2001. That's a long time for a mIRC script, actually °ShowDowN PrO° is
 the world's oldest mIRC script still updated. That's really something, don't you
 think? Anyway, I save all (useful) feedback e-mails I get. This time I gave an
 extra strong effort to make all requested features. The ratio-FileServer was the
 most requested feature I think. The script is more network compatible than ever
 before, will work in: IRCNet, EFNet, DALNet, UnderNet, GalaxyNet, AustNet, MSN
 Chat etc. You are using the best script in the world and I intend to keep it
 that way with updates and new versions. All I can say now is that with the help
 of all people who have REGISTERED their copy, I am able to do all this. I hope
 you like this new release and continue to support my work by  REGISTERING your
 copy. Not much asked now is it ? Just one letter. See you in ShowDowN v13 PrO.

---------------------------------
 ((ShowDowN v12 PrO) r²)
 (For mIRC 5.91 at October '2001)
 ---------------------------------

   This is an update to fix all the problems that mIRC's changed command formats
 and properties caused. Version number is not changed because features aren't
 added much, just been updated fixed. I am sorry that you had to wait so long for
 this release but I was so busy with all my several IRL projects. I am making a
 careed as a singer too nowadays besides all other things. °ShowDowN PrO° LIVES !

 * SMALL UPDATE! (March 2003):
 I had to remove the WaR Clones totally from the script. They were triggering
 false alarms with some virus scanners. And anyway, they are useless nowadays.

             -----------------------------------------------------
                        (2) Script Future / Development
             -----------------------------------------------------

   The development has taken a new turn now that so many people offer their help.
 I get offered free sites, graphics, coding assistance, advertising, co-operation
 offers and the list goes on. In the future, I will continue to make all the code
 and design of the script myself. I am sorry but the only one I can trust about
 it is me. I am accepting lots of graphics, external programs and stuff that have
 been essentially made for ShowDowN PrO. Keep it going, I really appreciate that.
