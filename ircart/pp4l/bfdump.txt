so.. its been exactly a week now since i stopped trying to contact him. im all alone out here in Germany on my year abroad, with only 2 months left to go... and he dumps me now.
its so ridiculous, and im so upset. it was getting easier, but all of a sudden i dont seem to be able to deal with it now.
im suddenly so depressed, and overeating, and i cant stop myself. Why hasn't he text me? how can i be that bad a person that I deserve to be treated like this?
i am so sad. so alone. Richard... i hate you for doing this to me... just when things were going so right for me. I can't do my work.. I don't even wanna live right now. You are so cruel.
