 Once upon a time there was a girl named Brittany.

Brittany was not like most girls...she was very modest and not slutty AT ALL...despite what others may think.
She was afraid to get close to others because she was in an abusive relationship for three years that she could not get out of.
So after that ended..she just kept to herself. For a long time.

Then one day, about six or seven months ago..she met a guy. The way they met was so cliche. but whatever. That's not really the point.

To make (kind of) a long story short..she started to fall for him, but was carefull because of what happened with her first boyfriend. He didn't act interested in her at first, but she liked that. She always got mixed signals from him, but she didn't really care...

It was not until a little while later that she found out that (or so she thought) that he no longer had feelings for her..

So of course, there was only one thing for Brittany to do..

Move on.

And by moving on..she started talking to someone else..
and she did not think that it would be a big deal.
But obviously, she was wrong.

She started hearing shit from EVERYONE about it...including YOU
Even though it's not really what they think...

Now everything is weird.. and she feels like shit.

THE END..



Well...Now the whole world knows how I feel..and everytime I tried to tell you how I really felt you would always try to contradict me. But whatever..now everyone knows.
and honestly..I didn't think that you would care.
I just wish that you would talk to me about it..I don't want to argue about it anymore..I just want to be friends..


Well now that everyone knows my fucking life story...this is all I have to say..

ATTN MYSPACE: I AM NOT A SLUT...(cough cough...Blake).
and I'm sorry, for whatever it is that I did to you.
