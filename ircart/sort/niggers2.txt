Nigger, nigger; tell them lies,
Black face and bloodshot eyes.
Crooked toes and crooked nose,
That's the way a nigger goes!
(That's how he goes!) 

They're marchin' for equality.
They'll never be as good as me.
We won't let him integrate.
We must always segregate.
(Keep them in their places!) 

Nigger, nigger; tell them lies,
Black face and bloodshot eyes.
Crooked toes and crooked nose,
That's the way a nigger goes! 

Ole' Martin Luther's got to go.
That's one thing that we all know.
We'll take him riding on a rail,
And lock him in the county jail! 

Niggers want to change our ways,
With taxes they won't ever pay.
Monkey lips and kinky hair,
Living off that ole' welfare.
(Got their hand out!) 

They might as well give up the fight.
No federal judge can make them white.
The job is up to you and me, 
Let's beat the N double ACP
(Move em' North!) 

Nigger, nigger; tell them lies,
Black face and bloodshot eyes.
Crooked toes and crooked nose,
That's the way a nigger goes!
That's the way a nigger goes!
That's the way a nigger goes!
That's the way a nigger goes!
