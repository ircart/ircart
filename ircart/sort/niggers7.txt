If you smell something funny
When you walk down the street
You're in Coontown.
You look and see garbage
All over the street
You're in Coontown. 

Up and down the street
There ain't nothing but trash.
Nigger girls trying to get
A nigger boy's cash.
Then you even see a spook
With a big moustache
In Coontown. 

On the corner there's a nigger
With a drink in his hand.
That's Coontown.
Trying to bum a nickle
From whoever he can
In Coontown. 

And don't be surprised
You can make a bet.
If you go back tomorrow
He'll be there yet.
He's trying to get drunk
And drunk he's gonna get
In Coontown. 

Niggers never bother
About going to work
In Coontown.
They seem to think
That work is for jerks
Out of Coontown. 

He don't do nothing
But sleep and doze.
He don't wake until his eyes
Are tired of being closed.
It's half a day's work
For him to scratch his toes
In Coontown. 

It amazes me
To see the way they live
In Coontown.
They do all the taking
While we have to give
To Coontown. 

The white man worries,
The nigger don't care
Cause at the end of the month
His check will be there.
Every nigger earns his living
Off the old welfare
In Coontown. 

Every nigger earns his living
Off the old welfare
In Coontown.
