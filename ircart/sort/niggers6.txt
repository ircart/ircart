A NIGGER'S lookin' today,
For that big welfare check,
He will get when the man brings his mail.
By his mailbox he'll stand,
With his black outstretched hand.
Will there be any checks in his mail? 

Will there be any checks?
Welfare checks in his mail?
Will there be any checks in his mail?
When he waits with the rest,
Of the ones that Lyndon's blessed, 
Will there be any checks in his mail? 

He might go sit-in today,
At some White restaurant.
All his kind needs to be in the jail.
He don't do any work,
He don't pay any taxes,
But he looks for that check in his mail! 

Now will there be any checks?
Welfare checks in his mail?
Will there be any checks in his mail?
When he waits with the rest,
Of the ones Lyndon's blessed, 
Will there be any checks in his mail? 

Oh what pleasure niggers find,
When their pockets are lined,
With the money, that White taxes pay.
Ah, but if you mention WORK,
He'll weep and he'll wail.
All he wants is that check in his mail. 

Oh, will there be any checks?
Any checks in his mail?
Will there be any checks in his mail?
When he waits with the rest,
Of the ones Lyndon's blessed, 
Will there be any checks in his mail? 

ALL TOGETHER!!
Will there be any checks?
Welfare checks in his mail?
Will there be any checks in his mail?
Now, when he waits with the rest,
Of the ones that Lyndon's blessed, 
Will there be any checks in his mail? 

TELL EM' ONE MORE TIME!!!
Will there be any checks?
Welfare checks in his mail?
Will there be any checks in his mail?
