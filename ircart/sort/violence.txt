at school, i took my best friend's brand new super-rare tamagotchi and put it into a sink full of water without him knowing.
he went over to the sink in the classroom to wash his hands and screamed and began to cry.
a few days later i punched him full force in the throat and smashed his lips into his braces because he smiled smugly at me when i forgot to hand in some work to another teacher.
i got punished lightly, and kicked his face in outside school the very next day, after he'd been to hospital.
he's still my friend though...we feel each other's penises sometimes.
