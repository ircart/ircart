The Stallion
A full grown stallion's cock, when fully erect, will measure some two to
three feet long.  It can be three to six inches thick at the base, to about
two inches thick at the head.  Horses are somewhat different from other
animals in the way their cock head works.  When a horse is fully erect and
excited and ready to mount, his cock head is somewhat pointed and not as
thick as might be normally observed.  This is to facillatate an easier
entry into the mare.  After the horse has entered and reaches a climax the
head swells (though it is more spongy then hard) into a fist sized mass as
he ejaculates.  It is thought that this serves as a plug to force the
semen deep into the mare rather then allowing it to leak out.  A full grown
stallion can ejaculate about one cup ( 8 ounces ) of semen.  It will take
quite a few spurts to accomplish this.  Each time his tail will raise and
lower in a brief flick.  The first few jets are of a thin to average
consistency of cum.  The final few jets are of a thick gelatinous
substance... it is thought that this serves to "seal" the mares pussy so
that the semen has time to do it's thing before leaking out.  Horse semen
is extremely viscous, if you touch your finger to a pool of it you can draw
a thin string of it five to six feet long!  Horse cum has a nice flat taste
to it...not at all bitter like man's cum.  You can easily drink cups of it
with no discomfort.
