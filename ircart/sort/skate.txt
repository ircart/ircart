FACT: Skateboards were originally based off the toy 'Tech Decks' but were overshadowed extremely by the Z-Boys in the 1970's with skateboarding and struggled to gain popularity until the late 90's. With many young teenagers realizing their inability to skate on a real life board, they began bringing miniature skate boards to class and performing 'grinds' and 'flips', awing their classmates with shit a 5 year old could do.
