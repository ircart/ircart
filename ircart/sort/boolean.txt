I THINK BOOLEANS ARE A BAD IDEA IN PROGRAMMING

AFTER ALL WHAT IS THE POINT SINCE YOU KNOW THAT THINGS
ARE TRUE OR FALSE KIND OF TO START WITH

I MEAN OBVIOUSLY 3 IS TRUE AND -6 IS FALSE RIGHT ????

A LIST WITH ODD ELEMENTS IS TRUE BUT A LIST WITH ODD
ELEMENTS IS FALSE

A PAIR OF NUTS IS TRUE AND A PAIR OF BALLS IS FALSE
RIGHT ???? RIGHT ????????

I THINK BUILDING ANYTHING INTO A BOOLEAN SHOULD BE
ILLEGAL BECAUSE I HAVE NO PENIS

I THINK THE OBVIOUS PROPER SOLUTION IS THAT A BOOLEAN TYPE
SHOULD BE A STRUCT WITH TWO MEMBERS: "NOTUNTRUE" AND
"NOTCOMPLETELYCORRECT"

SO WHEN YOU WANT TO SET IT TRUE YOU SET NOTUNTRUE TO 7 AND
WHEN YOU WANT IT FALSE YOU SHOULD SET IT TO
NOTCOMPLETELYCORRECT

ARE YOU TAKING NOTES

YES I'M TALKING ABOUT PEP 285
