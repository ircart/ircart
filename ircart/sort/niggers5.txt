You niggers, listen now.
I'm gonna tell ya how
To keep from getting tortured when the Klan is on the prowl.
Stay at home at night, 
And lock your doors up tight.
Don't go outside, or else you'll find
Those crosses a-burnin' bright! 

Now I know you won't believe me,
So I'm gonna tell you why
The Kajun Ku Klux Klan is gonna get you by and by.
I'm warning you that when I'm through,
You're going to change you're tune.
This story's bout a NIGGA!
His name was Levi Coon. 

He walked into a café.
He thought he'd get a bite.
He thought that they would serve him,
Since they passed the Civil Right.
The waitress told him "No",
And that he'd better go.
He said, "No mam, my Uncle Sam,
Say I don't have ta go!" 

So he sat there in that café,
Being stubborn as a mule.
No matter what she said,
He wouldn't get up off that stool.
He sat there like a jackass,
Said, "I'm gonna demonstrate!
I came in here ta eat,
An' I ain't leavin' till I'z ate!" 

The waitress had enough.
She said, "I'll call your bluff".
She said, "If we can't treat you right,
We'll have to treat you rough".
The phone was in her hands.
She gave him one more chance.
He wouldn't go and so she called,
The Kajun Ku Klux Klan! 

When he saw them Kajuns comin',
Levi knew it was too late.
His eyes popped out his head,
And his kinky hair got straight!
He said, "O' lawzy, White folk,
I didn't mean a thing!
Why did I have to listen
To that demonstrator King?" 

Now, niggers, understand.
They tied up both his hands.
He was at the mercy of the Kajun Ku Klux Klan!
I knew just what they'd do.
Levi knew it, too.
I knew what kind of torture
They would put that nigger through! 

Now, the moral of this story
Is plain as it can be.
Niggers, mind your business!
And let us White folk be!
You'd better heed my warning,
And try to understand,
Don't you demonstrate,
Around the Kajun Ku Klux Klan!
