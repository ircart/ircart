I put my hand in my pocket
What do I feel
One hundred and ten stories
Of concrete and steel
I like to watch

That plane-shaped hole
Really gets me hot
But the big ball of fire
Is the money shot
I like to watch

I like to watch
The plane going in
I like to watch
The flame shooting out
People dive into the street
While I play with my meat
My steel melted
and my tower's coming down

The New York skyline
Will never be the same
But the guys who flew those planes
Had fucking amazing aim
I like to watch

There must have been a reason
But I don't understand
Why they hit the Pentagon
Instead of Disneyland
I like to watch

I like to watch
The plane going in
I like to watch
The flame shooting out
It's raining broken glass
While I sit on my ass
My steel melted
and my tower's coming down

I'd almost had enough
Of watching planes explode
Until they showed it in reverse
And I had to shoot my load
I like to watch

Now my hand's all sticky
And I can't find a rag
I guess I'll have to use
The american flag
I like to watch
