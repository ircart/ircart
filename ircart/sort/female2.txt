There's this trap at my school who is supposedly going through the initial stages of his transition from male to female, and I've noticed now that this semester, he's in one of my Jazz classes. He never speaks or even looks around. He comes in, takes his notes, leaves, and I guess leaves campus. He doesn't seem to have any friends and he never looks anyone in the eye, because they always stare, like they're trying to figure out if he's
a guy or a chick. He actually looks pretty female, more than male, so not everyone can tell, I've seen. Just today, I was on an overpass that connects one of the main buildings to my class building, and I heard crying. So I walked around trying to find where it was coming from, and I see him, all huddled up in the corner crying into his hands and smoking a cigarette, his mascara and makeup all running over his face. When I got to
him, I asked him what was wrong and he immediately falls into my chest and starts bawling, right there. So, I get him to calm down, and when I ask him again, I shit you not, he tells me he wants me to fuck him hard, like, to the point of rape. I'm pretty shocked by this, but every time I ask him what he's talking about, he tells me to shut the fuck up and take me to his apartment and rape the shit out of him and then leave him there
alone. So, what could I do? He's in the shower right now, and I snuck on his computer.  I have one question before he gets out.
