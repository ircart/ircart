0,8The giraffe (Giraf0,4fa cam0,8elopardalis) is an African even-toed ungulate mammal, t0,4he tall0,8est living terrestrial animal and the  
0,8largest ruminant. 0,4Its spe0,8cies name r0,4efers 0,8to its camel-l0,4ike a0,8ppearance and the p0,4atches o0,8f color on its fur. Its chief        
0,8distinguishing cha0,4racteri0,8stics are i0,4ts extr0,8emely long 0,4neck an0,8d legs, its horn-li0,4ke ossi0,8cones and its distinctive coat        
0,8patterns. It stands 0,045–6 m0,8 (16–20 ft) 0,4tall a0,8nd has an a0,4verage 0,8weight of 1,600 kg (3,500 lb) for 0,4males0,8 and 830 kg (0,041,800,080 lb)   
0,8for fem0,4ales. I0,8t is classified under 0,4the fa0,8mily Giraffidae,0,4 al0,8ong with its closest extant rela0,4tive, th0,8e okapi. 0,4The 9   0,8       
0,8subspe0,4cies are d0,8istinguished by their0,4 coa0,8t patterns.                    0,4       0,8             0,4          0,8        0,4        0,8       
0,8The gi0,4raffe's sc0,8attered range extends from Chad in the north to South A0,4frica in t0,8he south, an0,4d from Ni0,8ger in t0,4he west 0,8to     
0,8Somali0,4a in the e0,8ast. Gira0,4ffes0,8 usually inhabit savannas, grasslands, a0,4nd open woodl0,8ands. Their 0,4primary0,8 food sour0,4ce is a0,8cacia  
0,8leaves,0,4 which t0,8hey brows0,4e at h0,8eights most other herb0,4ivore0,8s cannot re0,4ach. Giraffes a0,8re preyed on b0,4y l0,8ions, and calves are also
0,8targeted by0,4 le0,8opards, sp0,4otted 0,8hyenas and wild dogs.0,4 Adult g0,8iraffes do0,4 not have stro0,8ng social bonds, though they do gather in 
0,8loose aggregations if th0,4ey ha0,8ppen to be moving in t0,4he same 0,8general di0,4rection. Mal0,8es establish social hierarchies through     
0,8"necking", which are combat bouts where the neck is0,4 used as 0,8a weapon.0,4 Dominant0,8 males gain mating access to fema0,4le0,8s, which    
0,8bear the sole responsibility for rai0,4sing0,8 the young. 0,4       0,8                                                  0,4       0,8         
0,8The giraffe has intrigued various 0,4cultures0,8, both ancient0,4 a0,8nd modern, for its peculiar appea0,4rance, 0,8and has of0,4ten been0,8 featured
0,8in paintings, books and cartoons. 0,4It is cl0,8assified by the International Union for Conserva0,4tion of N0,8ature as 0,4Least Co0,8ncern,   
0,8but has been extirpated from many pa0,4rts o0,8f its former range, and some subspecies are class0,4ified as 0,8Endangered0,4. Neve0,8rtheless, 
0,8giraffes are still found in numerous national parks and game reserves.                       0,4    0,8
