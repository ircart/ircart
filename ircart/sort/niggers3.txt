I like sugar
And I like tea.
But I don't like niggers,
Yes sir-ree.
There's two lone things
That'll make me puke.
That's a hog eatin' slop
And a big black spook. 

You know it, 
Cuz I show it.
Like a barnyard rooster I crow it!
And the N double ACP
Would sure like to get ahold of 
nigger hatin' me. 

Roses are red
And violets are blue
And niggers are black.
You know that's true.
But, they don't mind,
Cause what the heck?
You gotta be black
To get a welfare check. 

And I'm broke,
No joke.
I ain't got a nickle
For a coke.
And I ain't black, you see
So Uncle Sam won't help
Poor nigger hatin' me. 

Jiggaboo, jiggaboo,
Where are you?
"Iz here in da woodpile
Watchin' you."
Jiggaboo, jigaboo
Come out!
"Nawsir, Iz scared o' de white man
Way down south." 

You know it,
Cuz I show it.
Stick your black head out
And I'll blow it.
And the N double ACP
Can't keep you away from
Little ole nigger hatin' me. 

Mirror, mirror
On the wall,
Who is the blackest
Of them all?
A man named King,
and there ain't no doubt.
And he's causing lots of trouble
With his baboon mouth. 

The ruin he's a-doin'
Is caused by the trouble
He's a-brewin'.
And the N double ACP
Can't win if the white men stick
With nigger hatin' me. 

Hey, Mr. President,
What do you say?
When are we whites
Going to have our day?
The niggers had theirs
Such a long, long time.
I'm a white, and it's time
That I have mine. 

You know it,
Cause I show it.
Stick your black head out
And I'll blow it.
And the N double ACP
Can't win if the white men stick
With nigger hatin' me. 

Nigger hatin' me…
Nigger hatin' me…
Nigger hatin' me…
Nigger hatin' me.
