I was up for three days and was new to the drug; so new that I was unaware that one could hallucinate while under its' influence. I was alone (friends had gone home) and was left with the pile of crystal. I proceeded to cut lines and get spun.
My girlfriend called, who was away on a business trip, and tried to tell me about her trip. I, however, had to stop the conversation short because I was videotaping a mammoth anaconda preparing to strike a cat in the field behind our apartment in the field--or so I thought. The tape, viewed three days later, revealed nothing of the sort, just bushes and my shakiness.
Later that night while trying to poop (unsuccessful) I noticed that the hand towels hanging above the sink were waving. At this point I realized that I was experiencing visuals, but did not realize that the albino anaconda seen earlier was a visual.
So, here is where I almost got fucked:
t about 2AM I though someone was stealing my bike. It was locked up to the stairway outside my apartment's front door. I could see people trying to steal it through the peephole. I even spoke to them. I said "I am calling the cops!". They told me to open the door. So I had no choice, I called the cops.
Well, luckily, a part of self preservation kicked in and I realized that I had called the cops on myself while I was fucked up on meth. There were no bike thieves, just my overactive brain at work.
So now it is 2AM, I am spun and the cops are on their way. So I thought fast. I collected up the meth, put it into a freezer bag and buried it in the cat box. I also sucked down 7 beers before they showed up.
Thank I forced the beer down and also the fact that the Union City police are slow as fuck. By the time they showed up I had some signs (smell, slurred speech) of the booze. So I didn't appear to be a meth head spinning. They left immediately.
I learned not about meth abuse, butI learned about the affects of sleep deprivation.
