				Analysis of the three dominant types of individual using IRC

Type A: The projector

	The projector is a very common type of IRC user, he can be found predominantly on the well
	established and older IRC networks (e.g. EFnet (including all the co-dependant sub-networks of circle-jerk
	eltisim (e.g. ircII)). It is fairly easy to actually identify an IRC user (thereafter to be referred to as
	ircer, luser, user, et al.), as they project the rules and parameters of their everyday real-life onto IRC
	and aspire to create a haven of well-mannered communicative `staying in touch with your friends'. To put this
	brief and simple: the users whom I refer to as `projectors' will appear to be slightly more emotional than your
	average ircer and will just talk and act like they would in their real lives (with the exception of those individuals
	amongst the projectors who actually do not have such a thing as a real life).

	Fictional example of two projectors interacting:

	<LillyOnTheNet> god I hate this boy so much; sometimes I really wish he would die from AIDS
	<Peter23> please do not speak like that. I had a friend who died from AIDS and it makes me sad to see people
		  abusing the stigmatism and the usual guaranteed mortality associated with this sickness so carelessly
	<LillyOnTheNet> oh I am sorry petey ;) I didn't know that. I won't do it again.

	Type A.II: The projector attention-whore

		Since this type of IRCer does not provide enough difference to the projector as it is, it is not substantial enough
		to be eligible to receive their own classification. If my research however shall bring forward a greater distinctiveness
		as assumed, this may or may not change.

		The P. attention whore is usually female and does not fit into any kind of `norm physical appearance' (meaning:
		they may or may not be hot - however will always act as if they are the most delicious eye-candy to have ever set
		foot on this planet). She does show the same kind of attitude in reallife however has lost a considerably large
		amount of friends as an immediate cause of that. Hence she is trying to get her needs for attention catered to 
		from a proverbial legion of mindless losers that would do anything for her, struggling for her recognition
		with a latent hope of `tapping that'.

		Fictional example of an attention-whore and her minions interacting:

		<candice> omg like im so sad
		<gr1d> why are you sad sexy sweet little applepie? tell me!
		<candice> omg like fuck off like i dont even care about you
		<gr1d> *rawr* being a kitty with claws today? <3

	Type A.III: The projector pseudo-authorative jerk

		Same as above. This is just a sub-type of the projector.
		
		The pseudo-authorative jerk will always act like he thinks of himself as the boss. Usually he will only
		talk to other pseudo-authorative jerks.

		Fictional example of two pseudo-authorative `old school IRCers' (i.e. projecters) and some autists (see below).

		<m0par> hey everyone ;)
		<rap0m> hey m0pey ;) how was your meeting today?
		<alfonzo-chan> PooooooOooOOoOoOOooooOooOOoOoOOooooOooOOoOoOOooooOooOOoOoOOooooOooOOoOoOOooooOooOOoOoOOooooOooOOoOoOOooooOooOOoOoOOo
		<infid3l> *emo**cut**emo**cut**emo**cut**emo**cut**emo**cut**emo**cut**emo**cut*
		<m0par> huh? the kids up late today? ;)
		<rap0m> seems so ;)
		m0par sets mode: +m to #LateNightTalkOnIRC
		<m0par> there seems to be solved ;) 
		<rap0m> so anyway, what were we talking about?

		


	Common fashion of communication utilized: blatant, boring blogging

Type B: The autist

	The autist is a crass opposite of the projector. He will not engage in social activity whatsoever (this might bel
	caused by a complete absence of social skills / experiencing in interacting with other human beings of any kind).
	Usually,
