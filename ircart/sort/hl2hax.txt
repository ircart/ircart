<Unknown__> [05:48:28] [|_TooL_|]: > Condition Zero, within the hour
<Unknown__> again a quote, possibly from <bw>
<Unknown__> just before condition zero rls
<Unknown__> [05:51:26] [|_TooL_|]: CZ soon
<Unknown__> [05:51:34] [|_TooL_|]: within the hour

<Unknown__> [07:14:25] [|_TooL_|]: ^
<Unknown__> [07:14:32] [|_TooL_|]: its 1.9GB
<Unknown__> [07:16:08] [+|_TooL_|]: kinda
<Unknown__> [07:16:11] [+|_TooL_|]: but
<Unknown__> [07:16:14] [+|_TooL_|]: its 1.9GB
<Unknown__> [07:16:23] [+|_TooL_|]: im trying to see about just CZ
<Unknown__> [07:17:02] [+x]: Nessun was saying they weren't able to or smth
<Unknown__> [07:17:21] [+|_TooL_|]: well
<Unknown__> [07:17:30] [+|_TooL_|]: he's not close to it as i am
<Unknown__> [07:21:11] [+|_TooL_|]: http://www.uploadit.org/files/091003-anon-czero.nfo
<Unknown__> [07:21:54] [+|_TooL_|]: 1.9GB
<Unknown__> [07:22:01] [+|_TooL_|]: i guess it included HL
<Unknown__> [07:22:15] [+|_TooL_|]: no way to do CZ by itself
<Unknown__> [07:22:17] [+|_TooL_|]: i guess
<Unknown__> [07:23:06] [+|_TooL_|]: ill have it in 60seconds
<Unknown__> [07:23:15] [+|_TooL_|]: so ill know if i should strip CZ out
<Unknown__> [07:23:21] [+|_TooL_|]: and rar just CZ only orwhat
<Unknown__> [09:38:08] [+Nessun]: heh well the new news is cs2 and tf2 in a couple days im hoping
<Unknown__> [09:38:23] [+Nessun]: and tool i have screen shots and vids oif condition zero already
<Unknown__> [10:33:06] [+Nessun]: [04:38:35] [@Nessun] http://platinum09.swaza.com/cz2.jpg

<Unknown__> [10:33:15] [+Nessun]: [04:38:37] [@Nessun] http://platinum09.swaza.com/cz1.jpg
<Unknown__> .
<Unknown__> that would pretty much sum up a lot of incriminating information
<Unknown__> it seems that
<Unknown__> |_tool_| and Nessun coordinated releases
<Unknown__> brought them to the public
<Unknown__> a 3rd party guy <bw> procured the files and packed them on a remote box (possibly hacked)
<Unknown__> with the source being in germany as |_tool_| said
<Unknown__> which would very possibly be Ago
<Unknown__> who posted all the internal valve info quoted on top
<Unknown__> I will be disappearing
<Unknown__> if you want to know more, just put a message I'll understand on the website and I might come
<Unknown__> What these people did simply has gone too far and caused immense damage to one of the best game companies around
