For the last year I have been dealing with denial of service attacks from
 users using servers hosted with your company. I recently discovered that
 they are scanning for cisco routers with default login/passwords and then
 using those to launch massively parallel ICMP attacks against hosts. I have
 a list of thousands of hosts that these servers have accessed illegally and
 used to commit denial of service attacks.

 Here are the currently logged in users into the hacked cisco router being
 used in denial of service attacks. Note that both of these hosts are owned
 by the same person or his associates through your hosting company.

 >sh users
     Line       User       Host(s)              Idle       Location
    6 vty 0                idle                 00:02:58 92.51.164.205
    7 vty 1                idle                 00:02:49 87.230.95.90

 Please take some time to investigate these claims as this has been ongoing
 for quite some time. If these hosts continue to commit illegal acts upon my
 network and others I will contact the administrators of all the others
 affected hosts to bring legal litigation upon your company for failing to
 remove the illegal activity.

 Here is a list of hosts that were illegally accessed by said computers:
 66.0.17.66
 200.0.30.28
 69.0.59.138
 72.0.103.94
 72.0.105.41
 66.0.113.97
 200.0.255.4
 69.1.98.1
 69.1.107.1
