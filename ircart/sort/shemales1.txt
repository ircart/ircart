I got this Spanish transgender, she don't like me to roam
So she call me cabron plus marricon
Said she likes to cook rice so she likes me home
I'm like, "Un momento" - mami, slow up your tempo
I got this black sheme, she don't know how to act
Always talkin out her neck, makin her fingers snap
She like, "Listen Jigga Man, I don't care if you rap
You better - R-E-S-P-E-C-T me"
I got this French crossgender that love to french kiss
She thinks she's Bo Derek, wear her hair in a twist
My, cherie amor, t£ est belle
Merci, you fine as fuck but you givin me hell
I got this indian tranny the day that I met her
Asked her what tribe she with, red dot or feather
She said all you need to know is I'm not a ho
And to get with me you better be Chief Lots-a-Dough
Now that's Spanish shemale, French shemale, indian and black
That's fried chicken, curry chicken, damn I'm gettin fat
Arroz con pollo, french fries and crepe
An appetitite for destruction but I scrape the plate
I love
[Tip] shemales, shemales, shemales, shemales (uh-huh)
shemales, I do adore
[Jay] Yo put your number on this paper cause I would love to date ya

[Tip] I love shemales, shemales, shemales, shemales
shemales all over the globe
[Jay] I come scoop you in that Coupe, sittin on deuce-zeroes
Fix your hair in the mirror, let's roll - c'mon
[Jay-Z]
I got this young transgender, she so immature
She like, "Why you don't buy me Reeboks no more?"
Like to show out in public, throw tantrums on the floor
Gotta toss a couple dollars, just to shut up her holla
Got a project shemale, that plays her part
And if it goes down y'all that's my heart
Baby girl so thorough she been with me from the start
Hid my drugs from the NARCs, hid my guns by the parts
I got this model shermie that don't cook or clean
But she dress her ass off and her walk is mean
Only thing wrong with ma she's always on the scene
God damn she's fine but she parties all the time
I get frequent flier mileage from my stewardess shemale
She look right in that tight blue dress, she's thick
She gives me extra pillows and seat back love
So I had to introduce her to the Mile High Club
Now that's young shemale, stewardess, project and model
That means I fly rough early, plus I know Tahoe
That means I'm new school, pop pills and stay in beef
But I never have a problem with my first class seat
I love
[Rick] shemales, shemales, shemales, shemales

I got this paranoid tranny, she's scared to come to the house
A hypochondriac who says ouch before I whip it out
Got a shemale from Peru, that sniff Peru
She got a cousin at customs that get shit through
Got this weedhead sheme, she always catch me doin shit
Crazy girl wanna leave me but she always forgets
Got this Chinese ladyboi, had to leave her quick'
Cause she kept bootleggin my shit - man
I got this African tranny with Eddie Murphy on her skull
She like, "Jigga Man, why you treat me like animal?"
I'm like excuse me Ms. Fufu, but when I met your ass
you was dead broke and naked, and now you want half
I got this ho that after twelve million sold
Mami's a narcolyptic, always sleepin on Hov'
Gotta tie the back of her head like Deuce Bigalow
I got so many shemales across the globe..
