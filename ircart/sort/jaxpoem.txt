A POEM BY JAX
I am awash in Cakes and Pies
Eating
Devouring
Chocolate Chip Cookies are strewn in my path
I eat cupcakes of doom
The Non-Fatties all hate me for they are not obese
I cry even as I eat
Could I find a tastier place to be
Intoxicated with Doughnuts
No solace for Pastries
I will show the world one day
Endless life in the refrigerator
