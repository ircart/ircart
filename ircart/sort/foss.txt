Anyone who says "F/OSS" is a tool. Free software hates Open Source because Open Source is the little sell out movement that doesn't give a fuck about the ideals. It's like True vs.  Nu metal. Stop associating Free Software even remotely with Open Source because those of us in the Free Software movement probably hate you.
