Wishing on a dream that seems far off
Hoping it will come today
Into the starlit night
Foolish dreamers turn their gaze
Waiting on a shooting star

But
What if that star is not to come?
Will their dreams fade to nothing?
When the horizons darkens most
We all need to believe there is hope

Is an angel watching closely over me?
Can there be a guiding light I've yet to see
I know my heart should guide me but
There's a hole within my soul

What will fill this emptiness inside of me?
Am I to be satisfied without knowing?
I wish is then for a chance to see
Now all I need (desparately)
Is my star to come...
