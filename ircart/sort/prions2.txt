Have you  eaten  ground beef  recently?  Ground beef is the result of everything
outside of  the  cow's  bones  (including nerves)  being  ground up. Ground beef
often contains  prions   (misfolded proteins)  which  due  to  mammalic  protein
metabolism act  virally and will cause you to come  down with  Creutzfeldt-Jakob
Disease (CJD) where your brain slowly decays due to holes forming in your brain,
as the proteins in your body lose their ability to fold properly. Do you feel as
smart as you were last week or last month? You may have it. Meat has always been
murder,  but now,  when you serve beef, you may be  murdering  the ones you love
and even yourself.   There IS a healthy alternative!  Visit www.vegan.org today!
