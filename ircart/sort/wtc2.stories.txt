i wrote this in the time of
deep thinking thoughts...i'd appreciate a response...
"LIVING IN THE STATE OF NINE ELEVEN"
U.S.A- was changed forever from unexpected hate...
still remember it today, 
like it happened yesterday...
i missed the first- 
but cought the second plane...
destruction came-when
terror hit the trade...
911
how come- 
military defences- 
were only set to dectect bombs...
WHO THE FUCK COULD DO THIS-
how come...
maby its cuz bush didn't respect the comp...
get over it-
move on-
the day's gone...
911
help-
send police-firefighters-and paramedics...
i'll FOREVER praise-
falling peoples heroic efforts...
could never forget it-WATCHING-
all the news coverage-
everyone was different...
got-not a clue-
to what we seeing-
will affect all of us living...
911
im calling back,
knowing you seen the first building colaps...
stunned and shocked-
unable to grasp-
one single thought- of getting MAD...
quicker then said-
anger was giving in...
and evil thinking-
took over what to do to them...
911
later its known-
we cought wind of there plan...
but let it go-
wasn't the first -and-
won't be the last one we have...
terrorfying acts in the past-
could never surpass...
the impact on americans-
with intent to get back...
SEPTEMBER 11TH
befor this-
it was at best- a freinds birthday...
now it remembered as- 
terrorism-
ground zero- 
and when we lost the world trade...
its easy to say-
this is a world of hate...
we've suffered in pain-
in the worst way...
SEPTEMBER 11th
was THE DAY-
that joined all americans...
know we looking past skin color-
here,there, and-
every where you live...
I relized-
other situations-
i never cared like this...
untill eight walls fell down-
because of some terrorists...
SEPTEMBER 11th
memorial's-
could tell you know, how the story goes...
but soul's still float-
lost-
gone, and don't know...
someone's
sister-
dad-
mom-
and bro...
rasing fist till this day-
pissed cuz they stay-
in a war zone...
SEPTEMBER11th is gone...it's time to move on...
i'm down with bringing the troops home...
