      THIS
      THIS GAME HAS RAT WHO COOKS BUT HE DOES NOT COOK
      VERY MUCH IN THIS GAME.  HIS RESTAURANT MUST BE
      FAILING WITH ALL OF THE TIME OFF HE IS TAKING.
      THIS IS WHY SMALL BUSINESSES FAIL SO MCUH IT IS
      A LACK OF WORK ETHIC.
      HE IS BUSY SLIDING DOWN WALLS AND JUMPING OFF OF
      THEM LIKE MEGAMANS IN MEGAMAN X.  EXCEPT HE IS
      AS EFFECTIVE AS MEGAMAN WITHOUT A ROBOT SUIT AND
      EQUIPPED WITH ONLY RUSH MARINE FOR THE ENTIRE GAME
      AND ALSO WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO ATTACK.
      MAN.
      WHAT WAS THE DEAL WITH THAT MOVIE EVAN ALMIGHTY.
      STEVE CARELL IS SUCH A DICK NO I WILL NOT DO THE
      DANCE SHUT THE FUCK UP IS THAT THE CHICK FROM
      GILMORE GIRLS WTF GET OUT OF THE MOVIE.  HOW
      MANY TIMES DOES THE MAN HAVE TO CONVINCE YOU
      THAT HE IS GOD BEFORE YOU FUCKING LISTEN TO HIM.
      HE KNOWS EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU A GODDAM ZOO IS
      FOLLOWING YOU AND YOU LOOK LIKE KENNY ROGERS
      AND SPEAKING OF THE GAMBLER YOU SHOULD KNOW WHEN
      TO HOLD EM KNOW WHEN TO FOLD EM - FOLD YOUR
      CAREER STEVE CARELL IF YOUR CHARACTER WAS SUPPOSED
      TO HAVE BEEN HIGH IN THE MOVIE INSTEAD OF BEING
      TALKED TO BY GOD YOU WOULD NOT HAVE HAD TO CHANGE
      YOUR PERFORMANCE.  SUCH VERSATILITY.  ALSO WHY
      DIDNT GOD JUST STOP THE "FLOOD" (FUKKEN SMALLEST
      AMOUNT OF WATER EVER THEY COULD HAVE JUST DRIVEN
      2 MILES AND BEEN FINE).  GOD IS SUCH A DICK.

      CORNERED ON PLAYING GOD.  THAT MUST LOOK GOOD ON
      THE RESUME.
