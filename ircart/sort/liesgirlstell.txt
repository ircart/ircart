This is written from a guy's perspective after weeks of research and thought:  I hope you like it.

I think the reason most guys are filed directly into the "I just think of you as a really good friends. Only as a friend." is because they don't mistreat women.  That's right, the truth is out.  Most guys I know treat girls like shit and get plenty more coming.  Why?  [b]Because women like it.[/b]  This is the truth.  Women date "Bad Guys" who are rule-breaking, drug-taking miscreants.  Why date bad guys?  Ask a woman and she'll give you a variety of reasons.

Some rationalize that it's more exciting to date "Bad Guys".  They've never hung out with me late at night when I'm hyper, but they automatically assume guys who smoke Newports across the street from the school are more "exciting".  Give me a fucking break, bitches.

[b][u]Lie Number Two[/b][/u] courtesy of [b]Kat[/b]Next point on our agenda:  Girls say "Bad Guys" make for like a project.  They think they can "fix" a guy and view him as a challenge.  This is completely logical.  Just like the following scenario:

"Hello, welcome to Bob's Furniture Warehouse, your number one source for quality furniture at rock bottom prices.  How can I help you?"

"Hi, I was wondering if you had any *broken* furniture.  You know, the kind that customers have sat in, leaned back, and fucking broken?  I'm not looking for a comfortable seat, I'm looking for furniture to fix up."

"You do realize you're going to spend more fixing it than you would in buying a regular one?"

"I don't care."

"And that you have no real qualifications for fixing one?  And that you run the risk of harming yourself?"

"I don't care." 

"I think I can guarantee that this furniture will never be as good as the day it was made, no matter what you do to it."

"I don't care."

The lesson from this?  Women like to manipulate and form guys into something that they're not, just to suit woman's needs.  Women are unwilling to compromise, they only want you to change.  If we read further into this, how women say they like improving guys to fit their needs, we can make further conclusions.  Women like to manipulate guys, simply for the sake of manipulation.  Messing up guys and their friendships is a sport now.

Girls say they feel protected by bad guys.  It's understandable.  I'd feel protected by some guy who gets into fights in school more frequently, because he has more practice fighting.  Never mind a geek who wouldn't dream of offending the sensibilities of a muscled moron, except in that a girl might come to her senses, and date him.  Then Se√±or Asshole will come and initiate a fight, because he feels that $geek [i]took[/i], that's right, [i]took[/i] away his girlfriend.  Instead of the conclusion that $exGirlfriend, of her own free will, decided that $geek was better than that asshole she was dating.  Never mind that a rational person would *never* resort to violence in order to solve an affair of this nature.  It makes no sense.

[b][u]What this means for society[/b][/u], with many thanks given to [b]AtmaWeapon[/b]

Because girls are irrational during the years where they are [b]most fertile[/b], humanity is doomed.  Society condones this behavior by allowing the stupid to still exist.  When "bad guys" exist without being punished for their stupidity and misbehavior, this enforces in our society that you can exist "above the system" although you would be, in fact, "below the system."

Intelligence has been shown to be strongly influenced by genetics and environment.  Intelligence is a requirement for many high paying jobs, and parents who are stupid are likely to be poor.  Poorer areas, such as the inner city, have notoriously bad schools.  The children of the poor are at a disadvantage here:  they are denied a good education, and given crappy DNA to start out with.  Poor and uneducated people are unable to escape this cycle of poverty, and social welfare systems are doing nothing to help.  If you don't have a job, you're not going to be doing much all day, so you or your wife will be pregnant very frequently.  Conversely, intelligent people put off having children until after they have established their careers, and they have fewer children.  

So, we are at a point where the poor and stupid masses are reproducing faster than the intelligent upper classes.  Social welfare is the doom of our society right now.  As soon as Darwinism is cast aside, and "survival of the intelligent" isn't favored, we create a society that is going to crumble because it is weighed down by the sheer weight of the unintelligent.  As AtmaWeapon put it, "With no laws, nerds die."  Once society that allowed stupid to flourish has crumbled, Darwinism returns, and favors the strong, who will utterly destroy the intelligent.  Reorganization and return to civilization will be many years later, and a gradual process of extracting "intelligent" from the stupid.

Girls, in dating "bad guys" you are helping to destroy humanity.  I hope you feel guilty.
