I think I have depression, but I'm too afraid to tell anyone 'cause I hate to have people look down on me. Or something, I don't know. I don't care about anything anymore really, and I don't know why. Last year I couldn't wait to do stuff, but now... I don't want to do anything except, nothing. I need help, but I wouldn't take it if someone offered it.
