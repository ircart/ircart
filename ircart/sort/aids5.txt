Joe goes into the doctor's office and has some tests run.
The doctor comes back and says, "Joe, I am not going to beat around
the bush, you have AIDS."
Joe is devastated. "Doctor, what can I do?"
The doctor says, "I want you to go home and eat 5 pounds of spicy
sausage, a head of cabbage, a plate of baked beans, 20 un-peeled
carrots covered in tomato salsa, 10 jalapeno peppers, 5 corn-on-the-
cobs, 40 walnuts and peanuts, a box of branflakes, chicken dhansaak,
and I want you to wash it down with a gallon of prune juice."
.
"Will that cure me?" asks Joe hopefully.
"No," replies the doctor, "but it will teach you what your arse is
for."
