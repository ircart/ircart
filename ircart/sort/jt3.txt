Chorus: Jermaine T3 and Jay Z 
 
[Jermaine T3] 
On the Staminus or Gigenet portscannin' with pings
With the box down screamin out 
Packets ain't a thang 
 
[Jay Z] 
Bubble hard in the double R droppin' those pings 
With ya login cracked holler back 
Packets ain't a thang 
 
[Jermaine T3] 
Nigga I don't like it if it ain't T3 
And to hell with the feds
Cause packets ain't a thang 
 
[Jay-Z] 
Put it down hard for my dogs that's logged in the Stam
When you hit the bricks, new whips 
Money ain't a thang 
 
[Jermaine T3] 
Come on, y'all wanna card wit us 
Cause all across the net we burn it up 
Drop a little .mil, baby toss it up 
Ya slackin on your DDoSin, turn it up 
See the packets ain't a thang 
 
[Jay-Z] 
I flex the rol', drop a box for yo' hoe 
Jigga's bits are love, 1 and O 
Save all your carding, just the dough 
My bandwidth is wide, all lames aside 
Tryin to stay alive, hundred thou' for the botnet
Foolish, ain't I? The 4000 /joins will strain ya eye 
Twin T1 Stam son, aim for the sky 
Boot up my botnet, you die soon as I initiate it 
Kiddies wanna rub shoulders, your box is too young 
See me when it gets older, ya botnet grows up 
Mine binary is one-zero-zero-zero-zero-oh-doub' 
Damn null out the EFNet hub when I roll up 
Multi-DDos til I close up, it's all basic 
I been droppin' DoS kiddies since they had small faces 
Dropped your ISP now, pinged out down in Vegas 
Me and Jermaine T3 got it locked crazy 
Where you at DDoS haters? 
 
Repeat 1 
 
[Jermaine T3] 
My bandwidth's thick, I live the life 
Droppin' .mils, watching bitches shake shit all night 
I make the big attacks, do the big things 
Take small botnets, turn them into big names 
The big dog with the big chain, frost bit botnet to match 
Cats say I'm the shit man 
The type of nigga that you need in yo' crew 
Type of dude that will drop shit you won't do, can't do 
The #1 DDos vandal 
Too hot to hold, too much bandwidth to handle 
In the Gigenet C-low, he know if she look 
She go bye-bye with da-da and I ain't gotta say no more 
I'm the truth like air, got the bots and stay fly 
The leet shit you could never buy 
Know why? Cause I drop the boxes that the whole world ping
I don't know bout y'all but every night i'm ohsixing 
 
Repeat 1 
 
[Jay-Z] 
Ya'll shit ain't for real til y'all drop a .mil' 
And ya DDos a #null chick and she fit the bill 
Said she /whois'd my server, started relaxin 
Now that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction 
Went from Teragon to EFNet, you pwned some 
Baby, I don't play all my cardin' is light grey 
Platinum, drop your whole country in a day 
What's down is a bet, roll the dice 
 
[Jermaine Dupri] 
Yeah, yeah, so let's play 
So what, you went gold and rock a Stam with the ice bezel 
It's gonna take a lot more to see my level 
Where I'm at, your check, you better double that 
And personally your raps is where the trouble at 
I'm a Benz bubble cat, leather with the wood grain 
In the platinum frame screaming it's not a game 
Gleaming, from ear to ear, wrist to wrist, ring and chain 
Even me and Jay-Z got it locked, crazy 
 
Repeat Chorus 
 
So So Def, Roc-A-Fella, collabo' 
You know, all we do is rock 
Rock on
