Ole' Johnny Rebel produced many great songs in addition to the Southern National Anthem, "Nigger, nigger". Another of his masterpieces is the wondrous and awe inspiring "Move Them Niggers North". It's lyrics are reproduced here for all to enjoy. 


Move them niggers north,
Move them niggers north.
If they don't like our southern ways,
Then move them niggers north. 

Our South been invaded,
By a trashy lookin' crew.
They'll change our ways and take our schools
Away from me and you.
It's time for us to make a stand 
To keep our Southern ways.
We've got to give a helping hand;
It's unity that pays. 

Move them niggers north,
Move them niggers north.
If they don't like our southern ways,
Then move them niggers north. 

They're trying to start trouble,
By mixing up the races.
They'd be a whole lot better off
By staying in their places.
I like our Southland like it is,
I'm sure that you do to.
Ole' Martin Luther thinks it's his.
I know he's wrong, don't you? 

Move them niggers north,
Move them niggers north.
If they don't like our Southern ways,
Then move them niggers north 

It's time for us to make a stand 
To keep our Southern ways.
We've got to give a helping hand.
It's unity that pays. 

Move them niggers north,
Move them niggers north.
If they don't like our Southern ways,
Then move them niggers north
Move them niggers north,
Move them niggers north,
Move them niggers north.
