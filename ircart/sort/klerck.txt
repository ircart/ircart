Kevin Ealy (more popularly known as Kevin Klerck or simply Klerck) (December 28, 1982 . March 8, 2005), was an Internet persona who was active as a troll on several popular websites, most notably Slashdot, Shacknews and Squabble.org.
Klerck's best friend was a young canadian man, known by his first name Mike(or Michael), also know as mef on the IRC network EFNET. Mike had an extreme amount of affection for his late irc friend klerck, and for one reason or another, made the tragic decision to steal Kevin's corpse.  He took it all the way back to Canada in a sheet, and took it into his basement where he laid it on a beautiful handmade wooden bed.
He dressed him in a tank top and shorts, and Kevin's favorite pair of glasses which can be seen on his wikipedia page. He then meticulously embalmed and mummified klerck, inserting a fleshlight into his anal cavity. This was already odd enough, until one of Mike's friends revealed that he indeed has sex with the corpse almost every night. 
He apparently still feel's love for his friend Kevin, but this is in the least, bizzare.  However It does not appear to be illegal, and Kevin's poor corpse is ravaged every night. Thank God his soul is already in Heaven.
