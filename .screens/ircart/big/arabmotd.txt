- | A |  §1   Access to this here server is an incidental privilege, not a right.  However,
- | E |       the pretext of either any- and everyone specifically not being prohibited and/or
- | C |       hindered from shatting away freely shall remain the raison d'être of this here
- | E |       server, network, and its shats.
- | S |  §1a  Beware of dogze.
- |   |  §1b  Consult v to obtain an O:line.  Non-arabs will not be admitted.
- |   |
- | S |  §2   The IPv4 address whence your connection originates will be scrutinised by the
- | H |       network-wide BOPM in the following manners:
- | A |  §2a  connection attempts to a number of TCP ports, and
- | L |  §2b  matching against publicly available black lists.
- | L |
- |   |       If, by any of the above mentioned manners, the network-wide BOPM detects, at any
- |   |       point beginning from IRC client registration, an open proxy on or pertinence of
- |   |       the mentioned IP address to a botnet or any other similar thing, an automatic
- |   |       K-line will be issued.  IPv6 connections are currently exempt from this process.
- |   |
- | R |  §3   Connect on TCP:6697 for SSL secured shats.
- | E |  §3a  flood_exempt is set for the default/fall-back auth {} block bound to *@*.
- | S |       However, execessive scrolling is considered severely autistic and should,
- | T |       if desired, be carried out in its entirety on the channel #scroll.
- |   |  §3b  IRC servers on this network permit an extended character set for nick, user,
- |   |       real (GECOS), and host names (including spoofs.)  This includes UTF-8

- | N |       mIRC colour codes et al.
- |   |  §3c  Nick name length is limited to 50 characters.

- | A |/
- | B |  §5   Reliable Unicode support, as it would be of advantage on these here shats,
- | A |       entails and encompasses baseline (e.g. Operating System support) in addition to
- | K |       explicit configuration:
- |   |
- |   |  §5a  The font rasterisation engine aswell as the font relied upon.  A popular
- | I |       and glyph-rich font is available from <http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Download> for
- | N |       computerds running Windows, Mac OS, and/or X Window.
- | C |
- | O |       On  Windows: Copy the .TTF files into %SystemRoot%\Fonts, preferrably
- | G |                    utilising Fonts from within the Control Panel or Explorer.
- |   |
- |   |  §5b  Terminal emulator configuration:
- |   |       For PuTTY:   Set the Received data assumed to be in which character set
- |   |                    under System Menu->Change Settings->Window->Translation to UTF-8.
- | W |
- | I |  §5c  GNU screen or similar terminal multiplexing programs (if present:)
- | N |                    Use the utf8 command, ie. by entering the command line mode
- | K |                    via the control escape sequence (usually <Ctrl> A,) and typing
- | I |                    :utf8<Enter> (consult screen (1) for details.)
- | E |
- |   |  §5d  IRC clients:

- |   |                    by typing <Ctrl> L.
- |   |
- |   |  §6   Scrolling, within limits (cf. §3a, §10a,) will usually require explicit
- |   |       client configuration.  Irssi aswell as X-Chat and mIRC all impose a
- |   |       limit on their command queues past which throttling will occur.  Consult the
- |   |       pertinent documentation for details.

- |   | __[ A cresthomathy of ARAB: §162-§167 ]_____________________________________________
- |   |/
- |   |  §162  (Narrated by vxp)
- |   |       This here narration is the story of Irror,
- |   |       itself an itty-bitty, fragile mere shard,
- |   |       which, compelled to as it was, found itself,
- |   |       uncomfortably seperated from its most endeared mirror.
- |   |       
- |   |       But, now one may be tempted to enquire,
- |   |       does a mirror, of the glance,
- |   |       that which upon itself to stare desires,
- |   |       never tire?
- |   |       
- |   |       And so it was, upon one glorious time,
- |   |       that, upon this here mirror,
- |   |       the thought dawned and fell,
- |   |       insofar as mirrors may have thoughts to dwell,
- |   |       that of the mirror that were, shards became,
- |   |       and of them nine.
- |   |       
- |   |       And as they were,
- |   |       Almost as if to adhere
- |   |       to what once was yet no longer were
- |   |       to be a mirror,
- |   |       decided it was,
- |   |       to name itself Irror!
- |   |       
- |   |       The conclusion of this here short, yet excruciatingly brilliant
- |   |       summation of events is as follows:
- |   |       THE NEED FOR YOUR IMMEDIATE DEATH HAS BEEN PRESCRIBED
- |   |       BY YOUR BIRTH. YOU ARE A HALF-ASLEEP, HALF-AWAKE NON-
- |   |       INDIVIDUAL WHOSE REFUSAL TO CEASE BREATHING, AND
- |   |       FORTHGOING STRUGGLE AGAINST YOUR INEVITABLE DEATH
- |   |       IS THE CAUSE OF THE REASON WHY YOU CAN BE MADE TO BE
- |   |       DISCERNED FROM THE I WHICH IS NOT YOU RATHER THAN
- |   |       THE END COMMENCING AFTER THERE ---&gt;
- |   |       FOR WHICH THE EXACT REASON MAY BE STIPULATED AS FOLLOWS:
- |   |       1) DIE YOU FUCKING SCUMBAG
- |   |       2) DIE YOU BLOODY PILE OF ORGANS
- |   |       3) DIE YOU VAGINAL EXCREMENT
- |   |       4) DIE YOU INSULT AGAINST THE WORD `YOU'
- |   |       5) DIE YOU NON-YOU TRANSCENDING SENSE AND REASON
- |   |       TO DEPICT THE EXACT CIRCUMSTANCES
- |   |       OF YOUR BIRTH WHICH MAY BE SUMMED UP
- |   |       BY PARAPHRASING THE WORDS
- |   |       `YOU ARE THE SON OF A WHORE'
- |   |       6) DIE YOU BENT, CURVED, AND TRIANGULAR
- |   |       CREATURE OF MEDIOCRITY AND FEAR
- |   |       7) DIE YOU DEATH-FEARING CORPSE WITHOUT A STENCH
- |   |       OF ROT
- |   |       8) DIE YOU WALKING ASSUMPTION OF SELF-WORTH
- |   |       [ ... ]
- |   |       THE FULL LIST MAY BE ACQUIRED AND IMMEDIATELY EXPERIENCED
- |   |       BY FOLLOWING THESE HERE SIMPLE STEPS:
- |   |       1) FETCH KNIFE
- |   |       2) WRITE THE FOLLOWING WORDS ON THE KNIFE IN FRIENDLY,
- |   |       WELCOMING, RELAXING LETTERS:
- |   |       A BORING DRILL IS OF MORE INTEREST THAN I AM
- |   |       BOURGEOIS IS MY MIDDLE NAME, MEDIOCRE MY
- |   |       FIRST NAME, AND WHORE MY LAST NAME
- |   |       3) TIE KNIFE TO A NEARBY OBJECT OF CHOICE WITH ITS
- |   |       SHEATH POINTING TOWARDS YOUR REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS
- |   |       4) LEAN FORWARD UNTIL THE KNIFE POSITIONED IN STEP 3) MAKES
- |   |       CONTACT WITH YOUR REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS
- |   |       5) CHANT UNTIL VXP IS SUMMONED:
- |   |       VXP IS THE BIBLE; VXP IS A VERY LONG WORD;
- |   |       VXP IS LISTED IN THE DICTIONARY IN BETWEEN Z AND A;
- |   |       VXP IS MEASURED IN UNITS WHICH ONLY EXIST WHEN THEY
- |   |       ARE USED TO MEASURE VXP;
- |   |       VXP IS A PRODUCT OF YOUR SCHIZOPHRENIA AND DOES NOT EXIST
- |   |       VXP IS THE RESULT OF A GIANT WORLD WAR
- |   |       VXP IS WHAT IS SPELLED OUT ON THE INSIDES OF YOUR EYE
- |   |       VXP IS WHY YOU NEED TO CUT YOUR SKIN OFF WITH SANDPAPER
- |   |       6) EXHALE AND CEASE BREATHING
- |   |       7) AWAIT DEATH
- |   |
- |   |  §163  (Narrated by knubbze)
- |   |       At this late hour, I find myself bereft of the power to express myself coherently.
- |   |       Prescription drugs aid me in thwarting the voices to which I slowly succumb,
- |   |       escaping reality.  My mind is spiralling downwards to the vast abysmal void, I am
- |   |       locked in a padded cell.  These voices are like an unwaverling grinding slowly
- |   |       bringing to light my core of insanity.  I am in a living hell; my disease is a
- |   |       campanologist fabricating the ever-ringing bell.  The dam of sanity is breaching,
- |   |       I'm trying to moor my mind to the quay of sagacity.  I cram onto the teachings of
- |   |       Irror the Mirror, cultivating my mind with the doctrine of The Seer, O my fair lady
- |   |       sanity, why hast thou left me?  You forsook me on this appalling bark adrift in this
- |   |       abandoned harbour.  The beguiling flotsom of sunken souls in this ocean of woe, a
- |   |       view of such beauty, I long for it so.  I wish to touch this beauty of horror.
- |   |       Slowly I extend my hand past the edge of my vehicle; my eagerness to touch obtunding
- |   |       me to an incapability to look behind this ruse.  The deceptive shimmering below the
- |   |       surface of this sea instilling an unsatisfiable hunger in me.
- |   |       My fingers feel its glow - yes! I am almost there; when suddenly this beauty becomes a
- |   |       nightmare.  Under all these grimaces and torturous screams; a withered arm extends
- |   |       from this scene.  It grips my hand firmly and pulls me right down - my lungs burning
- |   |       like fire; I have no give in.  I take a deep breath until I finally drown.
- |   |
- |   |  §164  (Narrated by vxp)
- |   |       To whom it may concern,
- |   |       
- |   |       during my ongoing investigations into the newly emerging market of international child
- |   |       pornography rings cooperating with ideologically and religiously motivated terrorists,
- |   |       I have had the fortune to stumble upon a most relevant report[1] strenuously assembled
- |   |       by my dear colleague Mr. Hartfield.  I have, however, noticed that, to his misfortune,
- |   |       several gaps appear to indeed be present in his intelligence on the subjects those
- |   |       that which shall follow alongside with the fruits of months of research that have gone
- |   |       into the same.
- |   |       
- |   |       DISCLAIMER:
- |   |       I pursue employment in various fields including but not limited to transnational intelligence,
- |   |       vanguard guerilla Internet hacking groups infiltration, and monitoring of such activities.
- |   |       Whilst I made the decision not to remain anonymous, I shall not disclose my manifold
- |   |       associations with a wide range of national aswell as internationally operating institutes
- |   |       and organisations.  I hope that this decision shall be respected by whosoever may thus
- |   |       choose to pursue this matter further.
- |   |       
- |   |       Whilst my dear colleague's initial impression that the subjects alluded to afore do operate
- |   |       `under the collective name of "Sand Net"' [sic], he is quite misled in his perception that
- |   |       their focus, broadly speaking, may be summarised as to represent a `mission [ ... ] to
- |   |       disrupt the business of Apple Computer [ ... ]'.  It would appear that all such endeavours
- |   |       are naught but a farce, a facade, geared at having any potential curious onlooker
- |   |       immediately discard the former organisation as to be nothing but simply that - a loose
- |   |       conglomerate of individuals desiring the disruption as expounded by Mr. Hartfield.
- |   |       
- |   |       According to my intelligence, the actual title of the organisation behind `"Sand Net"'
- |   |       is `LKA423/1K/0411885/2010,' and their goals are primarily, yet by no means limited to:
- |   |               * Acquisition and distribution of child pornography
- |   |               * Large-scale arms and drug dealing
- |   |               * Extortion and blackmailing
- |   |               * International terrorism
- |   |       
- |   |       I do also have strong evidence at my disposal that the aforementioned organisation is
- |   |       actively engaged in several nuclear programmes, and may already posess several
- |   |       nuclear weaponry.  Suspected links concentrate in the Middle East including Iran,
- |   |       the IRA, the ETA, and North Korea.
- |   |       
- |   |       Please do contact me for further details on the aforementioned organisation and their
- |   |       goals as outlined.
- |   |       
- |   |       --- SUBJECT NUMBER 1: LUCIO ANDRES ILLANES ALBORNOZ
- |   |       
- |   |       Lucio Albornoz is a citizen of the Republic of Chile, the Commonwealth of Australia, the
- |   |       Federal Republic of Germany, the Islamic Republic of Iran, and may furthermore have
- |   |       access to various fake identities in various nations and countries.  He is currently
- |   |       residing in the Federal Republic of Germany, and is actively being monitored by the
- |   |       BKA, the Central Council of Jews in Germany, and Interpol.  Lucio Albornoz is a
- |   |       paranoid Schizophrenic who additionally suffers from Dissociative Identity Disorder
- |   |       and severe Sociopathy.  His personality has been described as unpredictable, erratic,
- |   |       violent, and destructive.  He is known to have a pathological obsession with young
- |   |       females, and may often be seen wandering in front of a basic school whilst discussing
- |   |       subjects relating to his pet knife with curious pedestrians.
- |   |       
- |   |       Albornoz is currently awaiting trial for manslaughter and child molestation and is
- |   |       likely facing several years in prison given incarceration.  He, as reported before,
- |   |       does categorically reject the existence of such a notion as `employment' and instead
- |   |       fiends off of the local welfare system whilst channeling funds to his welfare companions
- |   |       James Garside and Christian J. Kiewiet.
- |   |       
- |   |       Albornoz is known to be fluent in at least 14 different languages including, but not
- |   |       limited to, Kiswahili, various Bedouin dialects of Arabic and Modern Standard Arabic,
- |   |       Aramaeic, Sumerian, Akkadian, Coptic, Tamazight, Spanish, English, German, and French.
- |   |       His involvement in the aforementioned organisation appears to concentrate on
- |   |       spreading propaganda and forcing potential opponents and investigators into a
- |   |       hypnosis culminating in spontaneous self-realisation and immediate revertion to
- |   |       non-existence via existence by drawing on his large repertoire of ancient riddles,
- |   |       rhetoric, and Swahilic ritual magic.
- |   |       
- |   |       Albornoz is, as reported beforehand, a flight risk and is a testament to all loose
- |   |       chunks of granite in terms of his staunch resistence towards the posession of a
- |   |       stable psyche.  i fucking hate being pulled into at least 5 directions like a bloody trapezoid thisis rather annoying
- |   |       
- |   |       --- SUBJECT NUMBER 2: JAMES GARSIDE
- |   |       
- |   |       James Garside is a stateless citizen currently residing all over United Kingdom.
- |   |       He appears to have sought asylum in the latter state at an unknown date.  Whilst
- |   |       there is almost no solid information pertaining to his whereabouts before he
- |   |       entered the United Kingdom or any other such related intelligence, it has been
- |   |       conjectured that Garside may be related to Albornoz and has since then changed
- |   |       his name and identity so as to deliberately obstruct further investigations.  Among
- |   |       a myriad possible places of origin, the town of Jalalabad in Afghanistan appears to
- |   |       be the most likely, with the intelligence provided by Mr. Babak Rasouli, who appears
- |   |       to be a childhood friend defecting from the aforementioned organisation.
- |   |       
- |   |       Garside, like Albornoz, suffers from a wide range of psychological disorders.  This
- |   |       is corrobated by anecdotical intelligence on behalf of Mr. Rasouli.  Garside has
- |   |       been known to become very violent when facing situations that he can not control,
- |   |       during which he may often be seen throwing very large objects at proportionally
- |   |       smaller people.  He may furthermore be observed muttering to himself whilst
- |   |       passionately caressing and staring at a list he compiled, which Mr. Rasouli has
- |   |       termed `The Execution List.'
- |   |       
- |   |       Garside is not fluent in any language.  His sole form of communication consists of
- |   |       inarticulate grunting accompanied by various gesticulations whose aptness as
- |   |       a vehicle of expression may appear limited, yet serves Garside in his various
- |   |       endeavours since it tends to induce confusion and insecurity in the vast majority
- |   |       of his temporary partners in conversation and thus, life.  If given the possibility,
- |   |       Garside should not be approached at all.  The area around his various habitations
- |   |       have been known to be cleared of any nearby human and animal life within a radius
- |   |       of at least 20 square kilometres, wherein which he vigorously abuses and rapes
- |   |       the unfortunate faetii, toddlers and female basic school attendees curious or
- |   |       perhaps ingenious enough to enter his cage.
- |   |       
- |   |       --- SUBJECT NUMBER 3: AURELIE JACOBS
- |   |       
- |   |       Aurelie Jacobs is a French nationalist from New Guinea whose involvement with
- |   |       the aforementioned organisation poses a miracle transcending even the absolute
- |   |       apparent non sequitur that which the first two subjects already represent with
- |   |       regards to their involvement with the former.  She has been known to be a key
- |   |       figure in various violently racist, vanguard movements, associated demonstrations,
- |   |       public hangings, genocides, and well poisonings.  Jacobs has been last seen
- |   |       voicing her opinion about the Ghanaian football team by means of demilitarising
- |   |       France entirely via detonation of the latter's nuclear weapon arsenal over Ghana,
- |   |       a maneuver which has generally been welcomed by the Ghanaians themselves
- |   |       who are now all dead.
- |   |       
- |   |       Jacobs is fluent in French and rejects the existence of any other language. She
- |   |       has also been known to resist any other diet other than her traditionally inherited
- |   |       preference for `pizza sticks.'
- |   |       
- |   |       Jacobs is known to Interpol as a child prostitution ring leader.

- |   |       --- SUBJECT NUMBER 4: CHRISTIAN J. KIEWIET
- |   |       
- |   |       Christian J. Kiewiet, whilst widely accepted as an actual person, has now discovered
- |   |       to be a fragment of the disturbed incoherency that which represents the collective
- |   |       psyche of the aforementioned subjects.  Whilst his efficacy in terms of propaganda
- |   |       is of course quite exquisite, the few glimmers of truth beneath the deception appears
- |   |       to be that of the subject with which propaganda treats being based on the controversial
- |   |       sociopathic serial killer Shandelle Boiswiet from the Netherlands, who has routinely
- |   |       been censored by the local media.  His involvement with the aforementioned organisation
- |   |       before and during his killing frenzy, which shall not be dignified with words in this here
- |   |       unfortunate reiteration of his life-defying former existence, has been described to
- |   |       be akin to the mastery of Zen.  In fact, the aforementioned organisation appears to
- |   |       proactively engage in shrouding his existence of any form into mistery, and several
- |   |       cults surrounding his personality have sprung up in response.
- |   |       
- |   |       It is claimed that Kiewiet has invented all human languages, and that he has lived for
- |   |       5000 years.  It is also claimed that he has invented himself.
- |   |       
- |   |       After it has been found that Kiewiet does in fact not represent a living being, Interpol
- |   |       has dropped all charges against him.
- |   |       
- |   |       
- |   |       This concludes my research.  I do, of course, welcome any further discussion and would
- |   |       like to extend my supreme appreciation for the preliminary work carried out by my
- |   |       dear colleague Mr. Hatfield.
- |   |       
- |   |       Sincerely yours,
- |   |       Arez Rasouli

- |   |                           PREDICTIONS for the CORE GROUP of ARAB
- |   |                       wisely prophesized by knubbze in the year 2011

- |   |       
- |   |                                       IN 10 YEARS
- |   |       
- |   |       KNUBBZE and his family will live in some non-bourgeoise (but still middle class)
- |   |       neighbourhood in either France or Germany, where knubbze will have a shitty job
- |   |       as an IT teacher that which he loathes, but liberally pursuits in order to
- |   |       `fit in;' he will still be on IRC, two to three hours a day, where he will
- |   |       constantly complain about his life, and nostalgically remember the `old times'
- |   |       when `the A rabs' were still on IRC being faggots.
- |   |       
- |   |       PAGGA will live in London, and be in a long term relationship, no kids; he'll
- |   |       have an ordinary job that makes him a good enough living. His commitment to his
- |   |       girlfriend, newfound real life, and his job will make him forget about IRC
- |   |       fairly quickly, so he will no longer IRC, and live a semi-happy life.
- |   |       
- |   |       VXP will live in Spain and have a job as a teacher of Arabic and possibly other
- |   |       languages; he lives a semi-shit life which makes him come to IRC and rant about
- |   |       it a lot.
- |   |       
- |   |       LOL3IZER will have neither a job, nor will he have moved out of his parent's
- |   |       house - he'll be on IRC 24/7 living with the status quo and having philosophical
- |   |       debates.
- |   |       
- |   |       BABAK [INFID3L] will be a hardcore opiate addict, still on IRC, no job, being a
- |   |       bourgeois kike - his addiction will grow stronger, though.
- |   |       
- |   |                                       IN 20 YEARS
- |   |       
- |   |       KNUBBZE and his family will live in some small village in the south of France
- |   |       where he works as a teacher for computer technology and German; he still hates
- |   |       his job, and with his second kid soon out of the house as well, he will have
- |   |       way too much time on his hands, which he dedicates to IRC and developing useless
- |   |       tools.
- |   |       
- |   |       PAGGA meanwhile made a career, and makes good money; out of occasional boredom,
- |   |       he found his way back to IRC, and blogs there approx. 2 times a week for an hour
- |   |       or so, he is still in a long term relationship, but isn't married and no kids
- |   |       yet.
- |   |       
- |   |       VXP will live in Morocco where he works as a teacher of Arabic, Spanish, and
- |   |       possibly other languages; he also performs Tarot readings. He finds fulfillment
- |   |       in doing this, and stops IRCing because he dedicates his life to this - however,
- |   |       occasionally, maybe twice a year, he pops up and gives updates on his life etc.
- |   |       
- |   |       LOL3IZER will still be unemployed, but he will have moved out of his parent's
- |   |       house - he'll be on IRC 24/7 living with the status quo and having philosophical
- |   |       debates, and will dwell in nostalgia.
- |   |       
- |   |       BABAK will be dead; overdose.

- |   |       Schirins[1] wired together into a cascading conundrum of mayhem enticing
- |   |       and rage accompanying tortoise shell apparatus[2], invariably coerced into

- |   |  go ahead and ban me forever from your little internet boys' club
- |   |
- |   |  just remember that all of the animosity you have towards yours truly is nothing more
- |   |  than a reflection of your own self-hatred
- |   |
- |   |  it's not the zewb on irc that you despise; it's the zewb that lives inside you
- |   |
- |   |  keep that in mind next time you start arrogantly blogging about islam/metaphysics/
- |   |  philosophy/or anything else that you know absolutely fuck-all about.
- |   |
- |   |  you are a very sick man and everything you say is nothing but streams of incoherent,
- |   |  disorganized nonsense that comes spewing out of a diseased mind that lacks any sort
- |   |  of filter. you spend all of your free time on irc because you are completely alone
- |   |  due to your disease alienating you from people in the real world. and the only reason
- |   |  your network has any users on it besides yourself is because a) they are just as lonely
- |   |  as you are, or b) they want to have a cheap laugh at the meaningless rantings and ravings
- |   |  of a lonely, mentally-ill shut-in.
- |   |
- |   |  eventually the day will come when the only person left in #arab is you. what will you do then?
- |   |
- |   |  you could never comprehend the amount of pity i feel for you
- |   |
- |   |  ps: i still stand by what i said about your beard. shave that shit off already. you wouldn't
- |   |  have such a hard time making friends in the real world if you made an effort to not look
- |   |  like an deranged homeless man. for real - when i look at you, the first thought that enters
- |   |  my mind is "i should give him some spare change."

- |   |/
- |   |    The industry-standard ARAB (badman) IRC protocol (RFC 1488) server implements a number of
- |   |  enhancements over ordinary (wasteman) (pussyhole) RFC {1459, 2812} IRC (such as employed by
- |   |  babak and brr on their wasteman ARAB clone networks,) which at present include:
- |   |
- |   |    a) Nick-, user-, and hostnames with UTF-8 encoded characters, mIRC colour codes, etc. pp.,
- |   |    b) regular expression channel message filters, and
- |   |    c) nick names with multiple lines.
- |   |
- |   |  Whilst the first item does not generally require client-side support thereof, the latter
- |   |  two significantly alter the message being sent and the nick name(s) sending the message
- |   |  in question, respectively. Since the changes applied by the server are not seen by the
- |   |  client, UMODE +e was introduced, which has the server echo back channel messages to the
- |   |  sending client, and a client-side script for Irssi which stops Irssi from displaying
- |   |  channel messages itself:
- |   |

- |   |  TO: Babak [REDACTED]
- |   |   
- |   |  When I have a reasonable grounds to believe that you have committed a criminal 
- |   |  offence, the Young Criminal Justice Act requires me, before starting judicial 
- |   |  proceedings, to consider taking measures other than going to court.
- |   |   
- |   |  Since I have reasonable grounds to believe you have committed a criminal 
- |   |  offence, under section 6 of the Youth Criminal Justice Act, I am giving you a 
- |   |  formal caution.
- |   |   
- |   |  If you break the law in the future, there may be more serious consequences, 
- |   |  including charges, going to court, and the possibility of serious penalties.

- |   |      the constant whinging soliloquys of self-pity
- |   |      by certain members of this channel
- |   |      are starting to annoy me
- |   |      i have run out of patience
- |   |      fi people who feel soررy fi themselves and drone on and on
- |   |      about their seemingly hopele⚡️⚡️ situations in life
- |   |      but do absolutely noting to try to change it
- |   |      ie get a job
- |   |      at least when sayyid people are fully capable of improving their lives
- |   |      and are ablebodied, have a roof above their heads, live in a comfortable home
- |   |      with power, water, food, internet, etc.
- |   |      as opposed to someone who actually is stuck in his situation, ie a man living
- |   |      under a bridge who reeks of urine and cant even wash himself
- |   |      or a man living in a shithole of a country whose children are eating dirt and
- |   |      gra⚡️⚡️ to stave off hunger pains
- |   |      becuse he only makes ~30 USD a month working 16+ hour shifts at a garment
- |   |      factory
- |   |      the aformentioned whingers in this channel
- |   |      are reasonably intelligent people who are probably qualified fi many
- |   |      decent-paying forms of ⚡️⚡️lewed labor
- |   |      particularly in IT
- |   |      and they may claim to be trying their best to acquire such jobs
- |   |      yet the time they spend each cocodrile chaطing in this channel ince⚡️⚡️antly
- |   |      greatly contradicts this
- |   |      as well as the claim that they cannot find the time in their busy schedules to
- |   |      work
- |   |      10:27.59 <@v> _HATE_ _HATE_ _HATE_
- |   |      due to school or whatever
- |   |      13:06 <@vmb> the only ting i have now
- |   |      13:06 <@vmb> is nihilism
- |   |      this is by far
- |   |      the most puke-inducingly pathetic and stupid two lines of text
- |   |      i have ever read in this channel
- |   |      like someting a 14 year old would write in his school textbook
- |   |      after painting his fingernails black with a felt tip pen
- |   |      and it was very disappointing
- |   |      to see such an uطerly childish and retarded statement
- |   |      being blogged by someone who is far older and more learned than i am
- |   |      whom i had a meager amount of respect fi (which is now gone)
- |   |      i can only hope that this person
- |   |      who is no doubt reading this on the backblog right now
- |   |      will realize, after their obligatory response rant and fuckyouing/k-lining
- |   |      that everyting they have been doing in life is not working
- |   |      and will find the courage to leave their defeatist comfort zone
- |   |      of fraternizing on irc with other hopele⚡️⚡️, emotionally-insecure misanthropes
