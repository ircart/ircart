Now, this is a story all about how
My life got flipped-turned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there
I'll tell you how I fucked the prince of a town called Bel Air

In my hometown Bel air born and raised
At the library where I spent most of my days
Readin' and writin' thinkin' I'm cool
And upstaging my friends in everything in school
When a cousin of mine
Who was up to no good
Startin makin jokes about my manhood
He said one lil joke and I got sad
I said 'Will, you have no idea what you're talking about, now stop or I'll call Dad'

He laughed at my threat and when it got clear
That he didn't take me seriously, he slapped my rear
If anything I can say this act is wierd
But I thought 'Naw forget it' - 'Will, I am queer!'

I pulled down his pants, it was about 7 or 8 inches
And I yelled to my cousin 'Yo homes stick this in my britches'
He looked at my ass
It was finally inside
To sit on my cousin as the fag of Bel Air
