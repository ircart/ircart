[21:26] <StrongAxe> Hello. Who are you, and why were you pretending to be BuckCDN?
[21:27] <ramprat> i have come back from the grave to investigate the banning of numerous people from joining our bear community.
[21:27] <StrongAxe> That would be a neat trick
[21:28] <ramprat> the banning of those who are curious does not allow the community to grow. why are you oppressing our potential brothers.
[21:29] <StrongAxe> Because 99% of those who are curious are sent here from warez, mp3, xbox, wii, ps3, etc. sites by other idiots who send them here to look for stuff.
[21:30] <StrongAxe> After having a million bugs hit the windshield, we tend to keep the wiper blades running 24/7. Unfortunately, some innocent poeple get squashed too on occasion
[21:30] <ramprat> it should not be on, not oppressing those who might be lonely and looking for companions. only those who cause trouble should be evicted, not everyone
[21:31] <ramprat> i just had a present for the bear community in the form of a bearflag ascii
[21:31] <ramprat> but no one care.
[21:32] <StrongAxe> Unfortunately, most of the people who join ask stupid questions. So people who are in "highly suspect" channels like #xbox360, etc. are likely to get kicked on sight.
[21:33] <ramprat> :|
[21:33] <StrongAxe> And spoofing the name of a friend who recently died is NOT likely to win you many friends
[21:33] <ramprat> whos spoofing, i'm canadian and i hunt bucks
[21:33] <ramprat> :/
[21:34] <StrongAxe> Then why not BuckHntrCdn?
[21:34] <ramprat> doesn't fit
[21:40] <StrongAxe> Well, it's curious that you should mention the exact nick of someone who used to use it
[21:40] <StrongAxe> AND that you already knew he was dead
[21:42] <ramprat> i didn't know he was dead, but you sure made it seem that way by saying i was pretending.
[22:02] <StrongAxe> Whether he was dead or not, you were impersonating his nickname
[22:05] <ramprat> i wasn't impersonating his nick name. i didn't know he was dead but whatever
[22:06] <StrongAxe> yes, he is dead. we lost him due to complications while battling the aids virus
[22:07] <ramprat> fags.
