Love me or hate me, that is the question.
If you love me then Thank you!
If you hate me then fuck you!
Love me or hate me, its still an obsession.
Love me or hate me, that is the question.
If you love me then Thank you!
If you hate me then fuck you!

I'm fat, I need a diet.
No, in fact i'm just too light
And I ain't got the biggest breast-s-s, but I write all the best disses.
I got hairy armpits, but I don't walk around like this.
I wear a big baggy t-shirt that hides that nasty sh**.
Ugh!
Never had my nails done.
Bite them down until they're numb.
I'm the one with the non-existent bum,
Now I dont really give a....Ugh!
I'm late for my shepherd's pie
Like a high maintenance chick missin' her diamonds.
I'm missin' my clippers size.
Now bow down to your royal highness.
No I dont own a corgi,
Had a hamster, it died cuz I ignored it.
Go on then, go on report me,
I'm English, try and deport me!

[Chorus]
Love me or hate me, its still an obsession.
Love me or hate me, that is the question.
If you love me then Thank you!
If you hate me then fuck you!
Love me or hate me, its still an obsession.
Love me or hate me, that is the question.
If you love me then Thank you!
If you hate me then fuck you!

I'm that funky little monkey with the tiniest ears.
I don't like drinkin fancy champy, 
I'll stick wit Heineken beers.
Whoops, might burp in ya face,
A little unlady-like,
What can I say?
Well oh gosh i'm not posh, male wit odd socks.
I do what i'm doin YEAH!
So everybody's entitled to opinions,
I open my mouth and sh** I got millions.
I'm the middle kid, the riddle kid,
I'll make you giggle till your sick
Cuz my nose jiggles while I spit.
Yeah I do have some stories
And its true I want all the glory.
Go on then, come on support,
I'm English, try and deport me!

[Chorus]
Love me or hate me, its still an obsession.
Love me or hate me, that is the question.
If you love me then Thank you!
If you hate me then fuck you!
Love me or hate me, its still an obsession.
Love me or hate me, that is the question.
If you love me then Thank you!
If you hate me then fuck you!

So I cant dance and I really cant sing.
I can only do one thing, 
And that's be Lady Sovereign!
So I cant dance and I really cant sing.
I can only do one thing, 
And that's be Lady Sovereign!

[Chorus]
Love me or hate me, its still an obsession.
Love me or hate me, that is the question.
If you love me then Thank you!
If you hate me then fuck you!
Love me or hate me, its still an obsession.
Love me or hate me, that is the question.
If you love me then Thank you!
If you hate me then fuck you!
