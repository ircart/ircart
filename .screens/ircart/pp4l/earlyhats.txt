-This is a brief list of the lines/images that are found on Early Cuyler's trucker hats.

    * "Free Hat Limit 1"
    * "World's Greatest Illegitimate Daddy"
    * "May I Help You, My Child?" (as seen on a combination pope/trucker hat, when Early still had his job at Mattress Christ)
    * "Breathe If You're Horny"
    * "Here's The Beef"
    * "I Love Cock Fighting" (with the word "Fighting" appearing much smaller than the other three) {Seen in School days, Fool days} .
    * "Groom"
    * "Goal Bandit"
    * "2005 Prom King" {Seen in School days, Fool days}
    * "Booty Hunter"
    * "David Allan CEO Live In Macon" (a reference to outlaw country singer/songwriter David Allan Coe )
    * "GLUG"
    * A squid drawn in the shape of the Pontiac Firebird logo
    * A stylized American Flag with a bald eagle's head superimposed. (Seen in Chalky Trouble.)
    * Four aces drawn such that the ace of diamonds is on top and the rest (clubs, hearts, then spades) are fanned behind it.
    * A buck (male deer) with scribbles, used as a résumé to obtain employment at Dan Halen Sheet-rock Inc. The hat said "Can skin a buck, run a tro-tline, and all my rowdy friends are coming over tonight," according to Dan Halen, the character in charge of the interview. These are references to the Hank Williams Jr. songs "Country Boy Can Survive," and "All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight."
    * "Support Our Troops" (American flag design with a yellow ribbon). After he is struck by lightning it reads "Support Our oops."
    * "I Love You Daddy" (Written in pencil with a drawing of Rusty)
    * "Sonny LIED!!!" (Written on a Confederate battle flag designed hat). This is the motto of the opponents of Georgia Governor Sonny Perdue who won his office in part due to his promise to have a referendum on whether to return the Confederate Battle Flag emblem to the state flag but the option to use the "St. Andrews Cross" was not given, he adopted a less controversial design based on the more obscure first national flag of the Confederacy.
    * "Tricky Two" (Witten on a gold hat underneath a hand making the peace sign)
    * "God's Good Buddy" (Written underneath a semi truck with a cross on it driving out of the heavens.) Seen during a Squidbillies bump and Giant Foam Dickhat Trouble.
    * "Swayze Crazy" (Written in red lettering on a pink hat with Patrick Swayze flexing right arm.) Seen on an Adult Swim website ad.
    * "John Beer" (A play on John Deere, with the logo shown as a silhouette of a drunken anthropomorphic deer sprawled out among beer cans).
    * A bill connected to a donkey with a very obscene protrusion (censored) that offends everyone including Squid Jesus.
