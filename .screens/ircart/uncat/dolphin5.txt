                      In Me          Aspirations of the living
                   sea The dolphins do move within    me The aura of
                     their soul, I feel deep down To be in the water
                        and not on ground Sifting through the
                          ocean, an expressing show Communi-
                        cation of a song and a blow Pro-
                     tecting even those not of their
                  kind They ask nothing in return,
             they do not mind The most gracious
          and unselfish of all that wander I
      wish to swim with them, nothing   could
    be fonder The dolphins mean so     much
 to me, you see I need to thank      them,          o u no
