Cuz in the pool, I'm on the ball, like a round tip

And fuck the best, nigga I'm M
Bitches wanna fuck, like they're me, and I'm them

We talkin championship rings, I got 10
I'm on my champion shit mayne, It's lookin slim
Haha... for them, haha

[Chorus]
Now pack ya'll K's, leave ya'll knives

Coke dealas, dope dealas, we go get us
A body today, a body tonight
This is the life nigga, this is the life of a, N.O. nigga
That 5 nigga, that 'O' nigga, that 4 nigga
