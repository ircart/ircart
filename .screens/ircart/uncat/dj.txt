Murder one on one, the hottest nigga under the sun
I come from under the tummy, busting a tommy
Or come from under your garments, yo chest and your arm hit
Pow, one to the head now you know he dead
Now you know I play it, like a pro in the game
Naw better yet a veteran a hall of fame
I got that medicine, I'm better than all the names
Ay its Cash Money Records man a lawless gang
Put some water on the track, Fresh for all his flame
Wear a helmet when you bang it man and guard yo brain
Cuz the flow is spasmatic what they call insane
That aint even a muthafuckin aim I get dough boy
And you already know that pimping
18 how I'm living young'n show that Bentley
Stunna my Pa so you know that's in me
Gotti my mentor so don't go there wit me

[Hook]
[Repeat X2]

[Lil Wayne]
And I move like the Coupe thru traffic
Rush hour GT Bent' roof is absent
Ya bitch present wit the music blasting
And she keep asking how it shoot if its plastic
I tell her you see if ya boy run up, she sat back and cut the Carter back
up, oh fa sho
Ay Big Mike they betta step they authority up
Before they step to a sergeant's son, I got army guns
You niggas never harming young, fly wizzy my opponents done, I'm done talking
And I ain't just begun, I been running my city like Diddy ya chump
I fly by ya in a foreign whip, on the throttle wit a model bony bitch
Pair of phony tits, her hair is long and shit, to her thong and shit
Well here we go so hold on to this, uh lets go

[Lil Wayne talking]
Hold on let me hit the blunt
So go, so go
This is the, this is the, this is the

This is the Carter

[Hook X1]

[Lil Wayne]
Birdman put them niggas in a trash can
Leave em outside of your door I'm your trash man
I'm steady lighting another hash and riding in my jag
You will need a gas mask man
You snakes, stop hiding in the grass
Sooner or later I'll cut it knock the blades in yo ass
You homo niggas getting Aids in the ass
While the homie here tryna get paid in advance
I'm staying on my grizzy I'ma bonafide hustler
Play me or play wit me then I'm going find your mother
Niggas wanna eat cuz they ain't ate nothing
But niggas wanna leave when you say you out of mustard
So I'ma walk into the restaurant alone, leaving out
Leaving behind just residue and bones
In your residents with Rugers to your dome
Like where the fuck you holding the coke, holding your throat, choke

This, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this, this
This is the Carter

[Hook X1]

Go DJ, DJ, DJ
